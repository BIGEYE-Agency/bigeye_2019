What to Expect in Marketing in 2011 and what you need to know,"If 2010 was up for a marketing superlative, it would definitely be voted “Most Likely to Succeed.” This past year, we saw the launch of the iPad, the expansion of the Facebook “Like” button to other popular websites and the rise of singer-songwriter Justin Bieber, who can thank YouTube for the fact that he can now retire at age 16. But while 2010 focused on finding new, bigger and better vehicles to market products and <a title=""services"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//agency/"">services</a>, 2011 will focus on tying them all together. Gunning for the “Best-All-Around” title, 2011 will be the year that we see businesses weave online, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print</a>, broadcast, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile</a>, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> initiatives together into a greater marketing plan to achieve bigger goals. And the leaders of the pack will be those who recognize this need to take a step back and see the bigger picture. Read on to find out more about Covenant’s projections for 2011, and how big-picture thinking could lead to a big ROI.
<h3>1. Video</h3>
In the next three years, 90 percent of the Internet will be video, according to <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/web/services/index.html"">Cisco Systems</a>. Video has become a powerful way to talk directly to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> and build upon or strengthen the relationship they’ve already established with your brand. Video can also be repurposed on multiple platforms, from your company’s website to its Facebook Fan page. Your customers can even share the videos with their friends and family by reposting links or by embedding the video itself onto other Web pages. And the unique thing about video is that it can still be viewed years after it is initially posted.

There are many ways that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video can be utilized</a> on the Web to not only <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">promote your brand</a>, but also to establish it as the go-to resource in your industry. If you’re a healthcare facility, add a five-minute tutorial on tips to avoid the flu before cold season (such as washing your hands, just like Mom always said). If you’re a homebuilder, show short clips of a remodeled cabinet you did, with before and after shots. The idea is to think of a topic that will interest your customers, and then hire a professional to do the work. While flip cameras are great for taping your grandma doing the electric slide at your cousin’s wedding, they won’t deliver the same professional look and feel that a production company can. In order to effectively position your products and services in your marketplace, it’s crucial to get the right message, sound and light in place before you start rolling.
<h3>2. Digital Marketing</h3>
The last time someone in our office used a phone book was to get to the last Sweet’N Low packet on a hard-to-reach shelf. And we would venture to say the same is true for many of our clients (unless they prefer Splenda). More often than not, consumers are looking online to gather information and pricing for the products or services they need. Therefore, companies will need to move their rates, discount packages, services, and offerings where their customers are looking for it: online.

In addition to making it easier for your customers to include you in their budget for the upcoming year, it’s also more important now than ever to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">include digital media in your own</a>. With new channels and capabilities being developed daily on the Internet, websites are becoming far more complex than the five-page, static HTML pages they once were. They’re incorporating instant messaging, applications, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a>, podcasting, gaming, blogs, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social networking</a>, and dynamically generated content pulled by an RSS feed from other sites. All of these separate initiatives are great to keep your audience coming back for more, but this year, business leaders will need to develop an overall digital marketing plan to play out how each initiative will work together to achieve their company’s greater goals.
<h3>3. Social Media</h3>
By now, even old-school business executives that were once hesitant about jumping into the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> pool are taking the plunge. It’s no longer a question of whether or not you have social media, but rather how you decide to utilize it, and whether or not those initiatives have resulted in an ROI. Offering free giveaways or coupons to people who “Like” you on Facebook is a great way to build your audience in the beginning stages. But after you get their attention, it’s just as important to keep it there. This will happen by engaging your customer through relevant—and frequent—posts, messages, photos, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">videos</a>, and other offerings. It’s also important to include a call-to-action in order to drive traffic where you want it to go, such as sharing a link to a new product or service featured on your company <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a>. This year, expect to see more in the realm of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">Social Listening Research</a> and Influencer Marketing, which allow you to analyze your target audience members to better understand your customers and their needs.

<a href=""http://linkedin.com"">LinkedIn</a>, a professional networking website, will also continue to be a social media platform to watch in 2011, with more than 12 million small-business leaders on its site, according to its blog last year. It’s become a huge resource for finding a job, finding a job candidate or making a connection with a potential business partner.
<h3>4. Multi-channel and Integrated Marketing</h3>
It’s great to market your company across different mediums, from online, print and broadcast to mobile applications and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media platforms</a>. But if the vehicles you’re using to promote your brand don’t cross promote one another, you’re missing out on a lot of business opportunities you could have had if they did. For example, this can take the form of a billboard with a QR code (barcode readable by dedicated QR barcode readers and camera phones), <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print advertising</a> with a mobile phone SMS call to action, or a link on a company website that redirects to its Facebook page to “Like” them. It should always come full circle. You want to engage your audience to interact with you and your brand, not just hit them once with a well-designed piece that leaves them thinking, “OK great, but now what?”

It simply isn’t enough to just do a newspaper advertisement or buy a radio spot anymore. It must be integrated into multiple platforms and, consequentially, be strongly branded to your company on those platforms. This will change the role of your audience members from recipients to participants.
<h3>5. Personalized Marketing</h3>
You may have already noticed this on <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a>, but in 2011, expect to see more websites with personalization capabilities. This means that if you frequently visit a website, it will track the keywords you search for and post and store this information in its database to customize what’s displayed on the site the next time you visit. It not only determines what’s displayed based on the keywords you search, but also by the pages you visit within the site and, for first time visitors, even the referring URL that linked you to the site.

With the astronomical growth of <a href=""http://groupon.com"">Groupon </a>and <a href=""http://livingsocial.com"">LivingSocial</a> in the past two years, smart startup companies are starting to use geo-location capabilities to drive foot traffic to their local businesses. This acceleration would largely be driven by discovery via location-based social experience sharing. The explosive growth of Instagram is also an early sign of this experience-sharing trend, and we will witness a whole lot more in the coming year.
<h3>6. Print</h3>
This just in: print is not dead. Print has reinvented itself more times than Cher and Madonna combined and, like their careers, it thrives by changing its look to stay relevant. In an “all-about-me” marketplace, printers have learned that in order to stay in touch with consumers, they have to get personal. Literally. Data-driven print (also known as 1:1 printing, variable data or personalized printing) is continuously growing in popularity and often involves strategically placing a customer’s name onto an already printed piece.

For example, vacation timeshares may put a customer’s name on the back of a white robe hanging in the closet of a bedroom. A sports clothing brand might put a customer’s name on the back of a football jersey. The options are endless, and it’s a great way to get creative and grab your audience members’ attention by reaching out to them by name.
<h3>7. SEO</h3>
Ah, the ever-elusive concept of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">Search Engine Optimization</a>. In recent years, the most common question we get from clients is hands down, “What can we do to become No. 1 in Google’s search results?” This isn’t surprising to us since your customers, like you, are probably using search engines as their primary means to find the information they are looking for. But the answer is much more complex than the reason behind the question. Although there are definitely ways that marketing professionals can help improve your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> through keywords, tags and content, there is no silver bullet for getting the No. 1 spot. With the introduction of new search engines such as Bing in the U.S., Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia, Google’s not the only player in the search engine game anymore. In addition, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media platforms</a> such as Facebook and Twitter are also becoming popular resources for searching, making it even more difficult to solve the equation to get to the No. 1 spot. In 2011, look for things to get even more complex as search engines advance, mobile phone searches get thrown into the mix and geo-location searches also become a factor in where you fall in search result listings.

Even if there isn’t a foolproof formula to guarantee your ranking, there are certainly ways to improve your SEO. Marketing experts have conducted plenty of research in this realm and can advise you of small things you can do to make a big impact in the long run.

<strong>In conclusion, the key to a successful year in marketing will be to engage your audience, be strategic in your initiatives, customize your offerings and keep your overall goal in mind. But if all else fails, post a really funny video of your cat sneezing on YouTube and watch the TV interviews, book deals, magazine covers, and sports drink sponsorships just roll in.</strong>

"It's here, Honeysuckle: A bright idea for Pantone in 2011","For those who saw The Devil Wears Prada (c’mon boys, you know you loved it), believe Miranda Priestly when she tells Andy:

“That sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s actually Cerulean … That blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.”

In 2000, <a href=""http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/index.aspx"">Pantone LLC</a>, the world’s leading color authority, decided Cerulean would be the color of the year. It made its way through fashion shows, interior decorations and graphic designs. No doubt, we caught a glimpse of Cerulean every day in the year 2000, whether in passing on a billboard, in the Target Home Furnishings section, or in Macy’s clothing department. Pantone’s Color of the Year affects our daily lives. Ms. Priestly was right (she just forgot to mention that Pantone plays an influential role in the colors designers incorporate into their pieces), so why not embrace it?

Over the past 10 years, Pantone has chosen colors like Fuchsia Rose (2001), Aqua Sky (2003) and Sand Dollar (2006) as the colors of the years—each varying in only pinks, blues and yellows, oddly enough. So it comes as no surprise that 2011’s choice is none other than the vibrant, rosy-colored Honeysuckle. That’s right, we said rosy. We thought Honeysuckle was an orangey-yellow, too.

According to Pantone, Honeysuckle’s dynamic red and pink tones encourage us to push beyond the escape and “meet the exhaustive challenges that have become part of [our] everyday lives.” It’s vibrant and uplifting, sure to bring confidence and liveliness back into our world; and it’s about time. Get ready to see Honeysuckle in weddings, bedspreads, commercials and so much more. Pops of this playful pink are about to start showing up everywhere, so how are you going to utilize it?

Color can affect us both physically and emotionally, according to Kate Smith from Sensationalcolor.com. Vibrant pinks like Honeysuckle can increase blood pressure and encourage action and confidence. It’s the color of happiness, often reminding women of the lightheartedness of their youth, according to TK person. We see pink as an international symbol of hope in the fight against breast cancer. But it’s not just a feminine color. The Japanese associate the color with masculinity, symbolizing fallen Samurai of the past in the annual blooming of the cherry blossom trees. Any chance you’re craving sweets after all this pink talk? It’s been said to do that too.

"The Myth of the Page Fold, and what you need to know","<strong>What is the fold?</strong> This is a reference to the upper half, or above the fold, of the front page of a newspaper which is considered to be premium space.<!--more--> It’s also commonly used to describe the area you see on a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">Web page</a> before you have to scroll down the page.

In the early days of the Web, most users were unfamiliar with page scrolling. However, the fact is people learned to scroll a long time ago. But still the ""everything needs to be above the fold"" myth lingers on.

The myth-busting team at Covenant is happy to set the record straight.

This myth regarding below 700 pixels (the page fold) has been debunked by evidence from user testing. 76% of users scroll! This according to Click Tail Scrolling Research Report (2007) which measured the activity of 120,000 page views.

ClickTail.com

There’s quite a bit of science used in evaluating how people view websites. In a 2009 study, CX Partners published findings from user testing over a 6 year period and over 800 user testing sessions. Their click and eye tracking showed not only that people’s eyes flick to the scroll bar to help them assess whether there is more content to be explored, but also that content below the fold is accessed just as much as that above.

The heatmap below is from CX Partners’ eye tracking software showing that users nearly always spend some time glancing at the scrollbar to judge page size.

A quick snoop around the Web will show you that successful brands are not worrying about the fold. Our advice: You shouldn’t be worried about the fold either.

At Covenant, we believe good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">Web design</a> gives your users some visual breathing room. Compelling content leads your users to read to the very end.

"Ben & Jerry's Twitter Treats, promotion in a creative way","Most Twitter users hardly ever use all of the allotted 140 characters they’re allowed to tweet. Ben &amp; Jerry’s decided to utilize this fact to promote a witty campaign called Fair Tweets (see the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX7busQUJo0&amp;feature=player_embedded"">video splainer</a> - a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> favorite), not only for its company, but also for a good cause.

On May 14, in honor of <a href=""http://www.worldfairtradeday10.org/index.php"">World Fair Trade Day</a>, Ben &amp; Jerry’s asked Twitter users to donate their spare characters to raise awareness of Fair Trade. They created a user-friendly <a href=""http://fairtweets.archive.stinkdigital.com/"">application</a> that allows people to type tweet whatever they'd like and automatically fills in the remaining unused characters with a Fair Trade message and hyperlink. So, if your tweet is only 20 characters, Ben &amp; Jerry’s will immediately fill in a 120-character message about Fair Trade for you … and they might even throw in a link or hashtag too.

Once your message is created, you simply click the “Tweet It!” button, and your Fair Trade message is sent off to Twitter for all of your followers to see. It takes two seconds (depending on your typing skills), and spreads awareness for Fair Trade around the world. Not to mention, it leads people to Ben &amp; Jerry’s as well. Promoting a cause through your company is always admirable, but Ben &amp; Jerry’s showed us how to make it clever and fun too. We think they deserve two thumbs up for promoting themselves and a good cause in a cool, non-garish sort of way. Don’t you?

First Class Seats to the Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Launch,"The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Team excitedly ran to the corner of Summerlin and Washington this morning to watch the space shuttle Endeavor’s last launch, only to be blinded by the sun glaring through a thick blanket of clouds.

As we returned to the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> house feeling a bit defeated, @StefMara was flying thousands of feet above us and had a VIP view of the launch. With ninja-like reflexes, she whipped out her phone and caught this momentous event on camera. And thanks to social networks like Twitter, we were able to share in her priceless experience.

Social networks are not only changing the way people socialize and receive news, but also, in this case, how they share out-of-this-world experiences.

"Juliet said it best, ""what's in a name?"" Well, there is a lot","I don’t know about you, but here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> <strong>we’re pretty glad the rapture didn’t happen.</strong> For the past few months we’ve been immersed in the rebranding process, and it’s finally paid off. We’d like at least a few months to enjoy the fruits of our labor. October should be just fine.<!--more-->

In all seriousness though, if you’re looking for a good team-building exercise for your company, I recommend rebranding. It’s cool to see an office come together to work on one project with goals and excitement and anticipation. I think we have an even greater appreciation for one another now that we’ve had to help and encourage each other towards one goal. Each person’s role was vital for fueling this process.

It all started with our name. You wouldn’t believe how many ideas we had. Each of us had to come up with three possibilities to put on our conference room whiteboard. Then, we took a vote and crossed out the ones we disliked—old school, red pen style. After days and days of filtering, the executive decision was made on “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative.” It was fun and quirky, but it also got our point across: we have a “big eye” for creativity and the ability to see the bigger picture.

Of course we had to go through all of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copyrighting</a> and legal processing, but with our name finally set in stone, we began brainstorming design concepts. Our genius graphic designers created a page-full of mascot ideas, but the majority of the house fell in love with Biggie. Colors, fonts, styles and an overall feel for our new site was made. And with that, the rest of us quickly got to work on copywriting, editing and formatting the pages to come.

Our efforts weren’t limited to our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a>, though. We gave our house a little bit of a face-lift, with some fresh landscaping, a couple of Adirondack chairs, and a new orange awning to incorporate our colors. We’d love a visit if you haven’t seen it yet.

So much more goes into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">rebranding</a> than I ever knew. It’s been an incredible experience to take part in, especially as an intern. We sort of took a walk in our clients’ shoes (not literally, don’t worry) and felt the excitement of secretly planning and working together to create something new and altering. <strong>The best part is that we get to continue helping others enjoy this process as well.</strong>

"My BIG Break At The Coolest Place To Work, BIGEYE","Many people say to cherish your college years because it’s the best four years of your life. Without a doubt, my experience at Florida State University was jam-packed with unforgettable experiences, new endeavors, embarrassing moments and of course, tons of new skills and knowledge.

But was that enough? Nope, not for me. I was ready to take on the professional world and start my career, but after tons of sent resumes and uninspiring interviews I felt a little helpless. That is, until I found an opportunity through my big sister from my sorority, Nicole, new employee/previous intern at Covenant Communications. I researched the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando advertising agency</a> and found that it was straight up my alley and something I wanted to pursue. After I met with Justin, and after Nicole put in a few good words, I was offered the internship.

That brings me to today. After a couple weeks as an intern I’ve had quite a unique experience and I already find myself at home, literally (the office is a converted house). Because we are in downtown Orlando, a prime location for pedestrians to stroll around Lake Eola, we see many random activities outside of the office. From people walking on stilts, to a lady walking around with a hula hoop around her waist, we just never know what the next day’s entertainment will be. Aside from the strange activities and sightings we see on pretty much a day-to-day basis, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative has been a rewarding place to work. The team has been more than welcoming. As a close-knit group, we get to know each other during office lunch dates, shuttle launches (well, sort of) and whatever reason we think of to have a celebration.

Since Covenant Communications was in the final stages of re-branding to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative when I came onboard, I immediately started working on proofing website copy and creating developer documents. Soon enough it was D-day. I helped Nicole set up the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> launch party. The “step and repeat” was a hit, the catered lunch was delicious and Biggie caught almost every pedestrian’s eye. All we needed was a red carpet and people would have thought we were premiering a movie.

I also had the chance to meet several clients during my time here, and I’ve noticed the great relationships we have with them. This close rapport and one-of-a-kind work environment makes this internship a ten out of ten, and it’s only the third week.

So, shout-out to Nicole! As my BIG, you always have your EYE on my best interests. I’m excited to be a part of the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative and I’m ready to learn more.

Don’t ‘Like’ Facebook? Well maybe this will change you mind,"If you’re tired of reading your friend Amy’s thousandth status update about her son’s potty training progress, you’re not alone. But Facebook is about so much more than TMI status updates, how many “friends” you have and photos of college kids making bad choices. Eighty percent of ComScore’s U.S. Top 100 Websites have established a strong company presence for their brands on Facebook. Here are a few reasons why you should too.

Let’s start off with the obvious: it’s a marketing tool to <strong>more than half a billion </strong>people. According to <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics"">Facebook</a>, 50 percent of its active users log on to the site every day. Digitalbuzz <a href=""http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/facebook-statistics-facts-figures-for-2010/"">Blog</a> found that more than 1.5 million local businesses have their own Facebook pages, and more than 20 million people become fans of pages each day. In fact, the average user becomes a fan of at least four pages and writes about <strong>25 comments each month.</strong> Furthermore, those who use Facebook on their mobile devices are twice as active as non-mobile users. And we all know how many smart phones are out there nowadays. Facebook has clearly proven itself to be the prime location to get people discussing and checking out businesses around the world. So what are you waiting for? It’s time to get more people talking about you. The public is interested in you and likes to be heard, but it’s your job to show them you’re listening.

Which brings us to reason No. 2: Facebook allows people to get engaged in your company. Every time you post an update, comment on someone else’s post or “like” a comment, you’re showing your audience that they’re important to you and reminding them you’re there. Encourage your fans to tag themselves in your photos, create contests for them to participate in (such as fun trivia), or reward them for “checking in” to your company. The more fans you can get, the higher Search Engine Optimization (<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>) you receive for your name. And yes, for those keeping count, that’s reason No. 3.

If you have a Facebook page, it automatically gets indexed on Google, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">increasing your SEO</a>. By including all of your information under the “Info” tab on your Facebook page (city, state, address and zip code, etc.), you’ll optimize local searches on the Internet. In the same regard, all of the information inserted in the Company Overview, Description and Mission fields will optimize your company name in product searches. You can add as many keywords dealing with your business as possible to heighten your SEO. This is done by captioning your photos and videos, adding descriptions to your event postings and allowing a discussion forum. If you pack everything you can with those key phrases, all of that information will be made available on search engines. The more your fans are involved in your page, the higher your SEO becomes. It’s basically like telling Google you’re pretty important.

But it doesn’t stop there. (Are you ready? You’re going to really like this one.) When used correctly and frequently, Facebook has been proven to increase businesses’ ROI. Take Lance Armstrong’s <a href=""http://www.livestrong.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LIVESTRONG</a> organization for example. According to <a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-livestrong-raised-millions-to-fight-cancer-using-social-media/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Social Media Examiner</a>, LIVESTRONG appointed a full-time social media employee in 2009 and raised a record-breaking $10.8 million for their charity — even with the troubled economy. In fact, more than 60 percent of LIVESTRONG’s website traffic is due to its social networking sites.

So be proactive and use this marketing technique to your advantage. We’d love to help. Whether it’s incorporating your branding into your Facebook, YouTube or Twitter page design, maintaining your status updates, or developing a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media campaign</a>, we love this stuff.

Disposable to Uploadable: The digital world take over,"Let’s think back to the days of disposable cameras and film rolls. In order to develop pictures we had to drive to the local convenient store or supermarket. After the pictures were developed, we would discover only half the batch of pictures were decent enough to keep. Finally, we would bring them home to cut and paste (no Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V functions allowed) to our favorite scrapbook or photo album. Sound exhausting? Maybe that’s because we’ve gotten used to the instant gratification of digital and mobile photography.

Ever heard of the term “mupload?” You won’t find this term in any ordinary dictionary. It was created by the online social world, meaning “mobile upload.” A simple click of a button on a mobile camera phone and your photo is instantly uploaded to the internet.

There are a ton of apps that have jumped on the mupload bandwagon. <a href=""http://instagr.am/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Instagram</a> is one such app and it allows iPhone users to remotely upload, edit and share their photographs on social networks. Your friends, your family, the world, the online community or whomever you chose can see what you see at almost that exact moment. The internet is now your favorite scrapbook and you can cut and paste your pictures <em>digitally</em> to create a personalized portfolio of your memories as they happen.

So where does your instant artwork go? Online image and video hosting websites hold your photos on giant servers, commonly referred to as the elusive “cloud.” These websites then allow you to create your customized account to archive your gallery of memories. Flickr, <a href=""http://twitter.com/bigeyecreative"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://facebook.com/BIGEYEagency"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Facebook</a> are just a few of the leaders in the online image industry.

The world of photography is changing. Businesses are now utilizing these websites to connect with their target markets, share photos, events and memories, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">build brand personality</a> and increase <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a>.

Want an example? Check out what the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE team</a> is up to on our Flickr, <a href=""http://twitter.com/bigeyecreative"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://facebook.com/BIGEYEagency"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Facebook</a>.

Learn how the updated AP Stylebook gets social in todays terms,"The highly esteemed Associated Press Stylebook, also known as the “Journalist’s Bible,” has recently inducted “unfollow,” “retweet,” “tagging,” and 18 other social media terms into its newly revised 2011 print edition. Surprised? We’re not. Over the past several years, new connotations of such words have emerged through social networking sites, and have moseyed their way into day-to-day dialogues.

Language is extremely fluid, changing and adapting to current culture. A “wall” is no longer just a structure that ensures <em>personal </em>space; it’s now a <em>public </em>space where “friends” can post comments, videos and pictures.

Created in 1953, the AP Stylebook has been a very prestigious source of information for more than 50 years. The fact that the AP editors think social media terms are worth publishing just goes to show the impact <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media platforms</a> have on the public.

Social media sites such as <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/BIGEYEagency"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/bigeyecreative"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Twitter </a>and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/bigeyecreative"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">YouTube</a> offer successful routes toward global communication, allowing you to essentially keep a public account of what’s happening in your world, and follow the lives of others. And it’s not just the younger generation that’s “tweeting,” but corporate companies and other professional organizations are as well. Company leaders are utilizing social media sites to increase exposure on the same platforms as their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a>. Even the AP Stylebook tweeted about the addition of these social media terms!

With technology continuously progressing and advancing, the digital world is becoming the most efficient way to do, well … just about everything! So, in the past, if you have been wary about engaging in the alternate universe we call social networking, don’t be afraid. Submerge yourself; you will be surprised at the endless possibilities available to you within just a few clicks.

Traditional agencies tactics verse Digital agencies,"In the advertising industry, we are now seeing a divide between traditional and digital agencies. And the people searching for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">creative advertising agencies</a> are left feeling like they need to pick a side. Do you stick with the conservative, traditional agency or try something different with a trendy, digital agency? <strong>This definite division between agencies and marketing philosophies leaves consumers stuck between two extremes.</strong>

On one side of the spectrum, you have traditional agencies that cling to what is safe and commonplace in marketing, such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print</a>, billboards, radio, newspaper, TV and direct mail. Some traditional agencies think along the lines of, “print isn’t going anywhere,” and “social media is just a phase.” Although overhead costs may be a bit of a burden, the vast visibility of these marketing mediums has been proven reliable and successful.

On the other side of the spectrum, you’ve got modern-day digital agencies pushing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">Web</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile apps</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, QR codes, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> and other non-traditional forms of advertising. These agencies live by the latest and greatest trends and stick with edgy, innovative marketing concepts. With a “print is dead” mentality, these agencies tend to focus on the next big thing on the marketing horizon.

Like most things in life, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">Print</a> is not dead and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> is not just a phase. It’s not about utilizing one or the other. It’s about integrating these mediums together. Weave your social media platforms into your print pieces, and vice versa. Your billboard’s call to action can be to visit your robust website for more information. And your business cards can don a QR code that links to an innovative video explaining your company’s philosophy. These types of collaborative marketing initiatives can work together to provide greater <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a> and, ultimately, ROI.
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When shopping for an agency, make sure you find one that sees the big marketing picture. <strong>You shouldn’t have to pick a side.

"Landing the job in the real world, words from a BIGEYE intern","Congratulations! You’ve earned your bachelor’s degree and you’re now ready for the next chapter in your life. Welcome to the job market that’s only a little less horrible then the one from last year. The transition from college to work may be one of the hardest tasks you face in 2011. If you feel completely lost and you are still unemployed, don’t worry, you’re not alone. You may find yourself moving back into your parents’ house for a while before you earn enough money to get on your feet. Although it may sound dreadful, it’s probably a smart move.

So what’s the next step? Design a plan and get organized! Invest your time in finding work, any kind of work. A great way to gain experience in your desired field, especially as an entry-level job seeker, is an internship.

You’ve heard it all before. “It’s a great way to get your foot in the door.” “It’s a good stepping stone.” Sound familiar? You may be thinking, “blah, blah, blah,” as it goes in one ear and out the other. Back up a little, and re-think. An internship may be the key to landing a future job or may lead to other potential opportunities. Although some internships may not include compensation, you can definitely look forward to gaining valuable and relevant skills needed for a real job.

Today’s world is all about connections and networking. Of course, some types of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a> such as LinkedIn and Facebook can be beneficial networking tools, but there is nothing like getting out in the real, non-virtual world and getting noticed.

Set yourself apart from the rest of the job seekers through your resume. Employers will receive tons of resumes that list a bachelor’s degree or a job at the local Cold Stone Creamery. Illustrate what makes you different. An internship will show dedication to learning about the industry before becoming an employee.

If you have a relative in the business or found an amazing job through sheer luck, you are one of the very few. For those who are sick of the stressful economy you must gain motivation and take initiative in your career aspirations. Develop essential skills, boost your resume and gain networking contacts by starting an internship. You never know what you will learn or whom you will meet.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative offers a couple of internships in the marketing/advertising industry. No, you will not be fetching coffee for office employees. You will build important skills by working both independently and with a team on numerous creative projects while gaining essential office environment experience. Take it from a current <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> intern and job seeker. An internship will give you an advantage and the confidence needed to land that future job.

Ideas + Process = Unlimited Umbrella Drinks For Days,"A lot of people are enjoying a well-deserved summer vacation. The vacation you are enjoying probably started with the simple question: Where to go? Do you want an adventure experience or a more relaxing getaway? After a little location research, most of us dust off the calculator to match our budget to a location. Then we start to plan our vacation experience, making tour arrangements or restaurant reservations.

<strong>The bigger the vacation, the more planning it requires.</strong>

While we all want to get to the fun part (really, who doesn’t love an umbrella drink poolside?), it’s all the work you’ve done before departure that makes the vacation so much fun.

Much like a summer vacation, the creative process is a whole lot of fun. But behind every <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">marketing campaign</a> is a thoughtful creative process. This process digs into the weeds of your marketing needs, and it is what turns a great design into a powerful marketing tool.

For example, a logo advances your company by supporting desired perceptions. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">Brand identity</a> expresses itself in every touch point of the brand, and becomes intrinsic to your company’s culture and a constant symbol.

Wow! That brings into perspective why branding requires a disciplined process. Admittedly, it does take some patience to complete a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo design</a> questionnaire (yes, every question) and spend time in conversation about the nuances of your product/company. Clarifying brand strategy through a full discovery makes it possible to design a logo that frequently appears in a space of about 1 ½” x ½” to represent your brand.

Sometimes the excitement of the creative process can overwhelm one’s patience for the process. It really <em>is</em> important for you to compile all your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo design</a> feedback into one document. This step brings your focus away from the individual elements and back to the big picture. Your feedback written down into one document also gives your team a chance to make sure everyone is on the same page. Our designers will use your specific direction to move your logo through several rounds of revisions until the final concept is achieved.

With this perspective, you can see this outcome, your company logo, is worthy of a thoughtful and intentional creative journey.

Sandra's BIG Debut as a member of the BIGEYE team.,"Something I have always found interesting is the thought of the unknown. Where will I end up living? In which direction will my career path take me? <strong>Is Lady Gaga really going to be the Madonna of today’s youth?</strong>

I can honestly say when I set out to enter this ‘real world’ of jobs, bills and florescent office lighting I never anticipated I’d be working in a house, in my favorite part of Orlando, for a company with a mascot named “Biggie” (and a cute one at that). I can also say that at a week and a half in at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE Creative</a>, I have never felt so at home in a work environment. I come from a world of lights, camera, action … literally. As my college years came to a close, I was dead set on exploring the beast that is broadcast television. Not necessarily in front of the camera (alright, I can admit when I was younger I had aspirations of being the next big meteorologist), but the thing that interested me was what made them tick, what was the lifeblood behind these major television networks.

Enter the world of advertising.

My time with Orlando NBC affiliate, WESH 2, opened my eyes to the world of everything ads. It is advertising that is absolutely an integral part of a stations’ success. This is a part of what the fundamentals of television entail. As I dove head first into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">developing marketing campaigns</a> for a variety of clients and industries, I found myself more and more captivated by the ever-changing nature of this industry, and how not only television, but radio, print, outdoor, web and now social media, without a doubt could (and would) help businesses grow. What I found to be even more fascinating was in five years, I had seen the map of advertising drastically change. I could have never dreamt when I joined Facebook as a college Junior it would one day be an essential tier to business’ branding and marketing initiatives. <strong>It is this change and diversity in our advertising mediums that truly excites me about this business, and from a creative standpoint, the sky really is the limit. </strong>

I squeezed every bit of knowledge I could from my experience at WESH, and found where my passion truly lied – the creative development process and the relationships with clients. In my short time with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, I’ve seen first hand that those two aspects are also part of their success and passion…and what we have is a match made in heaven. Advertising, marketing and branding has been in existence for more than a century. It is the mediums that continue, and will continue, to shape the way this industry develops. I am ecstatic to not only be a part of a team that shares this enthusiasm for the industry, but one that offers free lemonade to passers-by on the front lawn.

Advantages of using social media to promote your business,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">Social media</a> is generally used to describe interactive communication and dialogue that is common to the internet today. This is sometimes referred to as web 2.0 and at the heart of this is what is known as user generated content. It included software and tools that allow users to create and share content among each other and this power of interaction can be sourced by entrepreneurs to promote their businesses.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/social-media-influencer-marketing"">Social media</a> includes the use of internet forums, weblogs, blogs, micro blogging, podcasts, video diffusion, social bookmarking and site rating.

One of the advantages of using social media to promote your business is that it is relatively inexpensive and easier to use than traditional promotional media such as newspapers, television and radio. Therefore anyone with any level of expertise can use social media for self promotion and advertising agencies that do internet marketing are also able to use this to their advantage. Here are a few reasons why it's so advantageous to use social media to promote your business:
<h3>Increasing and improving website traffic</h3>
Everyone that is interested in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">building a website</a> for selling ideas or products knows that the greater the traffic to your website, the greater the chances you have of making a sale and once a customer is satisfied with the service on your site, the greater chance he has of coming again for the same product or another, and the greater the chance of recommending your sites to peers through social media.

[quote]You can also serve your company by including <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">links in your social media</a> posts and by sending information about your site to your network of friends that becomes propagated through the process.[/quote]
<h3>Creating space for your business</h3>
In order for your business to be recognized in its niche, you have to do marketing by spreading the information around and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> is one of the interesting ways for creating buzz about your business. Social media will permit you to build a following, and send your name about which will enable you to create a name or brand recognition.
<h3>Social media can help you engage with customers in an entirely new way</h3>
Using social media can enable you to get personal with your clients. This can create customer loyalty especially if you are there to participate in discussions, offer your opinions and regularly answer questions. Just like in normal day to day business interactions where we tend to go to the shop where the owner engages us in conversation and become friends with us, so too your customers will keep coming for more.
<h3>Social media can help boost sales</h3>
Social media has been known to return in sales, and has been one of the driving forces in internet marketing. By connecting with your peers and diffusing information and new product information, these links create interest and thus generates sales.
<h3>Social media can help with image management</h3>
Every business man takes care of his image and the company's image and rumors have been known to destroy businesses. However with social media, you are able to keep on top and know about changes in your reputation as well as reply quickly and work to change the destructive comments and rumors.
<h3>Social media can help with marketing research</h3>
You can use social media to conduct <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">marketing research</a>. You can encourage people in your network to offer reviews as well as just influence the comments in a particular direction to see what your competition is doing or which product or service is hot at the moment. This can help you plan for future services and product releases.
<h3>Cost effective marketing with social media</h3>
Social media is cheaper to learn, source and use and therefore it can be very effective when used and a few minutes of your day concentrated to this activity can produce a great deal of returns for you in the long run.

It is important to establish from the outset what you want to achieve from engaging in social media. This way you can easily see whether social media provides you with a return on the investment of your time. Keep measuring your success against your goals. If something isn't working then don't be afraid to change it or try another type of social media.

Alternative marketing strategies,"The average person has five <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media accounts</a>, and if we told you how much time they spent on each one, you probably wouldn’t believe us. It’s time to create some unique methods for reaching new customers that your company has probably never used before. Into the world of alternative marketing we go!

The growth of the internet and the way it has become integrated in daily life means that it can be creatively sourced as a marketing tool and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency"">e-marketing</a> has developed from this as an important alternative strategy. The attractiveness of online marketing is that it is cost effective and makes it much easier to target a specific group with a certain marketing pitch.

Going online has a lot of intrinsic advantages also. Most of it is related to the web design ideas that you choose to integrate in your site, be it an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce</a> site or an informational website. If your website is expertly designed and developed to be beautiful, user-friendly and with well thought-out and targeted keywords, you may benefit from web marketing strategies without paying any one. Regularly updating your site and creating links to other sites, as well as encouraging inbound links, is a cost- and time-efficient tactic that can help bring traffic and ultimately result in increased sales.

Some of today’s most effective alternative <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/social-media-influencer-marketing/social-media-strategy"">marketing strategies</a> involves the use of social media. With social media, you can join existing communities or create new communities and in turn a brand following, offering products to people on a relational basis. For example, Snap Inc., Snapchat’s parent company, had the largest IPO since 2014, with a market evaluation of $24 billion. That being said, investors aren’t the only ones keeping a close eye on the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media platform</a>—marketers are, too. Here you are able to communicate with clients in a whole new way, and offer your products in an informal atmosphere. When used properly, social marketing doesn’t even look like marketing at all.

Characteristics of a Great Website,"If you hit a search term and come up with websites dealing with the same subject, it is certain that some will attract your attention than others, even when they may all carry the same content. If you are a user, you can switch until you find a site that can quickly give you what you want. However if you are a web designer, you will want to produce a website that will attract and keep your visitors engaged. [quote] The trick is to get users attracted with great web design as well as with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">engaging content.</a> [/quote]

Formula for a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/website-design-development"">Great Website</a>:
<h3>Create Original Content</h3>
Besides the obvious problems of plagiarism, making sure that your content is well written, appropriately presented and unique will give your readers something to always come for. It is common to see sites that just spread the information around, or just throw keywords for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> purposes without making much sense. Try to make give value to your visitors by presenting carefully thought out text to attract and keep them coming for more quality information.
<h3>Design for your Target Audience</h3>
Keep your target audience in mind. You cannot design for the whole world, of course you can but if you are trying to sell a product or service, you will want to target a particular niche and keep that niche population in mind when you create your site. You have to think about them, put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself if you were of the target population would you like your site.

Create a simple but creative and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">professional design</a>. You might have come across sites whose webmasters have included all the tips and tricks of web design that they have learned to get and keep visitors. This is counterproductive as it reduces the value of the site. What is more the user gets confused with too much elements and you may find them avoiding your site instead. Therefore choose your design and follow through to the end. If it doesn't work then change, reinvent and give your site a facelift.
<h3>Work on your Navigation</h3>
One of the important characteristics of a good website is the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/website-design-development/responsive-web-design"">navigation</a>. Great navigation lets users see where they are on your site, and also lets them know how to move about. Use creative techniques, text and symbols to help visitors navigate your site. Chances are when a person needs to look for information on the subjects that you deal with, they will likely come to your site, and also keep coming for more as they can find what they want, and they can also reference and cross reference with ease.

&nbsp;
<h3>Design for Speed</h3>
Make sure that your site is easy to load on the browsers. Limit the graphic elements or optimize them for speed. If your site takes too long to load, it may be frustrating and users may tend to avoid your site.

&nbsp;
<h3>Optimize your site for search engines</h3>
Good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">SEO</a> techniques will enable your site to be indexed and found. Do not use keyword stuffing or other guerrilla tactics to get your site indexed and ranked. Use keywords so that they blend naturally into your web content and you will be on the way to attracting and keeping great clients.
<h3>A Good Website should have Functional and Reciprocal links</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Create good content</a>, but support them with great links for further information that that they may find your site an excellent resource. Moreover these links should regularly be checked to know if they are not dead links. Dead links should be checked, removed and replaced.

A good website regularly has information updated. They will keep information fresh so users can benefit from fresh content. You can use feeds to let users know when content is updated and also employ social marketing skills to make people know that your site is up, running and improving daily.

Characteristics of Great Web Design,"The internet plays a great role in the information transfer today and one of the major ways through which information is shared is through websites. There are many different kinds of websites, some just for information, some for games and others for commercial activity.

No matter what the purpose of the site is, it needs to be carefully researched and designed in order for the website to meet its objectives and satisfy users. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida web design agency</a> can help.

Some of the characteristics of great web design include:
<h3>Simple and Intuitive Layout</h3>
Simple designs pay off because it offers fewer distractions to the visitor. There is a gradual shift towards designs that feature just one or two columns and they make it easier for the visitor to find what they are looking for.
<h3>Centered Orientation</h3>
Today there is a gradual shift towards websites that use a centered orientation as research has proven that the eye is more likely to catch the contents at the top centre than at the bottom and so building your site in his way will ensure that your content becomes easily noticed.
<h3>Content is King</h3>
As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">web design</a> ethics become more developed, there is a gradual shift from the shell and the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/website-design-development/user-experience-design"">general design</a> of the site to the content. The first few years of web design concentrated on construction of the total site, background and graphics and usually the content was left for others to deal with. However today, more attention is placed on the content and care is taken to match the content with the overall message. In general great and regularly <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">updated content</a> will the battle against a well polished site with not much content.

This trend can be seen in the move from regularly structured sites and strict layouts to freer less regular layouts. The colors in the background are usually muted and the use of effects is kept to the strict minimum so that the user can <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">focus on the contents</a>.

There is a trend towards neutral to plain background against which captivating headlines can be placed to draw attention to the important parts of the page. However it should be used sparingly and the colors should only be used to navigate the user to important parts of the website.

Therefore the trend is not to use too many attractive elements on one page.
<h3>Plenty of Whitespace</h3>
The best way to describe the of this white space is to contrast it with sites that have a profusion of text and graphics filling the whole page, not leaving any place to rest the eyes.

A good deal of white space gives the eyes a place to rest, allowing for maximum focus when you get to read the contents of the page.
<h3>Make your Site Easy to Navigate and Use</h3>
Have you ever gone to a site where you are unable to find your way around, or to retrace your steps? I have seen my share of sites that just has no way of telling you where you are. It is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">intelligent design</a> to show your visitors where they are by leaving little signs and navigation marks in each page. This quickly helps them to find their way around.

Moreover, make sure that your site can work on more than one type of browser. Think of your clients and what they might be using and try to make sure that your site can work on these browsers.
<h3>Use Relevant Graphics</h3>
Graphics can be used to make your site more interesting. Good web graphic design can be used, but they must be used sparingly and must be relevant to the content. Placing irrelevant graphics will only serve to confuse the surfer.

A well designed website is one of the best tools of making your company known and for building a great following of customers. Great design will also make sure that you stay relevant for web users worldwide.

How Marketing Helps Companies,"According to the <a href=""http://www.cim.co.uk"">Chartered Institute of Marketing</a>, marketing can be defined as the management process that identifies, anticipates and satisfies customer requirements profitably. With this definition, we can see that marketing is essential to the success of a company.

To take this a step further, we can say that marketing even begins before the production process as it helps the entrepreneur <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">identify</a> what the customer needs and also to see to it that the production meets the demands in quantity as well as in quality. It can also be said that it also involves the promotion of the products as well as the distribution.

Therefore all the strategies that a business uses to boost sales and improve profits can be described as marketing. To be precise, we can say that marketing is composed of Advertising, Sales, Building and maintaining customer relations and business development strategies. Therefore in order to understand how marketing helps companies, it is imperative to understand the part that each of these processes affect a company. We have seen this with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> and hope it helps you.
<h3>Sales</h3>
The end point of every economic activity is not only to make sure that the final product or service becomes available to the consumers, but that the consumers may buy, use it and then come back for more. The people that are in direct contact with the consumers are the salesmen, and getting a good sales strategy can do a lot to put a company far ahead on competition and help it make profits.
<h3>Advertising</h3>
Advertising is the process of making a brand known by giving information to people about the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand</a>, as well as by creating it a place in the society. Good advertising will usually end up creating a jingle, a color, a picture or a lifestyle that becomes associated with the product or service and will trigger a response of recognition from the consumer once these triggers are seen or heard, even before seeing the product. Great advertising has been known to improve the performance of many businesses, and the most successful companies and products are usually recognized as such.
<h3>Customer relations</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">Good customer relations</a> can set a company way above their competitors. This includes dealing with customers issues like follow up of orders as well as in answering their questions and calming their doubts. It may also have to do with troubleshooting with them to find solutions to problems they might have encountered in using your product or service.
<h3>Business development</h3>
The business development team identifies, proposes and overseas ideas that should help to give the company a bigger share in the market. They are usually concerned with product improvement and the creation of new products. The business development team usually studies the market, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">talk to customers to know what they need</a> and try to create products that satisfy them better.
<h3>Adjustments</h3>
Sometimes, even well thought out marketing strategies may not work, and the company will need to change its tactics in dealing with either the product or the market. Adjustment is a marketing strategy that tries to identify what is going wrong, and to make proposals for addressing the problem and proposing new strategies.

In order to profit from these strategies, companies need to use a marketing section of their company that will apply and integrate all these different sectors of marketing and help the company apply them or consult with an external marketing agency that will bring expert help to work with them on all these sectors to ensure that they meet <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">their target</a>, become profitable and grow.

How to Identify Different Types of Ad Agencies Right Away,"Advertising is one of the earliest concepts of human economic activity. This has developed with the coming of every new technology and continues to grow each day. Drawings, printing, telephone, television and more recently the internet and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media marketing</a> have all made their mark in the history of advertising, and who knows what tomorrow might bring.

Advertising can be done individually, or by the use of a marketing agency. Depending on the kind of product or service that you wish to market, and the population that you wish to meet in terms of the strata of the population as well as whether the population is local or if you are looking for a worldwide distribution, you will want an ad agency that is able to handle your proposal effectively as well as reach the target population.

You will also have to make this choice based on the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">advertising strategy</a> that you think is efficient for you and thus make sure that the agency you chose is specialized in this aspect of advertising.

[quote]Ad agencies are normally classified based on the media that they specialize in, and because of this classification, it is easy to see ad agencies that specialize in television ads, radio ads, newspaper ads and more recently web and new media ads. [/quote]

Marketing agencies are usually classified based on their scope. You might want to check if the agency serves a particular location as in a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando marketing agency</a> or if the agency is has a global network and therefore a wider reach.

However in marketing, the term “type of advertising” is used to describe the primary focus of the advertising message and it can be classified as:
<h3>Product-Oriented Advertising</h3>
<h3>Image Advertising</h3>
<h3>Advocacy Advertising</h3>
<h3>Public Service Advertising</h3>
Therefore we can infer from these that type of advertising agencies will also fall within these categories.
<h3>Product-Oriented advertising</h3>
A product can be an idea, a service or a good that is the result of a company's or a person’s activity. Product oriented advertising refers to advertising that is meant to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promote this product or service</a> to a particular audience. Here Ad agencies may use informative advertising to furnish information about the product; persuasive advertising where the approach is to try and convince people to buy, and comparative advertising that tries to show consumers how the product compares with others on the market.
<h3>Image advertising</h3>
Image advertising is the type of advertising that focuses on building up a company's image to make it more attractive among its peers. They use strategy that increases the importance of a company and as such do not focus on particular products. This strategy is usually used in cases where a company has taken on a new name due to mergers or change of ownership, or due to negative publicity a company may need to rebrand itself.
<h3>Advocacy Advertising</h3>
These are usually advertising efforts that use the company's public stance to voice certain opinions as concerns them or their future. In this way they companies can even sway public opinions on political issues and other debates that may affect them in one way or the other.
<h3>Public Service Advertising</h3>
These adverts are usually free of charge depending on the country and the policy of the agency that handles the advert. They are usually for the public good. It is important for nongovernmental organizations and humanitarian organizations to publicize themselves and to call for financial resources and personnel such as volunteers.

There are ad agencies that do not specialize in any one of these sectors, but embrace all the different sectors. There are also some that specialize in one or two of these and it will usually be to the advantage of the advertiser to choose the marketing agency whose profile is adapted to the kind of advertising he wishes to undertake.

How to market your advertising agency and who to target,"Advertising is all about making a product or service known and this service is usually accomplished by the individual himself or by a marketing agency. Having the passion and creative talent to build and manage an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/agency"">advertising agency</a> is one thing, however to stay in business; you have to learn how to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services"">market</a> your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/agency"">advertising agency</a> as well, not just your clients.

The first thing in marketing your business is to make sure that you plan and develop ways to reach your target audience, which is usually companies and businesses that will want to advertise their products or services by using your expertise in advertising. Though you will often <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">use networking</a> and different media such as radio, television and the internet, your efforts will usually work best if you create space for yourself in a particular advertising medium by specializing in one or two advertising media and by developing a presence in this area.

For example, if you are running an ad<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> agency in Orlando</a> or a marketing agency in Florida, you will want to focus primarily on businesses in Orlando. You can even narrow down your search to only radio networks, television networks or internet advertising depending on your expertise.

Your business needs to have a unique identity. You need to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">give it a name and a description</a> that sets it apart from other advertising agencies. You should try to describe yourself in a way that sets you apart as unique and professional, and communicate how advertising with you will bring more value to your customers just by adding themselves to your network. Be creative!

While in this process, you also have to identify who your potential client is and in doing so you will easily know where to locate them and engage with them either directly or indirectly to learn more about your business and to take interest in your offers.

For marketing efforts that are localized, as in the case of Orlando ad agencies as mentioned in the example above, localizing your marketing efforts does make sense. However if your company is looking to reach a worldwide audience, and also planning to go international, then you do not have to leave any avenues untouched. The larger you are able to spread your net, the greater the possibility of catching new business. You should be positioned to try satellite television, magazines, newspapers, radio, social media, and even other non-traditional media.

However, you will need to research each medium appropriately in order to find out where your target population is and then focus on this niche for maximum effect so you dowaste your resources.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Going online</a> can easily bring you to a worldwide audience, and to keep in touch, you will need to be constantly supplying keywords and new content. Spread your reaches by sharing in advertising networks where you can put your adverts on certain networks and pay a commission or post links and adverts on certain networks who in return will also post adverts on your site. You can also work through <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/social-media-influencer-marketing"">social media</a> platforms to create links and make new customers.

How to use viral marketing tactics to promote your brand,"Viral marketing (also sometimes described as marketing buzz, viral advertising, or buzzwords) can be defined as marketing techniques that use existing networks to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">spread awareness</a> of a particular brand or service and thus creating a process whereby the existing network is responsible for propagating the marketing message and this can take the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">form of video clips</a>, interactive games, adverts, eBooks, images or text messages.

[quote]The overall goal in creating a viral marketing strategy is to reach a wide audience in the shortest time possible and with as little expenditure as can be managed. [/quote]The message receivers are responsible for carrying the message across to other receivers and so the marketers try as much as possible to create a message that will appeal to their target group which should be people that have preferably a high social networking potential , making it more likely for the message to go across through the targeted medium to the target audience.

In order to use viral marketing successfully, you should be able to meet these three conditions:

- Identify the right messengers to propagate the message

- Create the right message

- Choose the medium to diffuse the message
<h3>Identify the Messenger</h3>
The messengers ideally are the people that are always looking for new things in an area. They actually specialize in this area or take it as a hobby. They could be bloggers or reviewers and will usually have a lot of following for their opinions.

Once they get the message and are happy with it, it gets transmitted to their immediate social network and thus gets propagated to friends of friends and when rightly done it might make the whole world within 24 hours. Imagine the impact it might have on the potential of a company to sell.
<h3>Creating the Message</h3>
Getting the right message, the right pitch is the key to viral marketing. The message should essentially be simple, easily memorable and should sell itself. This is the greatest part of the venture, and the right message will always find a way out. Sometimes it may take several attempts and slight changes to make it more effective and viral.
<h3>The Environment</h3>
The environment, the timing and the expectations of the public all play a vital role in the propagation of a message. It should resonate with the economic and political climate at the time. However unlikely messages have been known to take hold and spread, so you just have to pull your resources together and give it a go.

There are many strategies that you can adopt for effective viral marketing and learning how to use viral marketing for your business from time to time can establish you, give you a wider customer base and generate profits for your business.

Some of the elements you can include in your viral marketing strategy include:
<h3>Offering free products and services</h3>
Free services and products are usually very attractive and call for a lot of attention. Viral marketing usually uses the idea of offering services to individuals that propagate the message, usually if they are able to let the message reach a certain number of individuals, they are more likely to get a free product or service. Generally the free offer calls for attention to your free product, but it might also be a direct way of getting the person to explore other products and services on offer which might eventually convert to a sale.
<h3>Using Existing Social Networks</h3>
Without an existing network of peers to take up the message, a good message may remain in marketing dump and never see the light. Even if you don't have a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social network</a>, it will be essential to create one, link with people, leave messages on their message boards and participate in forums. Once you get this organized, it will be easier to get your message across to the first group of social network active people that are important for spreading the message across once they get fired up!
<h3>Prepare for the Expected Increase in Traffic</h3>
In order to successfully use viral marketing, you should be prepared for the increase in traffic, or in sales. Not being able to satisfy the curiosity of the people that have come into contact with your messages will spell failure on your part, and may even incur a backlash from the very socially active population that are first on the line. Therefore make sure that your equipment and staff are well able to handle the possible surge in business that may arise from the marketing effort.
<h3>Create Compelling Messages</h3>
Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/"">great design</a> and clever marketing to create a compelling message. Viral marketing is as much a psychological process as a marketing activity. Strive to understand what moves your niche population and you will be more likely successful at creating something that they can identify with, love and spread around.

Teamwork is an essential part in marketing communication,"Marketing can be defined as all the different activities that are involved in making products available to satisfy the needs of the customers, while at the same time generating profits for the manufacturers and distributors. It is a complex process and it involves the following:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/website-design-development/user-experience-design"">Designing </a>a product that meets customer specifications which many need the use of marketing research to determine what the customers needs.</li>
 	<li>Promoting the products so that people may get to know the product through <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing communications and Advertising</a>.</li>
 	<li>Setting the price and making the product available to the population through vending outlets.</li>
</ul>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">Marketing communications</a> can be described as the communication that is used in the promotion phase of the product. It is the communication between the marketing division or the marketing efforts of a company and the market and it is usually geared towards the promotion of the product. Marketing communication can usually be handled in-house, or can be sub contracted to a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/""><strong>marketing agency</strong></a>.

The people in the marketing communication sector that are involved with advertising, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">branding</a>, direct marketing to customers, graphic design of product and product containers, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaging</a>, sales and sales promotion.

They are generally involved with creating and delivering messages to the public in an attempt to move them to develop an affinity with the company and to buy the products of the company. They are usually known as marketing communicators, and it is more usual than not a team effort, than the work of a single individual.

This can either mean having a team of people to work in these different processes or taking on one marketing agency that does this, or coordinating the efforts of different specialized agencies like <strong>Graphic design agencies</strong>, Ad Agencies and market <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">research agencies</a>.

Marketing communication can be said to be divided into 5 stages from the time the message is conceived and delivered to the time the messages is received and then possible action taken by the receiver to change him from the receiver of a marketing message to a consumer.

The stages in the process are:
<ul>
 	<li>Sender - which represents the marketing team that delivers an idea to the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing communication</a> team</li>
 	<li>Encoding- represents the part of the process where the communicator takes the message and transforms it into eye catching or step changing visual adverts or tunes or a mixture of all as in audio visual ads</li>
 	<li>Transmission - which represents the stage where the messages are transmitted through radio, tv the internet and any other device chosen by the company</li>
 	<li>Decoding- represents the stage when the consumer receives the image and decodes it; usually it has to do with thinking in the pattern that the marketer wants them to think</li>
 	<li>Receiver-the message is now with the received by the target audience and the receiver can then make a decision to respond and buy, take the subscription or develop a way of thinking as desired.</li>
</ul>
Therefore, from the processes above it can be seen that teamwork is essential in marketing communication as the process will be almost impossible for a single individual to create and deliver successfully alone.

In general, the people who develop the ideas and strategies in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">marketing research</a> are usually analysts, and those that take the results of these ideas and recommendations to create a new product are usually different from those that will also use these same ideas to create advertising for the product.

[quote] Without a clear idea of what the company goals are, or the kind quality of the product and who they are trying to reach, marketing communicators will not be able to create and transmit a convincing message to the consumers. Therefore teamwork is very much essential to the success of any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">marketing campaign</a>. [/quote]

A marketing campaign team will usually involve people from account planning, account management, creative talent production, media departments and specialist in TV ads, radio ads, billboard advertisers as well as internet and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media advertisers</a>.

All these people need to be managed and they need to work with each other.  Without a collective team spirit, and coordination it will be a chaotic situation and so the marketing communication team has to work with coordinating these heads and assigning tasks to each individual so that the team works flawlessly and delivers the end products as required.

Good coordination of the team will usually lead to convincing messages being sent to the consumer which will ultimately end in making sales and to convert the receiver of the messages to a client.

There is Greater Potential of Becoming a Global Brand,"In <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional advertising</a>, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">advertising campaign</a> is usually limited to particular geographical regions or spaces. With the internet, the scope seems to be endless and a greater potential of becoming a global brand. If you are able to handle goods and supply them across the globe in a reasonable amount time, you are likely to have a customer from there. The reaches are almost without limits and are only limited by your own ability. The synchronization of payment methods through credit cards has made serving remote communities even easier.
<h3>Focused Internet Marketing</h3>
There is evidence to show that over 60% of people that buy an article or service online made some effort to search for the product or service beforehand. Therefore if you know the possible customer profile for your goods, you can target your advertising efforts to the sites that they are likely to visit. Creating your site with relevant keywords will make the site come up in targeted search by the users. Therefore the person that sees your product is possibly someone that is already interested in what you are offering and he will be more likely to convert.
<h3>Quicker Conversion Times</h3>
One of the greatest advantages to internet marketing is that the conversion time is far less than the conversion time for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">traditional advertising campaigns</a>. One of the reasons for this short conversion time is that it is easier for the user to react to the advertising message in internet advertising. Most of the time, the advertising itself is a link to the product page and a user is able to buy with a few clicks.
<h3>More Product Knowledge</h3>
With traditional advertising such as TV and Radio, there is not enough space to explain to the user what the good or service is really about and what advantages they might get from using the good or service. With internet advertising, the interested user can click on the advert, search for information about the good or service and then make up his mind whether to buy or not. It is easy to inform the client without the use of your own time and effort. More over the client can get enough information and buy without spending time in traffic to visit your store or depot as in a traditional setting.
<h3>More Cost Effective</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">Internet advertising</a> generally has lower entry level fees than traditional advertising methods. If you have the time and with some effort, there is a great deal that an entrepreneur can usually accomplish in terms of advertising without incurring costs.

You are able to restrict your advertising by a certain amount each day on advertising platforms which is a great thing for your budget. Moreover, there are some internet campaigns that will only charge you for activity. That is you won't be charged unless a user interacts with your advert in some way. This is a great value for each advertising dollar.
<h3>Good Conversion Tracking</h3>
One of the greatest advantages of internet marketing is that it offers conversion tracking. Therefore you can quickly know your target population and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">optimize your campaign</a> for these, or see where you are falling short and try to make your net wider.

These advantages show that internet marketing is certainly useful and it will increase profits and visibility for the budding entrepreneur - just is it will the accomplished businessman.

"BIGEYE's Fabulous Fall Graphic Design Intern, Alex!","OK, lets just get the boring stuff over with. My name's Alex, I'm 21 years old and currently a senior at the University of Central Florida - GO KNIGHTS! I think of myself as the ultimate Flordian, there’s nothing I love more about me than the fact that I’m a Florida gal. However, I did move to Massachusetts for a year when I was 18 to broaden my horizon and to gain a greater sense of independence. But I had to get out of there after just a year, I couldn’t handle living in a world of grey and gloomy overcast skies every day – like I said, Florida gal.

I've had the goal to make it in the vibrant world of advertising and work with a team of creative people for as long as I can remember. I’m pretty sure it stems from my passion for art. At the early age of five, I was already painting and drawing, or whatever you want to call it (considering they were done by a 5-year-old), which are still framed on my parents' walls.

Forward to today, one of the most important times of my educational career, and life, as I grow and create a path for the <em>adult</em> me. I worked harder than you could imagine to make it into UCF’s competitive advertising and public relations program. Because, unlike most college students, I knew what I wanted to major in and I’ve stuck to it for the past three years, without second guessing it once. So now it’s time to put on my big girl pants, break out of my shell and show the world what I’ve got.

It was during the last two weeks of summer and I was coming to terms with the fact that I wasn’t going to have an internship for the semester. Then one day, as I was doing some research, I stumbled upon <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative’s website and it caught my <em>eye</em>, no pun intended. Everything from the logo to the little jokes thrown in the mix throughout the website was so intriguing. That’s when I clicked on the internship link and saw something that gave me hope- the deadline wasn’t until next week for students wanting to intern for the fall! I immediately sent an email and had an interview set up for later that week. <em>Now</em>, meet Alex, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative’s new intern for the fall!

As I sat in my little nook on my first day at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, I looked to my left and saw a tag on the closet doorknob under the stairs that read: “Shhh…Harry Potter sleeping!” I knew then that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> was a great fit for me. I couldn’t have asked for a better first internship. The warm welcome and the sense of humor floating around the office makes me confident I will love my time here. So, I’ll take on the hectic schedule and Justin making fun of my nail polish any day, as long as I’m working with the team here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative. Can’t wait to see what’s to come my way!

Here Is The Tie Between Daily Deal Sites & Education,"Scratch college prepaid accounts or scholarships, and turn to Groupon to help pay for your college tuition. <strong>That’s right, the coupon craze has now reached the market for students struggling to pay their tuition.</strong> As a Daily Deal site, Groupon is looking for ways to branch out by experimenting with unique, discounted vouchers for purchases other companies, such as Living Social and Yipit, have yet to dip into. What’s special about this deal is that it embraces the importance of education in our society. Knocking nearly 60 percent off tuition allows college to be more realistic by eliminating the panic of taking that financial plunge many veer away from.

Anyone paying for college tuition, for themselves or their children, would appreciate the value of this deal. Those reading about this are probably thinking this is too good of a deal to be true, and I hate to break it you guys, but it kind of is. This deal is exclusively for students taking an entry-level graduate teaching course at Chicago-based institution, National Louis University. The deal went live yesterday, Tuesday, September 7, discounting the three-credit-hour introductory course from $2,232 to $950.

Whether or not this concept works, the idea behind it is to provide the initial step toward pursuing an education. If it is successful, we could be looking at deals similar to Groupon’s at universities across the nation. This goes to show the emphasis <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> and other marketing tools have on society. <strong>Just think about the possibilities, they’re endless!</strong>

"The debate big debate: To Google+, or not to Google+","So you’ve heard the hype about Google+. You’ve caught snippets of its new features and heard word of its competition with Facebook, but you don’t quite get the benefits and aren’t completely decided if you are going to sign up for an account.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">New social media platforms</a> can be overwhelming. Heck, a lot of people are still figuring out how to integrate Twitter into their social media routines. <strong>We’ll give you the rundown of Google+, and help you decide if this is one social media weapon you might consider adding to your arsenal. </strong>

<strong>Circles</strong>

In the real world, we have different circles of relationships. We have work friends, friends we like to have fun with on a Friday night, family and so on. So, sharing things on social networks should work in a similar fashion. With Google+, you can create different circles of people and share photos accordingly. This way you can share only your most flattering pictures with Grandma.

<strong>Hangouts </strong>

The next best thing to a real life conversation. Google Hangouts allows you to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">video chat</a> with up to 10 people at a time, and even watch YouTube with them. You can let specific friends or entire circles know you’re hanging out, allowing other friends to join in the conversation at any given time, just like in real life.

<strong>Instant Upload </strong>

If you have a Facebook, you know how great it is sharing mobile photos of your latest adventures. If you have a Facebook, you also know how un-great it is uploading those photos from your phone onto your account. Enter Google Instant Upload. Your photos and videos will automatically upload to an album on Google+ that will be kept private until you choose whom you’d like to share them with.

<strong>Sparks </strong>

This feature is sort of like Google News, only you receive all of your updates in one place, and links, articles, videos, etc. are easily shared with friends. Let Sparks know some things you’re interested in and it’ll send you some things it thinks you’ll enjoy.

<strong>Huddle</strong>

Google Huddle simplifies the back-and-forth of making plans with multiple friends via text messages. Huddle creates one simple group chat where all your friends can text at once. Less time texting, more time doing.

<strong>+1 Button</strong>

This is a feature that, in many ways, resembles the Facebook Like button. Just hit the +1 button on a page to let everyone know they should check it out. If you’re a business, having the +1 button on your page will help you stand out and get better traffic. This is definitely a feature you don’t want to miss out on, even if you opt out of creating a Google+ account for yourself.

<strong>So what does this mean for your business?</strong>

Considering Google+ is still in what it calls a “field trial” and hasn’t yet rolled out its business account option, the truth is no one can be certain. The success of social networks is generated by people. And since Google+ is still in a trial mode, we can’t predict how it will be received by consumers. But what we are seeing is an undeniable buzz and excitement about this social media platform.

There’s no doubt that Google+ makes connecting and sharing with friends an absolute breeze. It also looks like the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social network</a> will revolutionize the business world. Functions like Huddle and Hangouts may play a significant role in the way colleagues and clients communicate remotely, allowing up to 10 people to communicate at once via their personal computers by video or by text. And the +1 button is an obvious benefit for businesses receiving increased traffic thanks to the button’s ability to increase your website’s popularity and visibility.

We’ve seen more and more employers ban Facebook from the workplace, and older generations deny its marketing benefits due to its college-centered demographic. The Google brand may bring about a more widely received approval from businesses and older demographics, based on its professional reputation. Unlike Facebook, Google+ wasn’t first released with a college-only clientele.

The future looks promising for Google+, and while we don’t suggest creating an account for your business just yet (Google promised to unveil an account for businesses soon), we encourage you to set up a personal account and become familiar with the platform. While Google+ is still in trial mode, and the popularity of its future is still not certain, now is a great time to become acquainted with the functionality. To create a personal account and start exploring the platform, you currently have to be “invited.” <strong>If you don’t have a friend who’s got an account, we’d love to invite you! </strong>Just email us at <a href=""mailto: info@bigeyecreative.com"">info@bigeyecreative.com</a> and you can join the party, too.

So there you have it. The wonders of Google+. It’s hard to say how this social media platform will fare against the social media giant that is Facebook, but there’s no denying Google+ has some truly innovative features that improve connecting and sharing with friends, family and even coworkers. <strong>And that’s a real plus. </strong>","We’ll give you the rundown of Google+, and help you decide if this is one social media weapon you might consider adding to your arsenal.

"Where every day is FRIDAY, FRIDAY, gotta get down on FRIDAY","The last few weeks have been a blur of deadlines, presentations and website launches at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>. It’s times like these that have the office operating in turbo mode. <strong>It’s time like these that define an agency.</strong>

Everyone on the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE team</a> felt the pressure of quickly approaching deadlines, presentations and launches, and the office was noticeably quieter. But between the long periods of keyboard tapping and mouse clicking, were the sounds of ping-pong balls slamming, champagne popping and the occasional outburst of a popular rap or Rebecca Black song (given the day the of the week).

Celebrating milestones and working with a team of genuinely great people, allows <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> to shine under pressure. Where some agencies may let the stress of tight deadlines get the best of them, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE team</a> has an uncanny ability to grow stronger relationships, produce Eye-catching work and, really, enjoy the process.

It’s not uncommon for an agency to have a ping-pong table or some other piece of equipment that screams, “our agency is fun.” But how often do the employees get to use it? I’ve been at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> for almost a year, and I can honestly say that this is one agency where what ya see is what ya get. <strong>Awesome work is accompanied by awesome people. People who aren’t afraid to engage in a ping-pong tourney, belt out a Rebecca Black song or toast to a job-well-done after a hard week’s work.</strong>

We take our work seriously, but not ourselves. And that’s what makes every day feel like “FRIDAY, FRIDAY ...”
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We can't lie, we're pretty fun.</p>","The last few weeks have been a blur of deadlines, presentations and website launches at BigEye. It’s times like these that have the office operating in turbo mode. It’s time like these that define an agency.
Everyone on the BigEye team felt the pressure of quickly approaching deadlines, presentations and launches, and the office was noticeably quieter. But between the long periods of keyboard tapping and mouse clicking, were the sounds of ping-pong balls slamming, champagne popping and the occasional outburst of a popular rap or Rebecca Black song (given the day the of the week).",9/22/2011 18:40,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Where-Every-Day-is-FRIDAY-FRIDAY.jpg,where-every-day-is-friday-friday,publish,,Bottom,0,closed,0

Biggie's excited to share his holiday boot camp with you,"<strong>Biggie and the rest of us here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative care about you, your well-being and your happiness.</strong> Therefore, we decided to scratch the normal blog topic on marketing and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> this time, and direct our attention to something more appropriate for the fast approaching, holiday season – a healthy diet and your physical fitness. We’re going to mix it up a bit with some creative, fun and helpful tips to keep your health and fitness regime on track during the holidays.

Now we know we aren’t experts, per say, on health and fitness – and Biggie isn’t exactly one to talk – but we do know creative and research better than anyone out there.

<strong>So, throw on your workout clothes, tie your sneakers and grab your water because it’s time for Biggie’s Holiday Boot Camp!</strong>

In order to be happy, you must feel good about yourself; and to feel good about yourself, you must live a healthy life. So, cut out those boring, tedious workouts and get motivated to stay in shape by watching TV Guide’s number one ranked, most popular show, Dancing with the Stars. As the show grew in popularity over the years, so has dancing as a form of exercise. Many observe the amazing transformations contestants undergo throughout the competition and use it as motivation to stay in shape and embrace a healthy lifestyle.

Dancing possesses both physical and mental health benefits that are often overlooked. It’s a great, unique form of exercise that’s fit for all ages, and provides a fun social environment. More so, it supplies the essential cardio of a workout, helping you lose weight and stay toned and fit. Some other benefits of dancing include: the increase of energy, stamina and strength, posture and coordination, lowering blood pressure, cholesterol and the risk of heart disease, strengthening bones – and many more.

As we all know, what you eat is equally important as your physical activity. Take for example, oranges. “Why oranges,” you ask? What’s unique about oranges, other than the fact that they’re one of the most popular fruits in the world, is that they’re essentially available year round – not common for most fruits. However, interestingly enough, they have similar health benefits of dancing. Like dancing, oranges help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and the risk of heart disease, and provide many beneficial vitamins and nutrients.

Oranges are rich in Vitamin C and B1, potassium, calcium and antioxidants. These vitamins and sources of nutrition help the body during physical activity, such as dancing. Oranges are rich of vitamin C, containing 69 milligrams, which helps lower cholesterol. Potassium provides muscle energy, helps control heart rate and balance fluids in the whole body, which is beneficial for activities like dance. The vitamin B1 provides energy and is also known to be supportive of proper heart function. Last, the calcium in oranges helps to strengthen bones, similar to the benefits of dance.

Extreme social media makeover: BIGEYE Twitter edition,"On Thursday, Twitter announced it was receiving a major makeover and the implementation of Facebook-style brand pages. It seems Twitter is finally trying to shift the Twitterverse from third-party apps and back to the site itself, while drawing more users away from the business-buzzing world of Facebook Pages.

For now, Twitter has only rolled out the brand pages for corporate powerhouses like <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/DisneyPixar"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Disney</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/McDonalds"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">McDonald’s</a>. The sleek new design allows businesses to customize their headers and promote a tweet of choice at the top of their timeline. Businesses will also be able to keep their mentions and @replies separate. One can assume it will only be a matter of time before brand pages will be available to the general public, as Google+ just launched its version of brand pages in October … and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social networks</a> are always keeping up with the Joneses.

The overall Twitter facelift is much more streamlined and you’ll find three new buttons at the top of the page: Home, @Connect and #Discover. The @Connect button shows your mentions and also suggests accounts you might be interested in following. The #Discover button shows you what’s trending and videos and stories based on your interests. Other features include a simpler way to embed videos and more.

For a glimpse of this Twitter overhaul, watch the video below:

BigGuy around campus,"As I approach the end of my college career, a sense of urgency has been growing inside me. I came to the realization that I needed to get an internship that would help to ""build the resume"" and allow me to ""gain valuable work experience"". After a couple tedious hours of online searching I came across <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative. I was immediately intrigued by the wit and humor flowing through their Web site. It seemed like a great fit for someone like me. So three weeks after my initial interview here I am, working diligently, the newest member to the BigEye Family.

And what a monumental first week it has been at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative. I'm not going to lie I was initially nervous about this internship. I mean I have had my share of horrible jobs and was curious as to what part I would play with this company. Would I be in charge of getting coffee and addressing envelopes or would I be a valued member of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE team</a>?

In the past week I have been praised for cleaning out part of the of the office and attended the 2012 company retreat. The office cleaning was rough. I was pretty beat after moving boxes and file cabinets for five hours. However, what I didn't expect was to be treated like a hero after. I mean I'm an intern, I'm supposed to do grunt work, right? Even better than all the compliments for the box moving was that it was to make room for the new employees coming in February. Which means I won't be the new guy for very much longer. The bonuses just keep coming.

The retreat came at the perfect time for me. Being so new to the company it gave me a chance to really understand <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> and get to know my co-workers. The retreat included an inspirational speaker, numerous company discussions and a trip through a very interesting museum (Wycliffe Discovery Center).

Besides the great working environment, the thing that really topped it all off was the gift that I received on Wednesday. Let it forever be known that on January 11, 2012, I was given my very own, company-issued snuggie! I didn't plan for this perk until at least a couple of months with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>.

PS I'm officially a part of the team! No, really. Check me out on the <a href=""http://www.bigeyecreative.com/agency/team/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Team page</a>!

The best response for your web design money can buy,"<strong>Responsive web design</strong> – a term related to the concept of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">creating a website</a> in a way that helps the design respond to different devices that access it, changing with the users screen resolution.

Put simply – the layout of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website changes</a> according to the size of the screen it’s being viewed on.

<em>Think fluid,</em> content being automatically adjusted.

So, rather than designing multiple sites for different-sized devices, the design is desktop-compatible but is also optimized for Smartphones and tablets. The reason for using this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">web design technique</a> is to make sure that it works with the different screen resolutions while still looking crisp and clear – It designs one site but specifies how it should appear on varied devices.

The importance of this technique is emerging fast – The future of the Internet will rely, primarily, on mobile devices (tablets, Smartphones, portable consoles) rather than basic desktops and laptops.

<strong>The Basics:</strong>

There are three essential elements involved in this method – flexible grid, HTML structure and media queries. The main element, flexible grid, is supposed to get you to stop thinking in “fixed” pixels. Now, screen resolutions need to have a liquid layout for the best solution, compared to the old fixed width style.

Having a liquid layout means that the elements of the page are resized and somewhat rearrange. What flexible grid does for this is make the elements of the site proportioned in relation to one another when either stretched or contracted.

Next is the HTML structure, which is basically how you’re design is set up and if it’s done in a logical manner.

Last is the trick for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">responsive design</a> – media queries. This element supports all the same media but has many new media feature including max-width, device-width, orientation and color. You also specify media type – screen, for example.

There are three aspects to consider using this method of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">web design</a>.
<ol>
 	<li>Regardless of the screen size, you need to always make sure that the <strong>key information remains visible.</strong></li>
 	<li>The text must be easy to read whether you have one column or three.</li>
 	<li>Other than the resize, the site must have <strong>thoughtful organization</strong> and is <strong>easy to navigate.</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>Is this the best option for you?</strong>

Three things to consider when deciding: <strong>context, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">content</a></strong> and your <strong>current situation</strong>.

If your website is responsive, it will display the same content to both small and large screens, the only thing that will change is the formatting. So, consider what your goal is for mobile users and whether or not to show different content to them.

A big consideration when <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">developing mobile websites</a> is speed. Mobile users are often using slow or weak Internet signals compared to desktops, and are a little slower in general. So, it’s necessary to avoid using any unnecessary content and stick to including just the key content.

The last thing to consider is your current situation. For example, ask yourself how satisfied you are with your current website, how’s your budget and how valuable your mobile visitors are. Re-designing an existing website will be much more expensive than creating one from scratch.

So now it’s time to ask yourself: <em>“To go responsive, or not?”</em>

"All Ink'd Up: plastisol vs. water-based, what's best for printing?","<strong>Got your brand perfected? All your social media marketing ducks all in a row?</strong>

Well don’t stop there. Reward your customers for their loyalty with a real, tangible product that can also catapult your brand presence offline. A well-made, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">well-designed <strong>t-shirt</strong> can do just that</a>. When executed correctly, a t-shirt can be quite a valuable marketing tool. Think of it as cost-effective, word-of-mouth advertising—social media in a real-life social setting. And who doesn’t love a t-shirt—especially when it’s free! Think of all the times you’ve seen fans go bananas for a free t-shirt at a Magic game or at a concert or event.

But of course, your customers have to actually wear it for the whole thing to work. Start with a graphic or message that will connect with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a>, then make sure you meet what we call the “t-shirt trifecta”: comfortable material, proper fit, and quality ink.Your printer may never mention ink types when you place your order, so it’s up to you to address the issue when collecting pricing and quantities. Don’t overlook this important part of the process or you will risk printing t-shirts that you and your customers will never want to wear.

So what’s the best ink to use on your tee? There are two major types of inks used by today’s screen printers: water based and plastisol. The latter is a thermoplastic, so it will melt or smear when in contact with heat like an iron. It will also feel thicker to the touch than a water-based print. Plastisol inks are often cheaper for printers to use and, over time, they will chip or peel after repeated washings.

Thus, plastisol inks are not our favorite inks at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>. In our opinion, water-based inks are always the way to go. It’s a little more expensive, but totally worth it in the end. Water-based inks are softer, lighter, and more eco-friendly than plastisol inks. When you place your hand over a graphic printed with water-based ink, it won’t feel stiff like a plastisol-printed graphic would. In fact, you’ll barely feel the graphic at all since water-based inks seep deep into fabric.

We’ve recently designed and printed a variety of t-shirts for many of our clients, and the results have pretty impressive, especially when the “t-shirt trifecta” is met. It’s a great feeling when we see people around town wearing our clients’ tees or even our own.

Check out this photo of our newest <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> tee, designed for the summer and of course, printed with our favorite water-based ink.

"Pinning is Winnin': Pinterest surpasses Tumblr, Linkedin & Google+","A new report from Experian now rates Pinterest as the sixth most popular social network in the U.S., behind empires such as Facebook and Twitter. The website welcomes about 100 million monthly active users and according to comScore, visitors are spending an impressive 89 minutes per month on the site.

Pinterest is a great marketing tool for brands—especially brands with women as a primary target. 85 percent of all Pinterest users are female and 62 percent are between the ages of 25 to 54.

From our experience, the key to a successful <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Pinterest marketing strategy</a> boils down to creating targeted Pinterest boards. Every business should have at least three to five content-filled, industry-related boards. For example, if you are an interior design firm, you may have a board for Contemporary Living Rooms, Old World Kitchens, and Trending Accessories. Fill your boards with content and be sure to add some variety. The possibilities are endless, just keep it organized and true to your brand and your audience. Overwhelmed with all the possibilities? Here's a tip to get you started: every day of the week has a most-pinned category for the site. Monday is fitness, Tuesday is technology, Wednesday is quotes, Thursday is fashion, Friday is humor, Saturday is travel, and Sunday is food and DIY crafts.

Get creative with your Pinterest posts in order to stimulate your repining possibilities and be sure to pin often. Always post links that provide value to users. Be careful not to talk too much about yourself and always follow Pinterest etiquette. We suggest using great photography with each pin you make. Pinterest is a visual experience, and users are more likely to repin you if your pins will make their boards more attractive.

"Mom rules the roost, but don’t discount what Dad’s got to say","Savvy marketers know that online moms are a powerful, vocal group that should be nurtured when they are the target of a brand. But recent research shows that we shouldn’t be putting all of our attention on mom—dads deserve a little bit too.

Consider this recent study from Edelman and The Parenting Group: Millennia dads tend to have more online connections than millennial moms (96% compared to mom’s average of 70%), and 56 percent of new dads post family photos on social networks at least a few times per week. Surprised? Don’t be. One in six dads is now a stay-at-home father, and it’s a sign of the times that fathers are taking a more active role in raising their children.

So what’s the lesson here? Marketers should be careful when defining parenting roles. Yes, moms are the major decision makers in most families, but today’s “father” is changing. Today’s fathers view themselves differently from the way fathers of earlier years once did. They aren’t afraid to push the stroller while mom is at work. They’re going to the grocery store and spending time in the park with their kids. They’re part of daddy groups. Gender roles are evolving. On top of that, today’s families are no longer the cookie-cutter portrait of mom, dad, 2.4 kids, and a golden retriever. America’s families are becoming more and more diverse.

Recently, Huggies was forced to revamp their “Dad campaign” after online complaints from men across the country surfaced, saying that the advertisements stereotyped fathers as hands-off parents. Ouch!

Here was Huggies’ response through their Facebook page: “We've heard the feedback from moms and dads alike regarding our recent ads, so we've taken steps to immediately update our TV advertising, Facebook page and online advertising…”

So don’t discount dad. He’ll speak up if you forget about him. Do your research to determine if he could be an important target for your marketing efforts. Mom still holds the torch, but dad’s right on her heels.

SEOhhh! Moving your website’s search rankings to the top,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> gets a bad rap. It’s not dazzling design. It’s not premier prose. So what makes <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> so appealing to so many—and to us for that matter? The answer is simple: When it’s done right, SEO works well… really, really well.  And unlike <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">Pay Per Click,</a> SEO is organic, meaning that results are gradual, performed manually by certified SEO professionals. It's a long-lasting investment in your website’s future.

It will come as no surprise that consumers use the web to research nearly every decision they make. From finding the best local smokehouse and backyard barbecue products, to studying top-rated orthodontists and plastic surgeons, the web is a treasure trove of valuable information—a place of vast knowledge and discovery for the consumer. Ensuring that your website is optimized according to relevant keyword searches increases your chances of landing at the top of search engine results, maximizing the opportunity for converting the active web surfer into a paying customer.

From a consumer perspective, think of your website as a pot of gold and SEO as the rainbow, pointing the way to the riches that await by using your product or service. They’re actively seeking it—using tools like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Without the SEO rainbow pointing the way, your riches will remain lost and unused. The brighter the rainbow, the more visible the path to your pot of gold will be.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative offers Search Engine Optimization solutions designed to increase your brand’s online visibility. Here are a few reasons why your SEO should be performed by someone other than the big SEO factories... someone like BigEye Creative:

BIGEYE's highlights from the 2012 Design Conference,"On June 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>, I attended the Front End Design Conference in St. Petersberg, Florida. It was a two-day event for web designers and programmers covering the front-end side of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">web development</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">design</a>. The first day featured a line-up of seven speakers, who discussed various topics including the future of shapes, fonts, and colors, to more technical topics like CSS preprocessors and CSS/JS tricks and techniques. My favorite had to be Dave Rupert’s hilarious “Getting’ Flexy with Uncle Dave” talk.

One of the great things about this conference is the community. The conference is a small one, which makes it much more personal and intimate. It also gives you many chances to talk to the speakers and the community in general. It was great to be able to meet so many new people as there are a lot of passionate and smart people in the community. Not all of it was serious though. The Github After Party was a lot of fun and I got my first taste of chocolate covered bacon (which I later successfully recreated). This was my first conference I’ve attended, and I had a blast!

The city beautiful: We are more than a tourist magnet,"I have been living in Orlando my entire life. Both my mother and father are Central Florida natives and attended <a href=""http://www.wphs.ocps.net/"">Winter Park High School</a> and <a href=""http://www.ehs.ocps.net/"">Edgewater High School</a>.  When I started my journey here 30 years ago my mother, father and I were living in a little house in College Park on Bryn Mar Street. Since then I have lived in Wekiva, Winter Park, Altamonte Springs and now as an adult, I am back in College Park only a few blocks away from where I began my journey. Life in <a href=""http://www.cityoforlando.net/"">Orlando</a> has changed tremendously in the last three decades and continues to evolve as a great place to work, live and play.

If you live in Central Florida and have ever visited a place outside of the Sunshine State you know that saying you live in Orlando immediately gets some sort of <a href=""http://disney.go.com/index"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Disney </a>comment. I always feel the need to correct people and inform them that Disney is in fact in <a href=""http://www.kissimmee.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kissimmee</a> not Orlando and then I encourage them to come see the “real” Orlando. Usually people do not listen to this nonsense and continue to ask me if I go to the Magic Kingdom like everyday.

Us “Orlandoians” (yes that’s a word, I just invented it) actually have a pretty sweet deal. We have a huge amount of tourists pouring over to the I-drive area (which they think is Orlando) all year long providing our economic stability while we get to live in the actual Orlando, a big city with a small-town feel. There’s downtown Orlando itself with the hip Thornton Park area, Lake Eola park, Orange Avenue night-life, not to mention all the little pockets of artistic and alternative culture like Virginia Drive/Leu Gardens area, Lake Ivanhoe district and College Park.

Thanks to developers like <a href=""http://www.ustler.net"">Craig Ustler</a> not only do we have Thornton Park and the 801 North area, but we are looking forward to welcoming the <a href=""http://www.creativevillageorlando.com"">Creative Village</a> in the near future; a massive live, work, play city within a city that will house people, businesses, higher education facilities and so much more. If you aren’t familiar with the Creative Village concept I urge you to check out their website; as an “Orlandoian” I am very excited about what these ventures are doing for our city.

You know, it’s funny how my whole adult life I have schemed up ways to move somewhere else, yet here I am living in the same area where my life began. Every time I think about moving away something else in my life comes up and makes me realize how much I love this city. I work two miles from my home and I can walk around Lake Eola Park on my lunch break, it really doesn’t get a whole lot better than that.  Most larger cities require you to be in a certain income bracket to live so close to the downtown area, here in the City of Orlando you can truly live, work and play while maintaining that small town feel with the benefits of a large city.

Orlando is also home to a small, yet thriving advertising and marketing industry. There are many successful Orlando advertising agencies located throughout the city, employing some very talented people, as well as numerous nationally recognized schools that keep our market alive with top-rated talent. Schools like <a href=""http://valenciacollege.edu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Valencia College</a>, <a href=""http://www.ucf.edu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">University of Central Florida</a>, and <a href=""http://www.fullsail.edu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Full Sail University</a> feature impressive Florida web design programs, in addition to high-tech computer graphics, music production, and design programs.

I am so grateful to be a part of an <a href=""http://www.bigeyecreative.com/#home"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Orlando marketing agency</a> that pushes me to think BIGGER so as a team we can form long-lasting relationships with our clients just as I have formed with my city.

What do you love about the City of Orlando?

Restaurant success depends on its social media campaign,"As a young advertising/marketing professional and food fanatic, I can’t help but see my two worlds collide on a daily basis. I’m a big admirer of locally owned restaurants and the more I continue to experience <a href=""http://www.eatlocalorlando.com/2011/02/new-restaurants-in-orlando.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Orlando’s growing culinary scene</a>, the more something obvious sticks out to me: As a restaurant’s social media goes, so does its business.

In this day and age of modern communication, everyone expects to be able to obtain the information they are seeking within a matter of seconds and more and more people are utilizing their mobile devices to do so. If you as a business cannot provide that information, you will hurt your chances of being successful. Social media is a tool that allows business owners the flexibility of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">interacting with their customers</a> or followers in a quick and efficient manner. Whether it’s promoting daily specials, addressing questions and/or concerns from customers or just saying hello, social media provides a platform for businesses to effectively execute its marketing.

So what makes social media so critical to restaurants and more specifically, locally owned restaurants? The answer is well… Everything. If executed correctly, social media can help a restaurant thrive. Alternatively, if executed poorly, social media can help lead to its downfall. Effective social media use allows owners and managers to create a more personal connection with their customers, increase their fan base, provide real time information and establish themselves as fellow members of the local community. This is very important because the foundation of local restaurant growth is based on reputation and referrals. Without the luxury of national <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">marketing campaigns</a>, it is crucial that these restaurants create and maintain a positive social presence day in and day out to stay fresh in their customers’ minds. Restaurants that fail to effectively utilize social media will find that just as quick as it can be to build a great reputation, it’s quicker to build a bad reputation through negative customer comments, reviews and poor communication.

If you’re looking for examples of restaurants that are effectively using social media to boost their businesses, then look no further than these local favorites of mine:

-       <a href=""http://4rsmokehouse.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">4 Rivers Smokehouse</a> does a remarkable job of sharing restaurant news and releases with their followers.

-       <a href=""http://www.prato-wp.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Prato</a> effectively keeps fans hungry and always wanting more with photo spotlights of their chef inspired dishes.

-       <a href=""http://www.takocheena.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Tako Cheena</a> establishes their place in the local community by posting customer photos and community events.

-       <a href=""http://theyumyumcupcaketruck.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Yum Yum Cupcake Truck</a> does a terrific job of communicating daily truck location and interacting with fans.

Because social media is so readily available to the public, it’s easy to understand how it could end up in the wrong hands. So before you take your business and enter the circles of the social media world, please remember that as a restaurant’s social media goes, so does its business.

Attire in the workplace: To suit up or not to suit up,"One of the many benefits of employment in the Florida advertising industry (post “Mad Men” era) is that “casual Fridays” apply to nearly every day of the week—as long as clients aren’t scheduled for meetings or visiting the office. Coming from a previous work environment where suits were the norm, this was an adjustment for me, but one that didn’t take very long to settle into. I found that being comfortable in your work environment actually does wonders for productivity. I actually feel that we work harder and better in less “stuffy” clothing.

Just look at other successful companies out there today, like Facebook and Google. These Fortune 500 companies embrace comfortable, casual attire. When you’re comfortable, you’re more relaxed and more open to new ideas, creativity, and innovation. It’s a win-win for employer and employee.

However, there is a time and a place for business attire. I was once told by one of my mentors in the industry that when dressing for meetings, one should dress in attire that embodies the “feel” of the client or their industry. For example, if you’re meeting with an upscale law office, professional dress would be expected. But if meeting with an artist, jeans and a blouse are appropriate.

Either way, my advice would always be to put your best foot forward when meeting clients and business associates. Just think about it—You wouldn’t show up to a wedding in jeans and a t-shirt (well – most weddings), or a graduation ceremony in board shorts and a tank. So why risk showing up to a business meeting in a sundress and sandals only to learn you’re the most casual one in the room? There goes your credibility… and your confidence!

Ultimately you’ll only look as good as you feel. No matter what you’re wearing, there’s nothing worse than constantly tugging or messing with your clothes while in a meeting, whether it’s casual or not. Make sure your attire fits and is comfortable. Self-confidence is more visible to others than you might think!

I truly appreciate the casual dress code in the advertising industry, but I firmly believe, regardless of your trade, that if you want to make the best impression and represent your company in the highest of lights, business attire is a sure bet. Save the jeans and t-shirts for those days when you know you’ll only be seen by your coworkers or when pulling an all-nighter at the office.

Should America take advertising cues from the French?,"A few months ago, I visited Belgium and France. I was born and raised in that part of the world, so my trip was a mix of personal and pleasure. During my stay, I was reminded of how shocking and powerful advertising can be in Europe compared to the States.

French agencies are bold and quite fearless. They’re not afraid to use sex, violence and innuendo to broadcast their client’s uniqueness. In fact, these tactics sell products best there.

I admire the unrestraint of the French—their unbothered attitude, their love for life, art, and food—oh, how I miss the food! These attributes of the culture are translated into French consumerism.

Don’t get me wrong, some of the best advertising in the world comes from the U.S., but there’s something about French advertising that often seems more powerful and creative. I think this is because brands and agencies in the U.S. are often slowed down by the need to please everyone, in effect, stifling creativity.

Brands are less apt to take risk in the U.S. compared to France—for good reason. Maybe our society just isn’t ready for the boldness yet. Living advertising legend Luke Sullivan said, “We are culture tweakers… We ride the waves and currents of popular culture… We play in popular thought.” This couldn’t be truer. As advertising professionals, we need to tap into the mindset of our consumer and understand their wants and needs—and also their limits. We need to be great listeners and answer with advertising that speaks to them.

Okay, so back to France. I want to go over some of the great ads that I saw while I was there. These examples capture everything that’s great about French advertising—seduction, shock, drama, and entertainment; head turning images and provocative headlines tell it like it is. I hope you enjoy this collection!

The first ad I saw was at the Brussels airport. It is quite provocative… I don’t think we would ever see this at the Orlando International Airport:

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/07/a3.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2289"" title=""a"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/07/a3.png"" alt="""" width=""574"" height=""423"" /></a>

I saw this commercial in France. It’s about drinking and driving. This commercial was played so many times on so many channels. Is it shocking or eye opening? Both? What would be the reaction if played on prime time here in the States?
<div class=""video-wrapper"">
<div class=""video-container""></div>

Billboard I saw in France featuring a very famous French anorexic model:

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/07/b1.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2278"" title=""b"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/07/b1.png"" alt="""" width=""689"" height=""449"" /></a>

&nbsp;

This is an amazing and shocking ad featuring a famous model with a missing arm. The headline translates to: “Look into my eyes… I said my eyes<strong>. </strong>So that disability is no longer a handicap.""

Could you ever imagine McDonald's running an LGBT television commercial here in the United States? Maybe—just maybe—they’d run it in a targeted LGBT publication, but this commercial was running on prime time TV in France.

I hope you enjoyed this collection of French advertising. There’s more to come! So what do you think? Will we ever get to this high level of shock and acceptance here in the U.S.? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Music and Advertising: A marriage that withstands the test of time,"We all know that the music industry is constantly changing. From records, to 8 tracks, CDs to MP3s, music will continue to evolve and keep up with the ever-changing forms of technology. One constant that remains is the use of music in the advertising industry. Whether you hear a jingle on the radio or the chorus to a pop song in a commercial, advertisers will always use music to influence the emotions and preferences of their audience.

Why would an advertisement want to use music to promote their product or tell their story? In some cases it's to provide some type of entertainment along with the ad and keep the viewer's interest piqued. In other situations, an advertiser may use music specifically popular with their target demographic. An even simpler example is using a top-of-the-charts song to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">associate a brand or product with something that is already popular</a>.

Here are some examples of different ways music influences advertising and in some cases the advertising industry influences music.

Many advertisers will work with independent bands and emerging artist by featuring their songs in their ads. The television commercial is the new music video. This isn't a new concept, however. During the 2000s Apple was using new artists to promote their products.

Advertising also has an effect on music. By having the opportunity to get their music in front of a much larger audience than ever before, some independent bands will find success by having their music used in ads. For example, ""We Are Young"", by the band Fun had a number 63 hit. After being featured during the Super Bowl for a Chevy ad the song made it quickly to number 3 then spend a few weeks at number 1.

In the case of the famous 1971 “Buy the world a Coke” ad, “I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony)"" a song created by the advertisers was written. The song become so popular it was re-recorded by The New Seekers as a full-length song and became a hit record reaching number 1 in the UK and 7 in the U.S.

http://youtu.be/ib-Qiyklq-Q

You can't discuss music in advertisements without the jingle. Fun fact: This jingle was written by Barry Manilow.

http://youtu.be/X2QnG3DwVW0

The way music has become available by so many different means recently (Spotify, Amazon, iTunes, Pandora, etc.) is also being recognized by the advertising world. Which is why one popular way to grab the attention of potential smart phone consumers is to showcase music within the media players.

Music has consistently influenced the advertising world and as of more recent, the advertising world influenced the music industry. Where do you think the relationship between music and advertising will go in the future?

Instagram in the OR: Using social media to bring comfort to others,"I never thought when making the switch from nursing school student to an advertising major in college that I would have the opportunity to witness an open-heart surgery on a small child. But that is exactly the experience I had last month. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> had the honor to be asked by our client, Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, to produce a video about their cardiology program. As part of that video, our crew was graciously allowed in the operating room to witness an amazing surgical team, lead by Dr. William DeCampli, repair little 3-year-old Emily Stone’s heart.

We literally got to participate in history being made. The hospital broke ground by trying something relatively unheard of in healthcare: <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">using social media</a> to share a live surgical operation with the entire world. The hospital posted images and updates of the surgery every 10 minutes through the photo sharing application Instagram, pushing the updates out via their Twitter and Facebook profiles, as well as their blog. For me, it definitely brought new meaning to a photo app that I primarily use to apply artistic filters to pictures of my food.

The response was overwhelming as the world watched and cheered on little Emily with amazing words of encouragement. It was awesome, in the truest sense of the word, to be so openly allowed into a world that is usually very closed off to the public. Pushing the envelope will always bring on a slew of questions: Why did they do this? Does social media go too far? What role can social media play in healthcare? The very nature of social media encourages debate and provides a portal for honest discussions.

Mike Schmidt, director of digital media at Arnold Palmer Hospital, said it best: ""Healthcare is behind the rest of the world in being able to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">tell stories well through social media</a>. There are thousands of amazing things that happen here at the hospital each and every day, and we want to share that with our community.""

Advertising, taglines, slogans and pictures of happy patients all have their place in healthcare. They play a role in communicating to the public a hospital’s message: who they are and what they stand for. But what about showing, not just telling, what really goes on? There may not be anything “pretty” about surgical procedures, but they are real, raw, and honest. We’re talking about humans saving other human’s lives. Arnold Palmer Hospital and Emily’s family were ready to take that leap by sharing this life-saving procedure with the world. The fact is, surgeons and healthcare professionals alike live and breathe this every day, and that’s what has a true impact on their patient’s lives.

Social media is here to stay and will continue to evolve and change. Yes, seeing pictures of a beating heart on your Facebook timeline may not be for everyone, but I do commend the hospital on using a tool that we are all familiar with in a new and interesting way in order to keep people informed of what’s going on behind the curtain. It breaks down barriers and can remove the mystery of the “unknown” for families that may be going through something very scary, hearing their child has  congenital heart disease.

On a very important side note, Emily is doing well. It was a joy to get to know her and her family throughout this process. She’s a brave little girl!

You can see how the story unfolded on the hospitals blog, Illuminate.  Warning: some of the pictures are graphic in nature.

The 2012 Summer Olympics in London,"Over the past 3 weeks I've laughed, cried, lost sleep, cheered on the underdogs and logged more television hours than I care to count. That's right, I'm talking about the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. I found myself watching literally every sport—even sports I never knew existed—and cheering them on like I was an expert in the field!  From rowing (my favorite since I rowed in high school) to diving, from gymnastics to even table tennis, I enjoyed every breathtaking moment.

From Michael Phelps becoming the most decorated Olympian ever, to Gabby Douglas becoming the first African-American to win gymnastics individual all-around gold, these Olympics were full of amazing and unforgettable moments. If I had to pick two that were my personal favorites they would be, Oscar Pistorius, the double amputee from South Africa who made his Olympic debut, and the ever impressive duo of Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings who won their third consecutive gold in women's beach volleyball.

Then there are the TV commercials. I must say that as a mom of a young aspiring athlete, the Proctor &amp; Gamble ""Thank You, Mom"" ads got me every time. I couldn't watch a single one without balling like a baby. I also loved the Nike ""Find Your Greatness"" ads. Again, as a parent of a young child, these reaffirm that you can be great without being an Olympic athlete.

I absolutely love that every two years we can come together and cheer for our country, watching the best of the best attain near perfection, shed a tear for those who don't, and proudly sing along when our country's flag is raised and our national anthem is played for the world to hear.

Only 540 more days until the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi!

Florida advertising agency discusses importance of keywords,"The use of keywords will directly determine the amount of traffic your website and business earns from search engines. Utilizing a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising agency</a> that understands the principles of a search engine will help solidify a business’ traffic. In June news was announced regarding the frequency US online users use search engines, which an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando advertising agency</a> wants to share with you. The study was conducted by AYTM and showed that many companies undervalue search engines and just how important they are to internet users. Roughly 63.5% of users will go to a search engine every day they are on the internet. Furthermore, only 2.5% of those polled stated they never use a search engine.

<strong>Orlando Advertising Agency on Mainstream Keywords</strong>

The research suggests that any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising agency</a> working with local companies needs to focus on keywords consumers will be able to pick up in a search engine. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando advertising agency</a> can offer a review of a business website to determine where keywords might be lacking in directing traffic to a website from a search engine. Searching mainstream keywords nets millions of sites. An advertising agency helping your local business will utilize main keywords with niche words to produce the proper <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> effect on your site.

<strong>Florida SEO Company Utilizes Local Keyword Phrases</strong>

To be effective websites need to use a location with mainstream keywords. Using Florida advertising agency shows the company is located in the state of Florida. Using a keyword phrase <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando advertising agency</a> narrows the location even more. A company can find more consumers by specifying the area they operate in. As an example, a law office would need to be state specific, sometimes city specific to help a consumer thus location with a keyword phrase is important.

Florida marketing agency suggests Pinterest for your business,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">Email marketing</a> through social media is growing. Pinterest is a new online social media site which was created to drive marketing through social media unlike Facebook and Twitter. Pinterest allows the email recipient to “pin” a brand, item, or ad that they like in order to share it with their friends. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, a Florida Marketing Agency is using this social media platform and would like to share it here. There are several ways our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando marketing agency</a> believes how Pinterest can help with email marketing to make it effective. It is also a new way to ensure there is interest to view the ad email rather than log it immediately as spam.
<h3>Social Media Marketing through Our Orlando Marketing Agency<strong>
</strong></h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida marketing agency</a> does suggest the use of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media marketing</a>. This new website is designed around what customers want. Before creating any email to send <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando marketing agency</a> is going to answer the question about what customers want from a potential business.

"Florida marketing agency combines SEO & SEM, we can show you how!","Florida Marketing Agency, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, would like you to know that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/seo-search-engine-optimization"">SEO</a> and SEM departments should be combined. In previous years, some advertisers ran their SEM and SEO separately. Yet, there is a fine line in which both concepts overlap. Companies like any Florida SEO Company have to determine where the overlap is and whether the overlap is being managed appropriately with a marketing campaign. One example is keyword usage, where a word might drive PCP ads well, so there is an opportunity to use it in SEO for organic rankings.
<h3>Florida SEO Company Explains SEO</h3>

Why college students shouldn't handle social media,"College students and recent college graduates love social media.  According to a January 2012 survey published by CampusLIVE (now <a href=""http://www.dailybreak.com"">DailyBreak</a>), 73% of college students use some form of social media in their everyday lives.  For many people, this is indicative of a young culture that has grown up with social media all around them.  (Or maybe it just accounts for a lot of UCF students <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2011/10/24/students-using-facebook-in-your-class-better-try-a-bit-harder/"">Facebooking during class</a>.)

It can be tempting to hire a student or college graduate to handle your company’s social media.  Hiring a student is typically cheaper than hiring a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida marketing agency</a> to handle your social media, but is this really a good idea?

Consider the case of <a href=""http://www.geekosystem.com/drunk-tweet-red-cross-twitter/"">Red Cross</a>, where a social media specialist sent out a drunken Tweet from the highly respected organization’s <a href=""http://www.twitter.com"">Twitter</a> account.  The message said in part, “…when we drink we do it right #gettinslizzered.”  The person who sent the Tweet, Gloria Huang, admitted in a follow-up message that her error was based on her unfamiliarity with how to properly use <a href=""http://www.hootsuite.com"">Hootsuite</a>, a social media management application.  Such an oversight has the substantial capacity to diminish a brand’s strength. (Although, it was HILARIOUS to see that post coming from a leading non-profit).

While this particular case was an employee error, it has major implications as to the types of harm that can result from inexperienced users “#gettinslizzered” on the job.  A brand’s <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">social media is an extension of its identity</a>, and in the same way <a href=""http://apple.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Apple</a> would never risk its impeccable reputation by putting its social media in the hands of someone who just passed the legal drinking age, it may not be wise to entrust your own brand to someone with little experience in brand management strategies.  Even at a local level, working with an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando advertising agency</a> will allow your business to more effectively leverage trending topics and popular events in order to ensure that your business’s social media truly is an embodiment of your brand.

Contrary to what many people think, it takes significant <a href=""http://personalweb.about.com/od/Socialnetworkingresearch/a/Time-Spent-Social-Networking.htm"">time and effort</a> to manage a company’s social media.  For most businesses, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social strategy</a> should be framed as its own entity, rather than as an extension of editorialized brand content.  Of course, if your social media strategy requires more of a plan than posting puppy photos and keeping your fingers crossed for the best, it might require more resources.  As such, it may be in your business’s best interest to hire <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">an Orlando marketing agency</a> with a division dedicated to social media.

Media experts, such as those with a full-fledged advertising and media agency background, fully comprehend the tactics behind successful marketing, advertising and customer service.  These individuals attend conferences and seminars pertaining to social media growth and expansion, and have a much deeper understanding of the consumer cycle from an overall brand strategy perspective.  For example, who might be a better person to run your <a href=""http://www.foursquare.com"">FourSquare</a> <a href=""https://foursquare.com/business/brands"">brand page</a> account than the social media expert who just spent her dinner discussing the state of the industry with <a href=""http://denniscrowley.com/"">Dennis Crowley</a>?  (Here’s a hint: it’s probably <em>not </em>the girl who just spent her dinner eating Ramen while discussing the state of Seal and Heidi Klum’s breakup.)

Just because a person can write a few funny Tweets doesn’t mean that individual can understand the significance of the <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/"">Facebook API</a>, or knows how to effectively pull and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">apply complex data analytics for future use</a>.  These extremely valuable facets help companies build strong and compelling multi-pronged social media strategies, and can help to elicit customer engagement by doing more than posting random comments about the VMAs and the Kardashian family that don’t effectively generate a future return.

Social media has the potential to reach millions of people in seconds.  A social media goof can lead to a public relations disaster that can cause a consumer perception to sink faster than the Titanic (read: the recent case of <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/14/technology/progressive-tweets/index.html"">Progressive Insurance</a>), and the risk of such faux pas is greater with someone who lacks the experience to understand what it means to manage and maintain a brand identity.

As with most <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">digital content strategies</a>, it’s typically better to invest in resources to find a person who has demonstrated digital media marketing capabilities.  At even the most fundamental levels, it can be extremely difficult to execute social media engagement, even for seasoned professionals.  Therefore, it’s important to carefully consider whether it makes sense to have a student manage the online presence of the entire brand.  If you do opt to go in this direction rather than working with the experts at an Orlando ad firm, you may find your brand strategy schooled by the professionals.

Finding the right creative Florida advertising agency,"Not every Florida advertising agency is a creative marketing agency. In fact, some agencies simply focus on traditional marketing efforts, like developing commercials, billboards and newspaper ads. They may be more focused on creating a catchy slogan and eye pleasing format that they are thinking outside of the box. However, not all Florida advertising agencies that work like this are right for your business. If your business is highly creative, it may be best to hire a creative marketing agency rather than a traditional one. BIGEYE Creative has an long history of working both creative and traditional marketing campaigns.
<h3>What is the Difference Between a Creative Marketing Agency and a Traditional One?</h3>
A creative marketing agency, like <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">BIGEYE</a>, will come up with different, more ‘out of the box’ ideas. This <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising agency</a> may focus on a whisper campaign, which is mainly based on work of mouth by a group of individuals. A creative marketing agency may advertise in unusually places or use different mediums besides television and newspapers, to gain consumers who don’t spent a lot of time watching TV or reading.
<h3>Why Should I Hire a Creative Florida Advertising Agency Like BigEye Creative?</h3>
If you are marketing a creative product, or one that is more artistically focused, it is important to hire a Florida advertising agency that is creative. These companies can come up with a marketing plan that will be specific to your niche and won’t focus on traditional means. If you are marketing a book, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">creative marketing agency</a> may complete a book trailer to post on Goodreads or organize author interviews. A traditional marketing agency may not deal in such matters.
<h3>How Do I Find a Creative Florida Advertising Agency?</h3>
Generally, the company will advertise the fact that they are creative marketing agency, however, don’t take their word for it. Ask for a list of prior clients to see what kind of experience they have. Take a look at their prior marketing campaigns to see if there is a correct one for your business. If your company is creative, then you need to choose a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida Advertising Agency</a> that is just as creative.

Building business with Instagram: The bigger picture,"With its very recent, very public and very pricey Facebook acquisition, the mobile photo maven coined <a href=""http://instagram.com/about/faq/"">Instagram</a> has caught the eye of both big and small marketers, business builders and brands, worldwide. What started in 2010, as a seemingly small point, shoot and post application, has grown up to fulfill the visual needs of today’s tech-savvy social networkers.

So, what is Instagram? It’s Insta-awesome! At least we think it is. Instagram allows its <a href=""http://therealtimereport.com/2012/08/03/social-networking-stats-instagram-reaches-80-million-users-rltm-scoreboard/"">80 million+ users</a> to broadcast their lives visually, vividly and artistically… FOR FREE! With some help from your mobile camera phone and a little photo-finishing, even the most mundane Monday morning office view can be brought into brilliance. Just point, click and share. Its simplicity is inarguable and to be quite honest, it really does make you feel like a pro photo pundit. Its features are few in number, but completely satisfy the bell &amp; whistle requirement to keep this app usable, interesting and easy. Fun filters can turn an average afternoon walk into the embodiment of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams"">Ansel Adams</a>. Unfortunate lacks in light can be brightened with a button-swipe. Even the most crowded images can be clarified using blur effects for extra depth of field. New office space? Share images showcasing the exotic interiors of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your favorite Florida Advertising Agency</a> and its mapped location, using a Geo-tag. Then invite them to come and see it for themselves. Most of all, Instagram images can be instantly shared with other users. Comment and “Like” capabilities allow for easy user interaction within the application. You can even choose to send your mobile image magic to your <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BIGEYEagency"">Facebook</a>, Twitter or Tumblr feeds with ease.  Toss in #hashtag and search ability, and you’ve got a brand building brainchild that rivals marketing perfection.

How exactly can your business benefit from this billion dollar baby? By reaching your audience at their most personal levels, paying attention to their daily interactions with your products, listening to what they say (using pictures) about your brand or the business you’re in, and reacting accordingly. Still confused?

Let’s say you’re a new business, involved in wholesale. You’re small, but offer great prices to compete with the monsters you model after like BJ’s and Sam’s Club. You’ve recently launched your supercharged and supercool looking <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//#agency"">website</a>, optimized for greatness, but there’s one problem… It’s been 2 weeks and nothing. Not one hit. So you pull up your Instagram account, slide to search and see what your industry giants are up to these days. “#Costco” Search and BOOM! Long lines and bustling buyers populate the images before you. They’re slammed! And they’re giving away free memberships for the next month! How this detail could have slipped by you is of major concern, but now you know exactly what you need to do. Within a week, your free membership offer is rolled out and the promise of premium and personalized customer service that only a small shop can offer is still on your side. Your big savings coupled with brand names and the same free membership the big guys are dealing makes you a force to be considered in the market. Now, you’re on your way!

[quote]Just as important as it is to pay <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">attention to your audience on Instagram</a>, is the equal importance of knowing how to utilize it effectively to push your story into the palms of your audience’s hands.[/quote] You’ve done your research and noted the trends. You’ve even found some unusual ways in which the market puts your product to use. Now what? If a picture truly is worth a thousand words, then this is your chance to TELL YOUR ENTIRE STORY! Imaginatively and strategically, you can populate your market’s minds with images of your brand. Build your web-persona using eye-catching close-ups. Share memorable moments from your most recent events. Entice new audiences to check out your next event. Host a photo contest, urging users to hashtag your business, bringing even more views to your profile. Start a trend centered on your brand! It’s easier than you think if you have a few willing friends or coworkers and some out-of-the-box photo opps. Opening an Instagram account for your business is like opening the curtains for a sneak peek behind the scenes. Users can have the coveted opportunity to see who and what makes you tick. Showcase employees having fun at work. Make it known just how awesome it is to be in the business you’re in. Post your favorite photos to your <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BIGEYEagency"">Facebook</a> page and tweet your tinyurl off with links to each photo capture.

Above all, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginuwine"">be genuine</a>. They will know if you’re full of Photoshop.

Read about the SEO Orlando & the Bing v. Google Debate,"The Bing v Google debate is a long running debate that encompasses the effectiveness of both of the major search engines. For a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing firm Orlando</a>, the importance of this debate can not be ignored. When dealing with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> Orlando, it is important to determine which search site is the goal for increasing page views and search rankings, as one rank does not necessarily transfer to another. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">BIGEYE</a> Creative understands the differences between the two and how they effect sales.
<h3>What is Google in Relation to SEO Orlando?</h3>
Googles search engine bot is called Panda. It bases its finds on relevance, keywords listing and usefulness of content. Google is also the larger search engine, with 80% of consumers turning to Google first when seeking a product or service. There are many benefits to focusing advertisement on Google, however, competition is fierce and it is very hard to make it to the top ten pages without a very focused SEO Orlando campaign. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">BIGEYE</a> Creative can create that campaign.
<h3>What is Bing in Relation to SEO Orlando?</h3>
Bing is very similar in the way it locates content. However there is one key difference. Spammers tend to focus less on Bing search results and instead focus their marketing campaign on Google. Because of this, a marketing firm Orlando may be better served with focusing their products on the less competitive Bing pages and it will probably be easier to reach the top ten search results. However the downside to this is Bing has far less users than Google.
<h3>SEO Orlando Should Focus on Both</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">BIGEYE</a> Creative, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">marketing firm Orlando</a>, will focus on both search engines and work to increase search rankings on both pages at the same time, rather than work with just one. This helps a product reach more viewers so key market segments are not lost in the shuffle. When using SEO Orlando, if the focus is on quality articles, the search results will easily follow.",,10/17/2012 12:30,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/SEO-Orlando-and-the-bing-v.-google-debate.jpg,seo-orlando-and-the-bing-v-google-debate,publish,,Bottom,0,closed,3
How does using local SEO Orlando benefit your business?,"If you are using an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando advertising agency</a>, changes are, they are using SEO Orlando from local providers. There are millions of SEO Orlando providers on the internet, however, some are much better than others for creating focused search results. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, an Orlando advertising agency chooses local talent for SEO Orlando because they are working with a local company that is seeking local buyers. When picking SEO Orlando providers, it is important to focus on the goal rather than the price.
<h3>What SEO Orlando Providers Do</h3>
SEO Orlando providers may provide an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando adverting agency</a> or business with SEO Orlando content articles for search engine optimizations. These articles will be posted on the companies web pages so that search engine bots can view the page and give it a relevance rating. This relevance rating will decide whether the page will come up at number 1 or number 100 in search engine results.
<h3>Why Choose Local in SEO Orlando Providers</h3>
It is not enough to just be found in a website ranking. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative, an Orlando advertising agency, wants to keep the reader on their page. An article written poorly, by someone who is clearly not familiar with the area, will come off as spammy and not professional. It is important to hire local SEO Orlando providers to ensure that once the person clicks on the link, they find a page related to the information they were seeking in the first place. While a keyword packed poorly written article may come up higher in the search results, it usually isn’t enough to gain a potential buyer. For that, a certain level of quality is needed.
<h3>Choose the Best Orlando Advertising Agency for SEO Orlando</h3>
When seeking SEO Orlando content, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Creative should be your first stop. This agency will know the best local providers and may even have some on staff. These days, with search engines working the way they do, and fickle consumers who stay on a page for less than a few seconds, it is important to find a quality SEO Orlando provider to keep those consumers reading and keep those page rankings high.

How far you’re willing to bend the bar in order to raise it simply relies on your brand and the image you wish to portray. Thinking so far out of the box that it’s become a mere dot on the map of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy</a> probably won’t fly high when you’re an assisted living facility reaching out to prospective clients. However, a cute little car company (sounds like farksnoggen) can probably get away with unleashing a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Small"">“Lemon”</a> of an ad to prove their passion for quality to potential car buyers.

And what about “and?” We were all raised to strictly adhere to the rules of the written word. Never begin a sentence with “And!” And so what if you do? When using your discretion, and a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//"">reputable advertising agency</a>, breaking the basic rules of grammar can keep a better hold on a budding market. Americans average being exposed to between 1,600 and 3,000 ads per day. That’s a lot of salespeople diving for your dollars. Breaking through the clutter by going against the grain might be what brings your brand to the front of the line.

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otm4RusESNU"">And</a> that’s all we have to say about that.

New Twitter profile pages help brands spell #success,"If you’ve been following <a href=""https://twitter.com/"">Twitter</a> (no pun intended), then you already know that the company is on the cutting edge of innovative concepts for brands and marketers. Marketing experts latched on to the benefits of Twitter when it first began blossoming into popularity in 2006, and have maintained real-time communication with fans and allies through the digital platform’s interface, which is designed specifically to engage with the short attention spans that signify the digital age.

As the need for innovative marketing solutions continues to evolve, so too does the need to leverage these platforms to create positive brand experiences. That’s why <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising</a> agency loves Twitter’s new enhanced profile pages, which are customizable to help brands tell their stories faster than you can add a hashtag.

These days, an active Twitter profile is a necessary component of a multi-platform <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">digital marketing campaign</a>, not to mention a landscape rife with opportunity for marketers to learn about their fans’ interests and address customer service issues in an instant.  In many ways, Twitter is superior to other social networks, due to its ability to offer real-time communication and responses in addition to featured content placement through the new brand pages paired with geo-targeted sponsored Tweets.  The new pages add to the interactivity of the branded experience, with features that allow you to customize your brand page skin to make it stand out amongst the Twitter-verse. They also now allow for a large profile header for a prominently displayed a brand photo, which will appear as the background of your brand profile photo, Twitter handle and 160-character bio.

Perhaps most importantly, Twitter brand pages support a free Promoted Tweet function at the top of the page.  This pin allows Twitter page viewers to see the Tweet first as they follow your feed, so your social media team can refer back to it and point followers to it with ease. The new features also allow brands to pin multiple Tweets, and will display the most popular one at the top of the feed.

[quote]Because of Twitter, thousands of brands have been able to expand the scale of their business by being able to better communicate with fans, clients and critics through short and simple messages.[/quote] As always, the key to Twitter success is to deliver high-quality, interesting content that with engage your brand’s community to leave them with a positive impression, which will spread <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a> and ultimately result in increased sales and conversions.

One of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency’s</a> favorite examples of a Twitter brand page success is <a href=""https://twitter.com/GQMagazine"">@GQMagazine</a>. The flashy backdrop of the page offers an eye-catching interactive experience.  The page designers took advantage of the new features, offering class and style in the way that only GQ can.

<a href=""https://twitter.com/Starbucks"">@Starbucks</a> also takes advantage of the dynamic new features by showcasing a delicious cup of freshly brewed coffee on the background skin of the page.  The highly visual page header shows rows and rows of fresh coffee grounds, for a page so good you can almost smell it.

The <a href=""https://twitter.com/todayshow"">@TodayShow</a> page header is highly visual, featuring photos of the hit program’s cast assembled as a collage, which is contrasted against the brightness of The Today Show’s logo. This highly visual representation draws a reader’s eye directly to the header, buying valuable seconds in the amount time that the reader spends on the page looking at the photos.  The background is set to The Today’s Show’s standard light orange color, with a design incorporated into the skin.

Each of these demonstrates the innovative ways in which brands are latching on to the developmental offerings that Twitter continues to build to better support businesses and help them grow.

As one of the leading Orlando ad agencies, we are committed finding innovative ways to use social media in digital marketing campaigns, bridging the gap between digital communication and offline consumer relationships.  With technological breakthroughs such as Twitter’s new brand pages, combined with social strategy tailored to suit your needs, our Orlando advertising agency is committed to developing successful campaigns for any budget.

Building brands by storm: The real mad men,"The real <a href=""http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men"">Mad Men</a> are long gone, but they’ve planted fertile seeds in the ever-evolving processes of advertising. Famed founder and former CEO of world-renowned BBDO, Alex Osborn, brought brainstorming to the ad world as the building block from which great ideas were born. Initially phrased “to think up,” Osborn employed this creative thought cauldron as a way of generating bigger, better and more brilliant ideas for BBDO clients. His philosophy followed that if two heads are better than one, then 20 heads would lead to gold mines.

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//"">Orlando advertising agencies</a>, and creative shops worldwide, still utilize brainstorming techniques to generate winning campaigns today. In addition to bringing otherwise untapped objectives to the table, brainstorming sessions strengthen teams within the workplace. They foster camaraderie and a true sense of belonging amongst coworkers. Encouraging your group to develop big ideas from inklings promotes a fearless well of inspiration to fill the air. People stop holding back and the notion that “there are no bad ideas” begins to take over.

A look back in advertising will show us that bad ideas do exist, however. We’ve seen them launch and we’ve watched them crumble, as we’ve quietly said to ourselves, “what were they thinking?” Chances are they were thinking… together, but not thinking together. They may have all been in the room, but they all weren’t on the same page. Concepts that start without direction can lead a team to the endzone with a well-developed campaign. But if a plan is not in place before the team hits the table, your chances for success decrease dramatically.
<ul>
 	<li>Define specific objectives.</li>
 	<li>Do your research.</li>
 	<li>Set a time limit - and don’t go a minute over schedule.</li>
 	<li>Keep an open mind and listen to everything that is said.</li>
 	<li>Give everyone a chance to chime in.</li>
 	<li>Encourage participation</li>
 	<li>Narrow it down and walk away with a few agreed upon concepts to build upon.</li>
</ul>
Most importantly, bring your pad and paper and be ready to write down anything that comes to mind. The most successful ideas have come from the <a href=""http://www.odditycentral.com/"">strangest places</a>, so don’t be shy and enjoy the ride. Depriving yourself of other people’s ideas will only limit your brand’s potential. It may be your baby, but sometimes it truly does take a village to raise a child.

Benefits of deploying the use of Git into your workflow,"One of the harder parts about development is the workflow. There’s no one right way to do it. What works for one person or team may not be efficient for you. For this reason it's not something that is widely taught. You generally have to find your own way of doing things.

Today we’re talking about adding git into your workflow. If you already aren’t using version control and developing locally, you need to start now. You’ve probably been told time and time again, but seriously stop it. Don’t wait until something terrible happens before you change. There are plenty of resources (Like try github), which make it easy to learn.
<h3>Once you’re actually using git, how do we deploy sites?</h3>
If you are working on a server that you do not have ssh access or git isn’t installed, you may want to look into solutions like git ftp and git tower. These programs make it easy to use git and take care of pushing changes live. If you do have the appropriate access, you can look into a workflow like the one that net tuts has put out. It’s a nice solution, but there’s a simpler way to do it without the use of GitHub (read: free).
<h3>General idea of what we're doing:</h3>
Because we can only push to a bare repo, we need to create two repos on our server. The first, our hub, will be our bare repo. A bare repo is one without a working tree, i.e., it contains none of your working files. We will push to this repo, and on a hook, have our production repo pull from the hub. Our production repo, which we will name prime, will contain our live production code.
<h3>Setting up the server</h3>
The first thing we need to do is get onto our server. Find out your SSH settings from your host and open up the command line:
<pre>$ ssh user@example.com -p 22</pre>
""–p 22"" defines which port you are connecting to. If your host is not using a custom port for SSH connections, you can leave this part off. Entering our our password everytime we connect to our server costs time, so it is a good idea set up an SSH key. I will not go into that here, but a quick google search will give you instructions on how to set this up.
<h3>Creating our repos</h3>
We are going to navigate to the root of our server and create a folder named git to hold our hub repo:
<pre>$ cd
$ mkdir git
$ cd git
$ git init –-bare</pre>
Now let's create our production ""prime"" repo. In our case this is going to be in the public_html directory.
<pre>$ cd ~/public_html
$ git init</pre>
Simple enough. We also need to add the hub repo as a remote:
<pre>$ git remote add hub ~/git</pre>
&nbsp;
<h3>Creating our hooks</h3>
First, we're going to create our hook that will run when we push to the hub. Let’s move into our hooks folder and edit our hook.
<pre>$ cd ~/git/hooks
$ nano post-update.sample</pre>
Now paste this into the file above the exec command. If you don't want to use the command line, you can always FTP to the file and change it there. When you push to the hub, this script will navigate to our prime repo and pull the changes from the hub.
<pre>echo
echo ""**** Pulling changes into Prime""
echo
cd ~/public_html
unset GIT_DIR
git pull hub master</pre>
Get out of nano, and rename our hook file to activate it.
<pre>^X
$ mv post-update.sample post-update</pre>
&nbsp;
<h3>Getting our local repo ready</h3>
If you haven’t already done so, set up the local repo. On your local machine:
<pre>$ cd /your_project_directory
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit –m ""Our first commit""</pre>
Alternatively, if your site is already live we can clone our live repo. On the server:
<pre>$ cd ~/public_html
$ git add .
$ git commit -m ""Our first commit""
$ git push hub master</pre>
On the local machine:
<pre>$ cd /your_project_directory
$ git clone ssh://user@example.org:22/~/public_html</pre>
Again, the "":22"" is for custom ports and is optional.
<h3>Now let’s add our remotes.</h3>
<pre>$ git remote add hub ssh://user@example.org:22/~/git
$ git remote add production ssh://user@example.org:22/~/public_html</pre>
Everything is set up-Let’s push to the server.
Now that we have the set up out of the way, it’s easy sailing from here on out.
<pre>$ git push hub master</pre>
<h3>On no, the live files have been edited!</h3>
We don’t get a one line command to fix this, but it’s still fairly easy.
On your web server:
<pre>$ cd ~/public_html
$ git add .
$ git commit –m ""Live files were edited""</pre>
from local:
<pre>$ git pull prime master</pre>

How digital video can help sell your brand’s story,"Fewer than two weeks ago, Korean recording artist Psy was virtually unheard of in America.  But now, the video for his song “<a href=""http://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0"">Gangnam Style</a>” has more than 335,000,000 views, and the song itself holds the number two spot on the Billboard charts – and the song isn’t even in English!  That type of crossover language success would be impossible without the Internet, as well as a video that adequately captures Psy’s concept and personality through a montage of humorous visuals.

While not every video is guaranteed to reach 335,000,000 views, Psy’s story touches on the massive impact that a visual presentation can add to a product or service.  People are visual beings, and when a video goes viral, it’s typically because it triggers a powerful emotion, which makes people feel the need to share.

If you’re feeling jazzed about a new product or service from your company, or you want to circulate important news about future projects or concepts, you may want to consider bringing on an agency to help you create a video to help spread the word.  A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">video is a terrific way to tell a brand’s story</a>, which is becoming more and more essential in today’s world of high-impact, compelling digital content.  A well-executed video can help humanize a brand, and can bring product features to life in a way that, even just five years ago, was only possible through expensive production budgets and television airtime.

Don’t get us wrong… at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising firm</a>, we find other digital content such as blogs, photographs and infographics extremely valuable, as they tend to be cheaper and easier to produce.  But when was the last time you heard of a piece of written content being shared 300,000,000 times?  While each format serves its purposes (i.e., our blog a better forum for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> to tout the benefits of digital video in a format that you can print out for easy reference), a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a> can leave a long lasting impact with a higher potential to go viral.

[quote]While a company can benefit from all types of content, many people actively seek out branded video content.[/quote]  Brand fanatics regularly check to see what companies such as Nike and <a href=""http://www.pepsi.com/"">Pepsi</a> are up to behind the scenes.  Brands are essentially now media companies, ones that people look to in order to stay up to date with current trends, ideas and innovations.

According to a recent report from searchenginewatch.com, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video content</a> can <a href=""http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2205820/Photos-Videos-as-Social-Currency-The-People-Behind-Content-Creation-Curation"">drive social currency</a>.  Social currency can heighten your brand’s profile within your digital community, especially if such content is informative, funny, or both.  And, while a cheap smartphone photo can offer fun insights into your company, a professional video offers credibility, which helps establish trust and rapport amongst your audience.

Ideally, a company should target the content portals where their target community already exists, integrating text, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">video and social content</a> into the digital marketing strategy that reaches potential customers across platforms.  But, where the concept and budget permits, a video may be the most effective way to tell a story and allow it to reach across numerous fronts.

Things you didn’t know about LinkedIn – & probably don’t want to,"Many people see LinkedIn as a way to stay connected to fellow professionals.  However, the online resume platform uses some interesting tactics to help put a price on your skill set. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Orlando marketing agency</a> uses LinkedIn to help us find talent, but always with caution.  What follows are some things you may not know about the high tech career services company.
<h3>LinkedIn is a Search Engine for Resumes.</h3>
Think about how a search engine works.  Typically, a person keys in search words in order to filter results.  From a recruitment perspective, LinkedIn allows employers like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> to weed out unqualified job seekers and limit searches to only the top candidates.  That means that hiring personnel can search based on your number of years of experience, prior job titles, educational background, skill set and anything else you put on your online resume.  While in theory this sounds like an excellent, efficient recruiting strategy, it also has serious limitations.  For examples, recruiters will tell you not to use the most recent buzzwords on your resume, but then will actively search for terms such as “creative,” “innovative” and “strategic” as they look for job candidates.  In the end, it’s all about how build your profile, and therefore not necessarily about your actual experience and what you can bring to the table.

LinkedIn can expedite the hiring process, saving recruiters time and money in placing individuals.  Whereas it once used to cost potential employers $20,000 to place one person through a staffing company, such large companies can now manage such requests in-house to narrow the search down to a dozen qualifies applicants in minutes.
<h3>It’s All about Sales.</h3>
LinkedIn has a tremendous sales force behind it.  The company’s representatives sell recruitment products to leading Fortune 500 corporations, and those products are quickly becoming the industry standard in recruiting practices.  Companies that don’t latch on to LinkedIn’s practices will risk falling behind the industry, and therefore, will continue to shell out cash for LinkedIn’s recruiting service products.

While the team at LinkedIn purports to care about helping professionals connect with each other and helping job seekers connect with recruiters, what really seems to be driving the company is the bottom line.  Because LinkedIn’s revenue model actually works (as opposed to Facebook, which currently seems to be facing some challenges), the company is working hard to make money while the company is still profitable, potentially at the expense of the people it purports to help.
<h3>LinkedIn Makes Millions From Users’ Personal Information.</h3>
The leading professional social platform uses your information and connections to make big bucks.  [quote]Data is extremely valuable, and the more that a company like LinkedIn can garner from you, the more that the company can leverage your information to build products that help grow the company.[/quote]  For the executives at LinkedIn, the bigger picture revolves around using your data to help sell products to the companies it services, to offer these companies advantages in terms of competitive hiring practices, desirable skill sets and in-demand job opportunities.
<h3>People Can See When You’ve Viewed Their Profile, Even if you Limit your Privacy Settings.</h3>
Even regular LinkedIn users may not know that every time you visit a profile, your name, photo and job title shows up on the person’s page.  Typically, LinkedIn’s privacy settings adjust to your own settings; for example, if you set your search settings to anonymous, you also can’t see who’s viewed your page.  However, if you’re in an in-between setting, and someone knows that “Someone in the Publishing Industry” looked at your profile, you can click on a link that shows about ten profiles that match that description, with one of those being the person who actually looked at you.  Typically, you can use the process of elimination to find out who is stalking you.  This can offer some awkwardness, especially for small business owners who may be looking into their networks’ talent pool.
<h3>LinkedIn May Still be Behind in Security.</h3>
Earlier this year, more than 6.5 million LinkedIn passwords were stolen and published online, exposing a hole in the company’s security procedures.  While technology moves fast, it’s possible that even six months later, the company hasn’t effectively worked to fix security holes that may lead to breaches.  Unfortunately, the only way we’ll know is if someone else comes forward and attempts to crack the code.
<h3>If You Don’t Have a LinkedIn Profile, You Might be Screwing Up Your Future.</h3>
Even if all these things offer a solid case against using LinkedIn, the reality is that employers rely on it the way that teenagers rely on Facebook.  For employers such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising firm</a>, LinkedIn is a gateway to your digital presence, and will continue to be such as long as the company is making money from your data.  If you have yet to sign up for LinkedIn, you may be sheltering yourself from career opportunities amidst an uncertain economic climate, which could be shooting yourself in the foot in terms of future opportunities.

Love it or hate it, LinkedIn is the holy grail of recruiting technologies, and is around to stay.  If you’re using LinkedIn (and you probably should be), make sure to leverage your knowledge of the digital platform in a way that puts you in best light with future employers.

The newest buzzwords & what they mean to your company,"The marketing and advertising industries are notorious for making up their own buzzwords, in order to emphasize and, in some cases, glamorize trends and ideas as they come into the public space.  (I once received an email from a media company encouraging me to “techcessorize” my iPad – how’s THAT for corny PR language?)  Here are a few definitions intended to flush out fresh trends from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando advertising agencies</a>, and what they could mean for you.

<strong>Aggregator:</strong> An aggregator collects content from a number of sites around the web, and allows people to search the aggregated content to find links that they may find of interest.  Popular aggregators include <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/"">Reddit</a> and <a href=""https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=reader&amp;passive=1209600&amp;continue=http://www.google.com/reader&amp;followup=http://www.google.com/reader"">Google Reader</a> RSS Feeds.

<strong>Agile Marketing:</strong> A marketing technique that involves the use of agile tactics, such as real-time response to marketing opportunities, brief stand-up meetings and investing resources in production and project execution (as opposed to planning).

<strong>API:</strong> Application Programming Interface.  Companies such as Facebook and Foursquare allow third-party applications to access their systems in order to create innovative uses for such platforms.

<strong>App:</strong> Short for application.  Though mostly associated with smartphones and iPads, browser-based applications may connect to Facebook or other social networks, such as Facebook games like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheSimsSocial"">The Sims Social</a> or <a href=""http://www.wordswithfriends.com/"">Words with Friends</a>.

<strong>Content Marketing:</strong>  Based on the theory that good content creates reader and viewer interest and encourages engagement and social sharing, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> describes the consistent generation of branded content to create and sustain search engine traffic, and to keep people returning to a company’s website or social platforms.  (Content marketing = keeping your blog up to date.)

<strong>eCommerce:</strong>  All commerce activities that occur on the internet.  While people commonly think of companies such as <a href=""http://ebay.com"">eBay</a> and <a href=""http://amazon.com"">Amazon</a>, newer power players in the eCommece industry include companies such as <a href=""http://groupon.com"">Groupon</a> and <a href=""http://fab.com"">Fab</a>.

<strong>Engagement:</strong>   The process by which readers and viewers interact with your content, generally by commenting, “liking,” up-voting, mentioning and sharing.

<strong>Frictionless Design:</strong> The development of intuitive, painless digital interfaces that reduce bounce, increase conversion and increase user satisfaction.

<strong>Gamification:</strong>  This technological function makes digital behavior into a game.  Though Foursquare didn’t create this type of tactic, which encourages repetitious behaviors that presumably lead to more points, the company made it popular by including “badges” in its platforms, allowing people to earn various badges (and therefore, social capital) for their check-ins.

<strong>Hybrid:</strong>  A hybrid delineates a person who has a broad skill set applicable to a number of technological disciplines, though that person typically also has one or two areas of true expertise.

<strong>Infographic:</strong>  A visual representation of a data set.  Sometimes funny or downright hilarious.

<strong>Meme:</strong>  You know those funny cat pictures, or those sarcastic eCards that always pop up in your Facebook feed?  As people share those photos and images, and continue to alter them in ways that are humorous and make sense within the context of the original content, they becomes Internet memes.  (It’s pronounced like “theme.”)

<strong>Native Speakers</strong> (of Technology):  This term is used to describe a generation that is growing up with smartphones, tablets and computers as the norm.  These children are learning through interactive games as opposed to books and notebook paper.

<strong>Pivoting:</strong>  When a company realizes it’s not meeting its goals, it may pivot to set a new trajectory.  This may occur in a single marketing campaign, or may apply to an entire business strategy.

<strong>SEM:</strong>  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">Search engine marketing</a>.  SEM may involve paid search, search engine optimized content, or both.

<strong>Social Capital:</strong>  Many people believe that social capital is at the core of most individuals’ content creation and sharing behaviors.  The theory is that people share content with the hope or idea that it will elevate or retain one’s status within their online community.  Put simply, the idea is that people share content because it makes them “look cool.”

<strong>Social Listening:</strong> Monitoring digital media to assess what’s being said about a company, brand, product, or person on the internet in real time. Listening provides opportunities for quick response to customers, get ahead of public relations issues, and trending topics.

<strong>Social TV:</strong>  This describes technologies and behaviors that combine television and social media content.  For instance, when brand marketers encourage fans to live Tweet sporting events, this is a form of social TV.

<strong>Trendjacking:</strong> Leveraging a trending topic to generate buzz around a brand. Like most marketing tactics - there are smart, creative ways to do this right, and also terrible, clunky attempts that get this all wrong.

<strong>Viral Video:</strong>  No one can create a viral video; rather, they can aim to create a video that “goes viral.”  Though many viral videos have well over 1,000,000 views, a video can be said to have achieved some level of virality at views as low as 100,000.

We sometimes throw these words around at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, but we’ll never leave you in the dark about what they mean, and the implications for your company.  (And we’ll never ask you to techcessorize ANYTHING.)

Caring about your consumers time could change the ad world,"It’s a fact that people are inundated with branded content hundreds of times a day. The advertising industry is worth billions of dollars, and brand marketers latch on to this by finding ways to reach you EVERYWHERE, including billboards, television, smartphones, tablets, magazines, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">websites</a> and search engine pages.

If you’re developing an advertising or marketing strategy, then chances are that you’re thinking about how you can get the word out about your brand or business. (Of course that’s what you’re thinking about; after all, that’s the primary goal of the entire industry!) However, as you develop your new video or concept, I encourage you to think carefully about the end result.

Many times, the specialists at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> see competitors carefully craft high-budget interactive media projects without giving much consideration to the most important aspect of the campaign: the end user. If you are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">creating digital content</a>, you are, in essence, asking people for a piece of their time, which, for many people, is more valuable than money or material goods. As a goods or services provider, once you have peoples’ attention, you are then asking them again to convert; i.e., to make a present or future investment in your product or service. The question then becomes: what are you offering this person that makes it worth their time?

[quote]Numerous <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">advertising campaigns</a> fall flat because the advertising doesn’t reach the person in a meaningful way.[/quote] Rather than focusing on companies that have tried to reach their readers and failed, I thought it better to highlight innovating digital marketing projects that have succeeded beyond expectations.

If you represent a deodorant brand, you have to work hard to convince your audience that you’re superior to anything else your potential customers may be able to find on the shelf. But, if you’re a company like Old Spice, you’ve managed to prove that you’re a lifestyle brand. After discovering to the interesting insight that women often purchase deodorant for their boyfriends or husbands, Old Spice introduced “<a href=""http://youtu.be/owGykVbfgUE"">The Man Your Man Could Smell Like</a>,” which featured a muscular male model. The campaign proved such a hit that the man soon had his own following. Rather than leaving the rest up to fate, Old Spice took advantage of this and offered opportunities for fans to interact with the Old Spice Man through their website and social media platforms, including a series of <a href=""http://youtu.be/_-fLV28SkZ8"">YouTube video responses</a> that were extremely popular.

Another <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">innovative video concept</a> came from Mitsubishi, in conjunction with <a href=""http://www.b-reel.com/"">B Reel Productions</a>. The project, called Mitsubishi LiveDrive, allowed people all over the world to test drive the Outlander from their own computers, using the buttons on the keyboard to drive. The concept was the first of its kind, and garnered massive publicity, as people were impressed with the ability to control a car from thousands of miles away.

When Jay-Z came to <a href=""http://droga5.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Droga5</a> for ideas as to how to help launch his book <em>Decode</em>, the company partnered with <a href=""http://bing.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bing</a> to come up with a concept that offered insight into the places that Jay-Z references in his book, as well as a gamification element that kept people returning for more.

The only thing that truly sets these campaigns apart from numerous other failed campaigns is that they all encompass a single quality: an appetite for innovation. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our agency</a> believes that we can also help you develop an innovative digital marketing campaign on any budget.

Apps that bleed - A new technology buzz that's helping diabetes,"We live in an age of convenience.  We can have a pizza delivered to our home in 10 minutes, we can order take out from every one of the nation’s largest chain restaurants, and we can order greasy cheeseburgers from drive-through windows at any hour of the day.

While there are benefits to these conveniences in society, junk food doesn’t come without a price.  Today, more than 26 million Americans live with diabetes, and the majority of them suffer from type 2 diabetes, which researchers link to high-caloric food consumption and sedentary lifestyle.

The digital landscape that we live in doesn’t always help.  It’s easy to get caught up with watching hours of TV at a time… did you know that if you watched the entire Lost TV series, you spent 90 hours in front of your television? That’s more 3.75 full days of your life – and that doesn’t even include time spent sitting through commercials.  There are also all kinds of other distractions such as video games, Facebook , chatting and email – time that people used to spend out in the world, being social with one another.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida advertising firm</a> supports American Diabetes Month, and we believe that the digital era doesn’t have to be a burden to weight loss and blood sugar management.  In fact, there are numerous tools that can help people lose weight through technology.  If you are one of the people who battles type 2 diabetes, or even if you just want to take strides today to prevent diabetes in the future, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> has come up with some digital world ideas that can help you stay healthy and manage your blood sugar in the physical world.

<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/diet/food-fitness-planner/default.htm"">WebMd’s Food and Fitness Planner</a>: This tool offers personalized weight loss plans based on weight loss goals and exercise habits, making it an optimal tool for people just beginning the weight loss journey.

Nike Fuel Band: The Nike Fuel band takes weight loss and exercise, and turns it into a game.  Wear it to track your daily activity, and then connect with friends to compare your progress through a smartphone app.

Locavore: Generally, fresh foods are better for you than processed foods.  Locavore helps you choose the right ingredients for your meal by letting you know what’s in season, and using GPS to let you know the best places near you to buy locally grown, healthy foods.

<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eat-this-not-that-the-game/id361436133?mt=8"">Eat This, Not That! The Game</a>:  This game makes dieting fun by letting you compare food options to help you determine which has the least adverse health impacts.  The results are sometimes surprising, and playing the game helps you think critically when trying to determine whether a McDonald’s chicken sandwich beats a fish sandwich.

<a href=""http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale"">Withings Body Scale</a>: This innovate tool helps people to lose weight by connecting an electronic scale to a wifi Internet connection to show graphs of progress, track weight loss goals and help develop an overall fitness plan.

It’s not so black and white: New insights about Black Friday,"Years ago, Black Friday marked the day when stores would stop operating at a loss for the year, and would enter “the black” in terms of the year’s sales.  Merchants and their employees would leak deals to consumers to lure them into stores with special offers.  This was all done in an effort to clear inventory in preparation for holiday sales, where the companies made a high percentage of their sales for the year while people spent money in anticipation of the holidays.

But Black Friday doesn’t operate like that anymore.  These days, Black Friday is more of a kickoff signal for shoppers to begin a month-long holiday spending spree.  Deals that used to only last during the 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. regular brick-and-mortar store hours have moved online, and may last through the weekend and into the following week, with an event called Cyber Monday.  (The original theory there is that while people had off on Black Friday after Thanksgiving and could visit the stores in person, Cyber Monday served to capitalize on peoples’ Monday morning shopping habits when they returned to work and were sitting in front of their computers).

Today, Black Friday is more of a ritual to get people into a spending mindset.  And spend, they do… Black Friday weekend in 2012 racked up $52.4 billion for merchants across the country.

If your company is planning to take part in Black Friday, then <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida Advertising Agency</a> has some ideas to help you make the most of it.

First, all businesses should know that it is typically cheaper and more cost-effective to run an online campaign than a print one.  Companies must <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">plan print campaigns</a> months in advance, and must pay for advertising space in their local publications.  On the other hand, these companies can build online campaigns in mere hours with no printing fees, and such campaigns have the capacity to reach far more people.

If you do opt to run an online campaign over Black Friday weekend, it’s also important to know what you’re up against.  You are in competition against a large number of massive Internet retailers (think <a href=""http://amazon.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Amazon</a>, for starters), many of whom attract buyers through free shipping.  But as we all know, the Internet is a big place, and is big enough for all types of commerce.  Address this by developing a creative and attention-getting marketing strategy.  If you need some ideas, don’t hesitate to contact <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> so that we can help you get your gears turning.

Finally, if you want to make the most of Black Friday, you don’t need to put all your eggs in one basket.  Continuing to run sales through the holiday season will help you clear your inventory and drive sales throughout the New Year.  A mix of online and in-person discounts will help drive a diverse group of people to your store both online and in-person.

Black Friday can be a big moneymaker for your business.  It provides a platform for innovative marketing opportunities at both your retail location and at your store.  As the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> team gears up for another Black Friday to help drive commerce throughout the United States, we wish you the best of luck with sales.  And of course, happy shopping!

Pinterest: Helps companies drive innovation & revenue,"A year ago, <a href=""http://pinterest.com"">Pinterest</a> blew up into popularity so fast that even the founders themselves were astounded.  However, a leading question on everyone’s mind revolved around a single question: how could the Internet’s pin board help drive revenue?

Pinterest continues to grow in popularity because it offers a visual approach to daily inspiration.  Particularly popular among adult women, a coveted demographic in the digital marketing space, Pinterest is almost an unexpected success in the tech world.

As people are predominantly visual beings, it makes sense that these images offer daily inspiration.  Many brands seek to use Pinterest to capitalize on this, pinning photos of visually-interesting items and offering track back features that allow people to purchase those items directly from the website.  Even here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a>, we use Pinterest to help showcase inspirational design.

Recently, the company introduced <a href=""http://business.pinterest.com/"">Pinterest for Business</a>, a profile model that stands apart from a personal Pinterest profile.  Typically, when companies develop pages specifically for brands, they enable brands to engage with followers in ways that are not available to personal accounts.  For example, Twitter brand pages allow customized skins and prominent graphic placement, and Facebook offers brands broader opportunities for sponsored posts and features like multiple page administrators and weekly data roundups.  [quote]With Pinterest’s launch of new business pages, it is essentially offering evidence that it is taking the first steps toward creating a possible revenue-generating platform for its company.[/quote]

Pinterest launched its business pages alongside several case studies of how some companies have successfully used Pinterest to help lead to customer acquisition, retention and conversion.  For instance, <a href=""http://etsy.com"">Etsy</a>, an eBay-like service for people who sell crafts and other artistic goods, <a href=""http://pinterest.com/etsy/"">uses Pinterest</a> to help showcase members’ products.  This helps members generate sales and thereby helps to keep the Etsy marketplace growing.

<a href=""http://jetsetter.com"">Jetsetter</a>, a flash sales travel site, helps lead promotions by <a href=""http://pinterest.com/jetsetterphoto/"">engaging its followers through Pinterest</a>.  The company encourages brand supporters to post their most inspiring travel ideas, which helps them involve their community.  During one promotion, Jetsetter invited a team of celebrities to name the top pinners, who won prizes accordingly.  Participating pinners pinned more than 50,000 pins in one month.

Finally, there’s the gluttonous guilty pleasure site <a href=""http://allrecipes.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">AllRecipes</a>.  AllRecipes is a go-to spot for the best ways to cook anything from <a href=""http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mediterranean-kale/detail.aspx?event8=1&amp;prop24=SR_Title&amp;e11=kale&amp;e8=Quick%20Search&amp;event10=1&amp;e7=Recipe"">kale</a> to <a href=""http://allrecipes.com/recipe/kelloggs-rice-krispies-wreaths/detail.aspx?event8=1&amp;prop24=SR_Title&amp;e11=rice%20krispie%20treats&amp;e8=Quick%20Search&amp;event10=1&amp;e7=Recipe%20Search%20Results"">Rice Krispies Wreaths</a>.  Marketers are generally aware of the fact that images often inspire action, and this is tactic is probably most effective when it involves food.  For years, advertisers and marketers have been able to capitalize on the comforting sensations that people experience when faced with aesthetically-pleasing food.  AllRecipes uses their food photography and <a href=""http://pinterest.com/allrecipes/"">the Pinterest platform</a> to help their community share recipes through repins, as well as to drive traffic back to their site so that people could find even more meal recipes.

As the Pinterest business pages continue to develop, we will doubtlessly continue to see innovation in how brand pages leverage the Pinterest platform to help make the best user experience possible…. the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> is ""Pinterested"" to see what the next generation of business pages holds.

Encouraging discovery through subscription commerce,"As busy people with busy lives, we don’t always have the time to sift through a glut of new products and services to decide, for example, what new shampoo to try, or what type of headphones pack the best sound for the cheapest price.  That’s why many of the team members here at our <a title=""Florida Advertising Agency"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//agency"">Florida advertising agency</a> stick to our trusted Head and Shoulders brand, and grab whatever headphones we can find on sale at Target.

But, some marketers have picked up on the fact that many of us are, in fact, interested in being the first in town to try something new.  Be it something strange, like <a href=""http://www.cycleaware.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=2&amp;zenid=2v4e0uggdrn3otko9tr1e7flr6"">rearview mirrors for your sunglasses</a>, or something practical, like an <a href=""http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2246523&amp;productId=xlsImpprod4360041&amp;navAction=push&amp;navCount=1"">eco-friendly razor</a>, there’s something inherently cool about being the first person to be in the know.

Subscription boxes are gaining in popularity as ways for people to experiment with new products.  Curating companies tailor such boxes to their target demographic, and a typical box might include products for a young, hip mother or a dog-loving city dweller.  For a fee, the person has a box of goodies delivered each month, and often receives all of the items in the box for a fraction of the price that he or she would have to pay to purchase the items individually from retailers.  Come delivery day, it’s like Christmas — every month!

Besides the obvious financial benefit to the companies that create these boxes and sell them online through subscription services, these boxes can also be a great way for marketers to get their products into the hands of potential customers.  Some subscription services even encourage their subscribers to engage in influencer behavior, which ultimately also helps to market the products to a broader audience.  Plus, many marketers know that hand-to-hand marketing is one of the most successful forms of marketing, so when you can put a product in a consumer’s hand, your business has the opportunity to generate a high return on investment.

What motivates people to trust strangers to curate subscription commerce?  In many instances, the keyword is trust.  Once a company is able to establish itself as a leader, it can then take initiative to offer its loyal subscribers access to goodies that they never knew existed.

Cravebox leads the way in curating boxes and solidifying the trend known as subscription commerce.  Cravebox’s researchers scout thousands of products to bring its subscribers only the best in health, skincare, hobbies, parenting and more.  Cravebox chooses its members out of a lottery, which provides an air of exclusivity for those selected.

Other companies like <a href=""http://12society.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">12Society</a> reach out to a targeted demographic.  12Scoetry purports to offer products from celebrity endorsers, and caters to the young, professional male.  (It kind of makes you wonder why a company like GQ didn’t catch on to this type of trend sooner.)

<a href=""http://birchbox.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Birchbox</a> offers a similar subscription box service, but sets itself apart by also offering links to products you can purchase on the website.  It also offers different boxes for men and women, and offers grooming and style tips with each box.  Similarly, lifestyle box company <a href=""http://babbaco.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">BabbaCo</a> offers the kinds of goods only a mother could love – because they’re tailored to mothers.

The magic of the boxes is that no two are the same.  Each offers a different set of goodies and, if you don’t like it month after month, you can cancel your subscription.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida advertising agency</a> understands that consumers are spending less time with beauty magazines and print content, and believes that subscription commerce may be just the type of marketing you need to help introduce a new product, and reap impressive results.

Ten reasons why Florida is perfect for an advertising agency,"Think Florida is only good for spring breakers or your grandmother’s retirement community?  Of course it’s not – it’s actually an ideal desintation for a marketing company or advertising agency.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida advertising agency</a> thrives in the midst of a state known for its beaches, sunshine and diverse population.

What follows are just a few reasons why Florida is perfect for your advertising agency.

<strong>The Weather (of course!):</strong>  Why commute for an hour in the snow to get to your office in a Manhattan skyscraper when you can instead work from your laptop on the beach?  Florida always sounds like a good idea when your heater is on the fritz and you’re shivering from the cold.

<strong>It’s Cheaper than Larger Cities:</strong>  In the big cities, nearly everything is more expensive.  People who drive often must pay hundreds of dollars just to be able to park each month.  Even cocktails are more expensive – a cheap happy hour is virtually unheard of in New York City.  If you’re looking to expand your agency, but want to build up your practice in a space that won’t break the bank, Florida might be great for you.

<strong>Burgeoning Technology Communities:</strong>  Though it may not be Silicon Valley, Florida is an incubator for tons of small businesses and technological startups.  For example, St. Petersburg’s <a href=""http://gazellelab.com/"">Gazelle Labs</a> is actively serving entrepreneurs by encouraging community and mentorship.

<strong>Tourism:</strong>  Where there’s tourism, there’s marketing needs – and Florida has a ton of destinations.  From Jacksonville to Key West, the state is full of sandy beaches, boisterous nightlife and family friendly adventures, and the companies that make Florida into a tourist destination rely on marketers to keep people returning year after year.

<strong>Fresh Talent:</strong>  With state-funded education programs and high-achieving college graduates who need jobs, Florida is the place to find and recruit the fresh talent from some of the best research universities in the country.

<strong>Second-Best State for Business:</strong> <a href=""http://chiefexecutive.net"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ChiefExectuve.net</a> calls Florida the <a href=""http://chiefexecutive.net/best-worst-states-for-business-2012"">second-best state</a> for business in 2012.  According to the website, the state ranks favorably for business in terms of taxation and regulations, workforce quality and living environment.

<strong>As More Companies Invest In Florida, There’s More Money to Go Around:</strong>  An influx in businesses in Florida means that more people are employed, and have more income to spend on lifestyle needs.  All of these aspects of a recovering economy are good for marketers – more people will spend money on products and services to help grow their companies, keeping marketers busy with a steady client database.

<strong>Diversity in Population:</strong> Florida attracts all kinds of people.  From residents who have been in the states for generations to immigrants who are just learning English, marketers can make connections to all types of people.  Ad agencies that specialize in products and services for the Spanish-speaking population may find as much success in Florida as they would in places like New York City and California, both of which also have high numbers of Spanish-speaking residents.

<strong>No State Income Tax:</strong>  In some states, people pay income tax rates as high as 11% per year in income tax.  Imagine having $11 extra dollars to spend for every $100 on your paycheck – it goes a long way, fast.

If you’re considering establishing a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising agency</a>, we hope that we can persuade you that Florida really is perfect for businesses of all sizes.

Hotel turns traditional hotel marketing strategy upside down,"“Where are you staying?” It’s a surmising question, in the same vein as “Who are you listening to right now?” or “What’s your favorite restaurant?”  For inquisitive trend conscious types, finding out a person’s hotel lodging preference is the equivalent of a dog sniffing another dog’s butt. The answer <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">provides insight</a> into that person’s character.

Stay at an affordable hotel, maybe you’re frugal; a centrally located hotel, you’re a tourist; a reliable chain, you’re unadventurous; traditional white linen, you’re stodgy; and so on, and so forth. Successful hotels in competitive markets know that the key to thriving is picking an angle and sticking with it; a hotel can’t hope to be everything to everyone, but if it can successfully emulate the preferences of a particular social set, it can wrangle loyal repeat customers. Herein lies the key to hotel marketing.
<h3>Expect the Unexpected</h3>
Hotelier Andre Balazs has unapologetically led the way on this front with his Standard Hotel properties. The Standard Hotel motto, “expect the unexpected,” eschews tradition and replaces it with anything bold and brash.  Balazs’ decision to focus on the uber trendy is bold and brash in and of itself. It’s a polarizing marketing strategy, but the recent advent of a fifth Standard location in New York City’s East Village –the other four are located in New York City’s Meatpacking District, Miami’s South Beach and Los Angeles—indicates it’s more than working.

A number of The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">Standard’s ad campaigns</a> have fallen under intense public and media scrutiny for being too controversial. The most recent, titled How To be Politically Incorrect, features a series of photos by Australian artist Erwin Wurm. One such photo captures a woman urinating on a hotel room floor.  Not something you’d see from a Four Seasons.  And, Balazs has employed the structures themselves to act as built-in campaigns. For instance, floor-to-ceiling windows at The Standard High Line ensure that unabashed guests have the option of flaunting their naughty bits to street level passersby.

The point is, playing on an individual’s desire to be exactly that; an individual, is one of the most important strategies a hotel can employ if it hopes to keep that “No Vacancy” sign lit. It’s branding 101. [quote]Make sure your client knows exactly what he / she can expect from you and deliver, deliver, deliver.[/quote]
<h3>Location, location, location</h3>
Equally important for expanding hotels like The Standard is location awareness and understanding that location plays an important role in determining how to connect to a desired audience. While reckless exhibitionism may work for The Standards in New York and Los Angeles, the Florida extension is decidedly more even-tempered. A relaxed spa atmosphere is its primary selling point.
<h3>Florida Advertising Agencies</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising agencies</a> astutely aware of the geographic benefits and limitations of the Sunshine State have the unique challenge of helping hotels with multiple locations, like The Standard, stay linearly on brand. What’s good for the goose isn’t always good for the gander, but sending a mixed message is equally damning. The trick is to finesse— to up play or downplay various aspects of a hotel’s branding nuances, depending on specific location, while still maintaining an underlying intended message. So, it’s choosing an audience and boning up on what works in various part of the world that can help a hotel prosper.

Physician marketing: It's important to ask the right questions,"One of the best things a hospital marketer can do is show genuine knowledge of and respect for physicians’ duties and responsibilities by learning about the service line. This shows a demonstrated commitment to service, and will allow the marketing team to adequately address physician’s concerns with competence. When the marketing team meets with physicians, they should conduct this meeting with the answers to the following questions and concepts in mind.
<h3>WHAT’S THE BUSINESS PROBLEM?</h3>
As discussed in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> whitepaper on physician marketing, physicians often come forward with the solutions, without ever addressing the actual problem. If the physicians are unable to properly articulate the underlying issues, follow a rule of thumb and ask them why they think such solutions will be effective. [quote] The physicians’ responses may offer some insights into the true underlying issues, which will help the teams in their efforts to work together to create the most practical solutions.[/quote]
<h3>WHAT’S OUR POINT OF DIFFERENCE? WHY CHOOSE US?</h3>
A common problem in marketing settings is that companies attempt to appeal to the masses, rather than targeting specific niches that may be specifically interested in the business’s services or offerings. In identifying the specialists’ differentiators, the physicians and marketing team are able to begin to create a selling focus. These differentiators provide specific incentives for individuals in the community to elect this particular hospital, as opposed to others in the community. If there are numerous differentiators, it is important to target and tout those where success makes the most financial sense, such as a practice area expertise or a new state-of-the-art facility.
<h3>WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF SUCCESS?</h3>
By defining impediments to success, the teams are able to work through them in order to determine practical and efficient solutions. If there are barriers that need to be addressed, defining them can help the teams prioritize them and offer solutions for combating these roadblocks. Sometimes specialists have operational issues that are standing in the way. For instance, their office doesn’t have appropriate scheduling software, or their office location is hard to find. These are operational issues that come to surface when marketing discussions begin.
<h3>WHAT’S WORKED BEFORE?</h3>
Many businesses rely on data sets because they offer insight into what’s worked in previous marketing initiatives. Focusing on the positive, rather than the negative, allows the hospitals to achieve repeated success in marketing efforts by replicating successful past projects. Physicians may be able to relay stories of past successes that can lead decision-making. Remember, many physicians think of their practice as their own business, and can take a lot of pride of ownership in it. Their historical perspective is relevant.

Check out our whitepaper on Marketing to Meet Hospital Business Objectives,
<em>While Keeping Physicians Happy</em>",,12/10/2012 20:44,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/With-physician-marketing-ask-the-right-questions.jpg,with-physician-marketing-ask-the-right-questions,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
What makes a social media campaign so successful?,"If there’s one thing we’ve learned here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando ad agency</a>, it can be very difficult to offer a clear cut return on investment for social media efforts.  In fact, most companies inherently sense that there is some value in having an active and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">engaging social media platform</a>, but because they can’t always tie it to an actual return, it can be difficult to determine the exact value of a Twitter follower or a Facebook “like.”  While it may be slightly easier to determine a return based on a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a> that successfully incentivizes people to purchase a product, it’s nearly impossible to determine how a successful campaign leads to brick and mortar sales, brand perception and other valuable consumer information.

But, a new method of thinking suggests that marketers look to other data points beyond a dollar for dollar return.  These new media experts suggest that, in the same way that advertisers can’t necessarily calculate an exact ROI based on the success of a single television commercial campaign, they should stop trying to attach a ROI to a social media campaign.  [quote] In fact, with the field of data science constantly growing in value, it’s highly possible that in the future, big data will be more valuable for a company than dollars spent.[/quote]

The following are some metrics that advertisers can use in order to help them determine an actual return on investment for a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">social media campaign</a>.

<strong>Data through qualitative responses:</strong> One of the best ways to find out what consumers want from your company is to ask them directly. If the goal of your social media campaign is to ascertain data about customer wants, then incorporating questions that encourage them to engage by providing information such as their favorite websites or types of features they’d like to see integrated with your product, then a breadth of data can be invaluable.

<strong>Sharing:</strong> People tend to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">share content</a> that triggers an emotion, and that they feel the need to share with others.  On Facebook, “likes” are valuable, but sharing is what brings your content into the minds of people who wouldn’t have seen it otherwise.  You can calculate shares in terms of impressions, and can compare your shares against previous campaigns.

<strong>Click-through rates, conversions and other analytics:</strong> You can also use data tracking tools such as <a href=""http://www.omniture.com/en/products/online-business-optimisation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Omniture</a> to find out where people are finding your content, how long they stay on your page and other useful information that can help you build more successful campaigns in the future.

<strong>Press Impressions</strong>:  You know you’ve built a strong campaign if the press are covering it in a positive light.  <a href=""http://adage.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">AdAge</a> and other companies are always reporting on businesses that use social media and digital marketing in innovative ways, and being able to capitalize on this helps to bring attention and viewership to your campaign so that even more people will pay attention.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we understand that the importance of developing social media campaigns that drive sales in the short term while also providing a lasting brand-to-consumer relationship.  And in our book, a happy customer is always the epitome of success.

12 things to do in Orlando before the world ends,"12.21.12. The end of the Mayan calendar. Some believe all existence as we know it will cease that day; others see it as a more hopeful time in history—when the many “End of the World” Facebook events are finally removed from their calendars. Whatever the case, let go of your fears and throw inhibition to the wind. If the apocalypse is coming, at least have some fun before it gets here.

Enjoy your last days on Earth by doing a few of the things in Orlando you’ve always wanted to do... and even some you’ve never considered.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.19417799799703062"">
</strong>

<strong>1.</strong> Sing Karaoke. <em>The venue:</em> Big Daddy’s Roadhouse on Corrine Drive. <em>The song:</em> “I Will Always Love You.” And yes, go for the high note.

<strong>2.</strong> Treat yourself to as many roast beef sandwiches your heart desires at Beefy King on Bumby. Don’t forget the spuds (tater tots).

<strong>3.</strong> Sell your gold for cash to the “We Buy Gold” man on Colonial and MaGuire, then put it toward a monster-sized 3D flat-screen TV. Because if, by chance, the world doesn’t end, you’ll have it for the Superbowl.

<strong>4.</strong> Host a disaster flick marathon with your closest friends at the <a href=""http://www.enzian.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Enzian Theater</a> on South Orlando Avenue. Order the truffle potato chips.

<strong>5.</strong> Visit one of Orlando’s icons while simultaneously watching the sky for falling asteroids at the <a href=""http://www.osc.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Orlando Science Center Planetarium</a>.

<strong>6.</strong> Drain yourself to complete exhaustion at SkyZone Trampoline Park in Clermont. You know... so you sleep through the whole catastrophe thing.

<strong>7.</strong> Perform your own routine at the <a href=""http://www.sak.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SAK Comedy Lab</a> on South Orange Avenue. Who cares if no one laughs... It’s the apocalypse, and they’re all going to die.

<strong>8.</strong> Drive to Blue Springs State Park to tell the visiting manatees that you love them and that you think they are beautiful one last time—even though they are some of the strangest looking mammals you’ve ever laid eyes on.

<strong>9.</strong> Walk into every store at the Mall at Millenia and loudly pronounce that you’ll take one of everything. Be extremely loud in Neiman Marcus. It’s a big place.

<strong>10.</strong> Visit Skycraft on Fairbanks to collect various electronics and industrial supplies. Not sure what they are? Get them anyway… in case your inner MacGyver emerges amidst the mayhem.

<strong>11.</strong> Take some of your leftover cash (whatever is leftover from #3 above) and treat yourself to a steak and lobster dinner at the legendary Del Frisco’s steakhouse on Lee Road. Heck, it’s the end of the world, so get drinks and dessert, too.

<strong>12.</strong> Risk it all. Ride to the center of the Lake Eola in one of the giant swan boats during the apocalypse and wait to see what happens.

6 resume tips to help the struggling marketing college grad,"It may be the holidays, but if you’re in college, it’s not too early to start thinking about employment prospects for after graduation.  People who start their search now will have much better luck securing a full-time advertising agency job fresh out of school than those who put off their job search in favor of late-night parties and lazy Sundays.

But in order to start your search right, it is essential to polish your resume so it’s in tip-top shape.  Here are some resume tips from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida ad agency</a> to help you land the job.

<strong>Go digital:</strong> First of all, paper resumes are going the way of… well, just about anything else that’s paper.  In lieu of a resume, try creating an <a href=""https://about.me/"">about.me</a> digital resume profile instead for an interactive experience that also demonstrates your commitment to design and technology.  If you <em>really</em> want to set yourself apart from the competition, link back to it with a QR code on a business card.

<strong>Outline your strengths:</strong> If you want to avoid waiting tables at TGI Friday’s for the next decade, your resume should outline your academic strengths and extracurricular accomplishments.  Even if you aren’t expecting to graduate at the top of your class, you can still add other extras like intramural sports, time spent volunteering and membership in any clubs.  (And, if you’re in your final year of college and your only extracurricular activities involve drunken phone calls at 4 a.m. and sleeping through your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy</a> course lecture, then it’s time to venture off campus and try a few new things.)

<strong>Show off your personality:</strong> You’ll also want to include snippets of information that emphasize your own uniqueness.  Think it’s not relevant that your improv troupe, The Yes Andersons, sold out a show in a makeshift basement theater under Jonny’s Meats &amp; More?  Think again.  Feats like that can demonstrate initiative, as well as display essential marketing and public speaking skills.  Or, your potential employer may have had his own improv troupe back in the day, which is a great icebreaker for a hiring conversation.  If you’re hoping to show your skills as a designer, include this list as a sidebar for added effect.

<strong>No Comic Sans!</strong> While a resume and accompanying online portfolio may be great places to display any artistic talents, which may be highly in demand in many marketing segments, it’s not the place to use the surprising popular cartoonish font that everyone loves to hate, <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/10/03/comic-sans-history/"">comic sans</a>.  The silly and overused font stemmed directly from comic book font and looks unprofessional as a chosen resume font, unless you’re applying for a job as a comic book superhero.

<strong>Offer social media links:</strong> In this day and age, it should be a given that any potential employer is going to check your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Tumblr and any other accounts you have.  This is particularly true in marketing, where companies will rely on your social media savvy and following. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/03/05/facebook-can-tell-you-if-a-person-is-worth-hiring/"">Research shows</a> that an employer who takes a few minutes to check out an applicant’s Facebook page can learn more about what kind of employee they might be.  Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out that all your crazy photos might be a benefit – it shows extraversion and suggests that you are friendly.  Exploit this by listing all your social media on your resume, for easy access.

<strong>List your favorite blogs:</strong> To show off your dedication to marketing, it helps to list a few of your favorite marketing blogs.  May we suggest: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/"">TechCrunch</a>, <a href=""http://mashable.com/"">Mashable</a>, <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/"">Fast Company</a>, <a href=""http://allthingsd.com/"">All Things D</a>, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/sai"">Business Insider</a>, <a href=""http://adage.com/"">Ad Age</a> and of course our very own Orlando marketing agency’s blog, EyeFull.

Your digital revolution begins today: 5 things you must do in 2013,"Each year, millions of people around the world use the celebration of the new year to purge and rebuild.  This year, while you’re hydrating that New Year’s Eve hangover with Gatorade while eating a greasy cheeseburger, it is also important to reflect on the things that you can do to help build your business.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida advertising agency team</a> has come up with a number of strategies to help you evaluate the stakes for your digital revolution.

<strong>Make a Plan:</strong> No matter where you’re going, it’s a lot easier to get there if you have a path. No matter what your goals, you’ll get there a lot faster if you know what steps you need to take to achieve them.  Have a strategy for growth, a checklist of things you want to accomplish, and a solid idea of where you’d like to be on Jan. 1, 2014.  Throughout the year, don’t forget to frequently review your task list, which will keep you inspired to continue to pursue your goals throughout the year.

<strong>Go (More) Digital:</strong>  Still wasting hundreds of dollars each year sending out paper invoices and snail mail correspondence?  Move in to 2013 by implementing efforts to use digital services, which will help your company save money in the long term.  Paperless document management systems make it easy for everyone to go paperless (except, of course, our friends who work for <a href=""http://www.dundermifflin.com/"">Dunder Mifflin</a>).

<strong>Stop Complaining:</strong> The reality is that, no matter how much you plan, some things are going to always come up that are beyond your control.  This is especially true if you are in a business or field that requires you to take risks.  However, people who take risks seek better rewards; <a href=""http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v4/N2/ARNOLD.html"">a recent study of high school valedictorians</a> showed that most were only moderately successful, as they chose the promise of stability over the risks and reward of entrepreneurial behavior.  [quote]When you feel down, it’s important to lift your head up, focus on the things you can change, and accept the things you can’t.[/quote]

<strong>Update that Old Computer or System: </strong> A friend of mine has a boss who hasn’t changed his software accounting since 2005, with the argument that “it works.”  Well, that may be true, but these days, if you’re not investing in technology, you are probably costing your business (and your clients) time and money.  The system was inefficient, impractical and had a limited range to features relative to today’s accounting software.  These days, providers host many effective features through cloud services such as <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/"">Salesforce</a>, which can help you manage numerous tasks and projects at the same time, accessible from any location with WiFi.

<strong>Get Organized:</strong>  The longer you’ve been in business, the more likely you are to have dozens of folders scattered throughout your office, alongside random brochures, business cards and bills.  Take some time to go through your work, clearing out trash and making room for the things that are actually important.  The New York Times reports that there’s a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/01/health/01well.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1355166164-0aexGkJcSXUhEEePRXCZmQ"">link between clutter and mental health</a>, giving you one more good reason to get organized in 2013.

Focus on these five tips, and watch your business scale in 2013.  The team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE's Orlando advertising agency</a> wishes you the best of luck in the new year!",,12/22/2012 10:45,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Your-Digital-Revolution-Begins-Today-Five-Things-You-Must-Do-In-2013.jpg,your-digital-revolution-begins-today-five-things-you-must-do-in-2013,publish,,Bottom,0,open,4
Your business’s missing link: Using LinkedIn for more sales,"It’s a dusty collection of business cards you have over there, isn’t it?  You met what’s-his-name at the who’s-he-what for that startup thingy you can’t remember… right?

<a href=""http://linkedin.com"">LinkedIn </a>exists to help people find jobs, but it also survives as a networking tool to help people meet and remain in contact with potential business associates.  Your network is who you know, but those people might be connected to the businesses and business owners you WISH you knew.  LinkedIn can help you reach out to the people who can truly make a difference.

For example, a designer friend of a friend at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> wanted to sell his products online at a particular website, which he thought was a good match.  He reached out to a sales planner at said website through the mutual friend, and less than a month later, the site was carrying his products.  If that designer were to successfully do this with ten retailers, his business could grow tenfold.

Many people think networking is about passing out business cards and being able to drop some fancy jargon and a bit of understanding about the state of the industry.  If only it were that easy!  Real business thrives on relationships and opportunities.  And, friends-of-friends can be easy starting points to expand your inner circle.

[quote]<a href=""http://linkedin.com"">LinkedIn</a> may be the missing link in the chain of relationships that will help drive your company’s growth.[/quote]  If you want to use LinkedIn to improve sales, try some of the following ideas:

<strong>Ask Yourself Some Bottom-Line Questions:</strong>  Who are the people who you think may be able to help you?  How do you think these contacts might be able to help you?  What’s in it for them?  Addressing these primary questions will help you formulate a pitch.  If you’re blindly messaging your contacts and trying to get in touch with theirs, then it will come off as insincere, and may even hurt your chances of growing your business.

<strong>Create a Strategy: </strong>Once you’ve figured out the answers to the questions above, formulate a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">strategy for reaching out to</a> the most valuable contacts with the least amount of time and effort.  Remember, if you run a small social media start-up, the CEO of a major brand may not be the best person to help your business.  Perhaps you have a connection in common with the company’s Director of Marketing, who holds the power to make decisions pertaining to new social media tools and applications.

<strong>Join a Group (or Ten):</strong> Joining a group will put you in contact with like-minded people in your line of business.  But joining a group itself isn’t enough – it’s important to actively engage with other group members, who may provide valuable leads and information pertaining to your field.  Try trade associations, alumni groups, and of course, groups containing current or potential customers.

<strong>Dedicate Time to Your Network:</strong> It’s easy to set up a LinkedIn profile, and then to let it get lost in the shuffle of all the other important things you need to do in order to maintain your business on a day-to-day basis.  Instead, actively seek out people in your line of work and dedicate a few minutes each day to following up with them.  Schedule time on your calendar each day to dedicate to this task, rather than waiting until you have a pocket of time to focus on your network (which may be never).

Follow these tips, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> assures that you’ll see results. While you're at it - check us out on LinkedIn! LinkedIn may be the missing link your company needs to help grow to its fullest potential.",,1/2/2013 11:18,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Your-Business’s-Missing-Link-Using-LinkedIn-for-More-Sales.jpg,your-businesss-missing-link-using-linkedin-for-more-sales,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
7 tips to improve the impact of your business emails,"Inbox overload is a real problem.  Each day, intersparced with the emails I get from <a href=""http://groupon.com"">Groupon</a>, <a href=""http://amazon.com"">Amazon.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.zappos.com/"">Zappos</a> about new products and flash sales, I receive long business emails from potential associates and partners.  Sometimes, there’s just not enough hours in the day to go through all of it.

So, I’ve compiled a list of patterns that I’ve noticed in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising agency</a> world that almost always trigger a response to business emails.  Because of the nature of my work, I might be dealing with a marketing executive with limited time, or with a overwhelmed assistant.  Here’s what you can do to help improve your business emails response rates.

<strong>Make Your Subject Line is Straightforward:</strong> If you’re trying to confirm a meeting, it’s incredibly important to include the name, time and location in the subject line.  First of all, this is much clearer to your colleague than a general subject line like “today,” plus that person can flag it to easily access it.  Also try this when scheduling phone calls and providing notice of events.

<strong>Make Sure It’s Important:</strong>  If you’re asking for feedback on a project that you should be able to handle yourself, then perhaps you can save your superior some time by exercising judgment. [quote] In this present landscape of agile techniques, many companies would rather their employees take risks up front, rather than have to wait months to get anything completed.[/quote]  Yes, there is the risk that your superior or colleagues won’t approve, but they’ll forget all about it once you’ve earned them a goldmine.  The simple realization that your coworkers’ time is valuable should be enough to help determine when you need a response, and when you don’t.

<strong>Respond on the Right Thread:</strong> You have two dialogues going on with the same two people; one is about your annual contract renewal and budget, while the other is about a small party you’re hosting.  Keeping information organized by replying on the right chain will eliminate the need to have to sort through a hundred emails trying to find the name of the restaurant the client recommended for the event.

<strong>Use Proper Grammar and Spelling:</strong> Conversational style is ok, but if u r wrting emails w/typos, it can b rly annoying 4 the rdr!  u c what I mean? its not hard. thx.

<strong>Keep it Brief:</strong>  Have you ever spent three paragraphs writing something, then realized you could say the same thing in one sentence?  Do your reader a favor and revise your message to be clear and concise.  A text-heavy email WILL get buried in my inbox, regardless of how important it is.

<strong>Ask a Question:</strong>  If you’re expecting a reply, make sure there’s something to reply to.  It’s easy to write “Thoughts?” but if you have specific concepts you’d like your colleague to address, why not save that person time by ask him directly?  Asking questions is a smart way to get your reader’s input, and also to also gauge your reader’s interest in the subject matter.

<strong>Make Attachments Easy to Open:</strong> This seems like a no-brainer, but every time someone shoots me a resume in an unrecognized file format, it’s enough to make me forget about that person during hiring time.  You can’t go wrong with a PDF, which stands for “Portable Document Format.”  PDFs were specifically designed to be universal, and anyone on any computer with internet access can download Adobe Reader.

Follow these tips, and I can ensure you’ll have a heightened response rate.  I encourage the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a> to implement these strategies… which is why I ALWAYS reply to my team members’ emails!

Read up on why a hospital really does need a Twitter handle,"Before <a href=""http://twitter.com"">Twitter</a>, most hospitals connected to potential patients through direct mail marketing, newsletters, press releases and fundraisers.  While each of those items is still important to a hospital’s integrated marketing scheme, many hospitals and other health care organizations have also found success using tools created for the digital age.

Your hospital already has a <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a> page, and has thousands of Facebook members as fans.  Many of them are partners within your community, people who’ve lived to see another day due to the hospital’s services, and the physicians that comprise your hospital’s team.   It also also has a website, chock full of relevant information and designed using state of the art concepts for search marketing, which ensures that when people Google your hospital, they can find everything they need.

So, do you really <em>need</em> to be on Twitter?

In a word, no.  But will being on Twitter help your hospital’s business?  You betcha.

“Need” implies a basic, fundamental state of being.  Your hospital will probably survive without a Twitter handle.  People fall ill all of the time, and with a baby boomer population nearing elderly age, there’s going to be a constant need for the services of educated people who can treat all types of ailments.

But, is it a <em>good idea</em> for your hospital to be on Twitter?  That’s another question.

[quote]Twitter helps people and businesses connect in ways that were impossible before the 140-characters-or-less application disrupted the way people communicate online.[/quote]  Twitter corners an area of the market that Facebook doesn’t – it’s a real-time stream of happenings, thoughts and ideas.  With Twitter, it’s easy for brands to follow companies that are of interest to them, and garner followers.

If you’re considering incorporating Twitter into your hospital’s marketing strategy in 2013, here are some tips to help you get the maximum impact:

<strong>Use it to Share Information:</strong>  If you see an article about a new radiology treatment that might be interesting to your patients, don’t hesitate to share.  Or, if your hospital is mentioned for its service or expertise, be sure to retweet, which serves as a testimonial to your team.  Doing these things will establish you as a leading healthcare services provider within your field.

<strong>Get Input from Followers:</strong>  If you’re seeking honest opinions, Twitter is the place to go.  People tend to censor themselves less on the internet than they might in real life, so it’s essential that if you’re trying to elicit quantitative information, you do so in a way that doesn’t cause any backlash.  Asking for opinions on controversial subjects will hurt your hospital’s reputation.

<strong>Brag a Little:</strong> Was one of your physicians nominated for an award?  Was your hospital ranked the best in your region?  Items like this are brag-worthy, and you can post Tweets alongside press releases and Facebook status updates.  Many internet users prefer Twitter to Facebook because of it’s quick and efficient design, meaning that you may miss a large section of your existing segment if you fail to post to Twitter.

<strong>Interact With Others:</strong>  Twitter is great way for you to reach out to your subscribers, but it’s also a terrific way for them to reach out to you.  People may have informal questions pertaining to new hours for specialty units, or may want to know where they can park nearby.  Responding to a Tweet can help build rapport and trust between you and your patient, and will keep that person coming back because she knows your team is committed to providing impeccable service.

Even if you don’t think you need to have a Twitter account for your hospital marketing efforts, the platform offers yet another way to connect with your audience.  At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we can help your team develop an integrated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a> that includes creating and maintaining an active Twitter account.  Don’t worry - we’ve got a handle on it!",,1/4/2013 9:27,13,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Getting-a-Handle-On-It-Does-a-Hospital-Really-Need-a-Twitter-Handle-.jpg,does-a-hospital-really-need-a-twitter-handle,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
How content marketing will revolutionize brands in 2013,"You know how those banner ads flash across your screen on just about every single web page in existence?  Well, they’ve been pretty much unchanged since 1995.

Inc. <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/201212/adam-bluestein/ads-will-be-articles.html"">reported last month</a> that content marketing is the wave of the future as part of its series on <em>How (and Where) to Make Money in 2013 (and Beyond).</em> And your friends at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your favorite Florida advertising agency</a> just want to say…

Duh!

Earlier this year at an industry conference, I heard from a range of speakers who suggested that if brands are treating themselves as media companies, they are going to fall behind.  As the traditional media outlet dies, branded content will reign supreme.  And, while there’s always going to be a place for hard-hitting, unbiased journalism, branded content is really just an extension of television networks that make money by selling relevant ad time during popular television shows.

Perhaps this is a bit confusing for some people.  But the Internet made it possible for brands to independently establish media companies as part of their digital identities, outside of the confines of the Viacom empire, NBC Universal, CBS, Disney, ABC or the stronghold of Rupert Murdoch.  In this digital world, brands no longer have to rely on such media companies to push their content – they can create their own.  Hence, branded content is taking the place of “traditional” media.  One example is <a href=""http://thezoereport.tumblr.com/"">The Zoe Report</a>, a lifestyle blog from celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe, which tracks back to her own commerce site.  The Zoe Report also soups ups your inbox with daily tips and deals to subscribers’ inboxes, which leaves her with a solid email marketing platform to boot.

Escape My Life, a web series from Ford Escape, stars comedian Natasha Leggero, perhaps most notable for her stint as a judge on NBC’s Last Comic Standing.  In a sense, it’s like an extended commercial, but the story drives the content and keeps it interesting with humor.

Does it still seem so far-fetched that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> is the wave the future (or even the present)?  [quote]Digital content is relatively inexpensive to make, and doesn’t have the added shipping and printing charges of direct mail marketing.[/quote] Companies who engage in content marketing have the power to reach millions of people, and can keep them coming back for more.  Marketers can reach out to people using tools as varied as Facebook to Reddit.

Even with items as simple as sponsored posts on already-popular websites such as Gawker counts as content marketing, which is the younger sister of the sponsored pull-outs you see in major newspapers across the country.  Many times, there is little difference between the type of content that the publication would typically publish and the sponsored content. Conversion Planet is vying for the top space in this growing digital field, with real-time content and analytics that help measure success.

Marketers can latch on to this field by developing interesting <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content strategies</a> that involve text, blogging, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media and video content</a>. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida marketing agency</a> encourages your team to develop an integrated content strategy this year in order to help solidify your team as leaders your field, and to keep people coming back to you for more.",,1/7/2013 10:53,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/How-Content-Marketing-Will-Revolutionize-Brands-in-2013.jpg,how-content-marketing-will-revolutionize-brands-in-2013,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
Multi-screen generations & how to properly market to them,"In a world where children aren’t being taught cursive (because, frankly, who needs it when you have a tablet?), it’s getting harder and harder for marketers to stay in touch with the younger generation.  Back in our day, we didn’t have to worry about chargers and crashing devices – in fact, we could just tell our teachers that the dog ate our homework.

The digital age marks a time where children are growing up with Facebook and using electronic devices to learn through interactive games.  Remember the years that parents spent questioning whether it was appropriate to sit our children down in front of the television for hours on end?  Looking toward the future, we’ll have the same questions about the tablet, in addition to things we never had to worry about such as cyberbullying, internet predators and other as of yet unknown cyber threats.

But, there are also a lot of positives – children who are learning how to use devices at a young age are also testing higher in certain academic subjects, at least in part due to the fact that their parents are treating their devices as tools in the education process.

So, how can this information help a marketer who is trying to reach a multi-screen generation?

First of all, it is important to remember that things are much different than they were back then.  As much as we were dazzled by cereal commercials and <a href=""http://www.smokeybear.com"">Smoky the Bear</a>, children are living in a different world than we did.  Technology has changed everything; even the <em>idea</em> of a smartphone would have been a fantasy when I was ten years old.

A marketer who is trying to reach a multi-screen generation can work to do so by creating interactive games that create an engaging experience for a child.  Obviously, there are privacy restrictions, particularly when it comes to collecting information about children and advertising to them.  But games are typically a safety net – a company-sponsored game using augmented reality or other features helps reach a child with its high levels of stimulation.  You can also reach them by having a fun and interactive website.

[quote]Though I mostly focus on the use of technology in the digital space, hand-to-hand marketing is still one of the most effective ways to reach children.  [/quote]At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we often advise clients to market at events catered to children and teens, and to tie it in with a digital strategy.  If children have smartphones, there may be ways for a child to directly engage with your brand through the use of social media.  Perhaps they can unlock rewards with their Facebook check-ins, or by offering testimonials as to your product that you can post on YouTube and other media outlets.  Because our adolescents and teens have grown up in a digital world, they are practically socialized to do these things, which is why they are of special interest to marketers.

If you do engage in good old-fashioned television advertising, it may be beneficial to integrate your campaign with an interactive digital component.  Nokia’s recent <a href=""http://www.workforwill.com/"">Work for Will</a> campaign, featuring  <em>Up All Night</em>’s Will Arnett (also of Arrested Development fame), invited people to log online to create a digital product, in order to be given the chance be Will Arnett’s personal assistant for a day.

Marketing to a multi-screen generation means thinking like someone with multitude of screens.  If your advertising and marketing campaign doesn’t reach your younger audience on all screens, then allow <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> to design one for you that will!",,1/8/2013 9:23,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Multiple-Personalities-Marketing-to-a-Multi-Screen-Generation.jpg,marketing-to-a-multi-screen-generation,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
Crash & burn: A story of overzealous growth & what NOT to do,"It’s a tale of two companies.  The first, a major flash sales company that scaled at an unprecedented rate, only to find itself in the trenches within a year of its IPO.  The second, a company that organically grew from the ground up with staying power to become one of the leading grocery store chains in the entire country.

While the two companies are in unrelated fields, the stories are still relevant to one another in showing how growth based on wild overvaluations and non-sustainable projections can cause turmoil for some of the biggest companies in the world.

Just two years ago,<a href=""https://www.groupon.com/""> Groupon</a> was on the forefront of a revolutionary new industry, which it dubbed daily deals.  The original idea was actually quite simple: if a certain number of people sprung for a daily deal, then the deal would be on, and each person would get a massive discount at a salon, restaurant or other type of company.  In exchange for a successful deal, the company would pay the merchant up front for the revenue it generated from the deal, sans the cut from Groupon, which brokered the deal.

Groupon experienced unprecedented growth, becoming one of the fastest-growing companies in the history of tech.  Investors talked about how daily deals were going to be the next big thing, and insistent that it was urgent that the company scale in order to help dominate the industry.

Flash forward two years later, and Groupon is struggling.  Merchants who took Groupon’s offer for cash up front in advance of customer visitation feel shorted by their deals.  Purchasers notice the diminished quality of Groupon-afflicted restaurants they once loved.  While CEO Andrew Mason attributes the company’s record low stock level to losses overseas, the staunch reality is that investors overvalued the company’s worth.  Much like the real estate bubble or any other industry in which the market has failed to correct itself, the bubble burst (and in Groupon’s case, the bubble burst with a particularly loud and painful pop).

Contrast that a grocery store chain that started as a small market, dedicated to providing the freshest produce, cheeses and organic foods to people within its community.  <a href=""http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/"">Whole Foods</a> is now a leader in providing healthy options, fresh foods and high-quality lifestyle goods. Years ago, Whole Foods founders John Mackey and Renee Lawson Hardy were evicted from their apartment for using it for storage for their natural foods store.  They borrowed $45,000 from friends and family to keep their company afloat.  In their third year, they merged their natural goods store with another local grocery, resulting in the Whole Foods concept.

Whole Foods was later able to successfully grow its business by purchasing other natural goods stores, resulting in rapid expansion over the next several years.  The company continues to prosper by offering superior goods and products at reasonable prices, while also offering food demonstrations, donating money to other local natural food non-profits, and remaining dedicated to it’s core mission of improving the lives of its customers.

In spelling out the two stories, the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> notice a markedly different strategy for growth.  While one company put everything on the line to make a few bucks in the short term, ultimately hurting its entire business model, the other company gradually became a leader in its industry, fostering a sustainable business model to become a Fortune 500 Company.

If you’re looking to grow your business, strive to take it to the next level by effectively scaling, rather than gambling on a risk that doesn’t pan out.  Otherwise, you might find your company in the trenches as you struggle to make ends meet.

How three businesses are turning tech into sustainable business,"According to a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/2012-hottest-year-on-record-in-continental-us-noaa-says/2013/01/08/5c9dc1ae-55d9-11e2-8b9e-dd8773594efc_story.html"">Washington Post report</a> published on Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that 2012 was the hottest on record for the lower 48 states, indicative of a trend of hotter, drier and potentially more extreme weather.  The scientists reported that, while some of this increase is due to cyclical weather patterns, it is also due at least in part of the burning of fossil fuels, which is thereby contributing to climate change.

While people have been discussing the potential dangers of climate change for decades, there have also been many reasons for businesses to discount their role in vying for economically sustainable business.  Finding ways to reduce, reuse and recycle may be more expensive and difficult to enact, resulting in a string of complex issues for many companies that seek to keep shareholders happy by keeping the bottom line as low as possible.

However, a new breed of entrepreneurs is vested in finding ways to revolutionize their respective industries, with an understanding that while costs may be higher in the short-term, the sustainable practices will cut operating costs and increase efficiency down the line.

Specifically, some tech, media and marketing companies are now working harder than ever to ensure sustainable business.  What follows are some of our Florida marketing agency’s favorites:

<a href=""http://www.aiso.net/"">Affordable Internet Services Online</a>

What sets AISO apart is not necessarily its services, though those are top-of-the-line amongst competing web hosting providers.  AISO’s AMD Opteron servers, which are powered by IBM, use 60% less energy and generate 50% less heat than competitors.  And, being located in the Palm Valley Desert offers another environmental perk – the company’s facility is 100% solar powered, and has been for 14 years.

<a href=""http://www.peak-ryzex.com/"">Peak-Ryzex</a>

Peak-Ryzex specializes in upkeeping and maintaining products that are still functional, but that would otherwise end up in landfills.  In 2006, the Ryzex Group made a drastic move and got rid of all of its trash cans, leading to a business environment where the employees recycle everything – literally.  Since it’s recent merger with Peak, we have our fingers crossed that the Ryzex family will keep its traditions alive and will spread them to other industries.

<a href=""http://www.recellular.com"">ReCellular</a>

The name says it all.  ReCellular is an online company dedicated to allowing people to buy and sell electronic devices that they might otherwise discard.  Through a division called Securetrade-in, the company offers easy and efficient tools to help you assess the value of your gently used device, which you can then sell back to for someone else to purchase. They’ll even scrub and remove your data for you, in case you forget to do so yourself before sending it in. Once you’ve sold, you can use your extra cash to purchase a used device through another division called MobileKarma.

If you think your company can’t be green, too, take some inspiration from these companies and make small strides toward operating a green business.  By going paperless, purchasing gently used equipment and recycling your own goods, you can do your part to help your company contribute to sustainability (and, at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a>, we’ve learned that we can save a few bucks, too!).

Want to launch a mobile app? Ask yourself these questions first,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Mobile apps</a> are all the rage.  There are literally thousands of apps in the iTunes app store, with more and more created every day.  You have an idea for how you think you might be able to grow your business through a mobile app, but you’re not entirely sure.  However, since everyone else is doing it, it must be the thing to do… right?

Not necessarily.  Lots of media companies that have developed complicated apps have watched them go bust as they find out that their subscribers, followers and readers aren’t necessarily interested in getting their information from a mobile app.  If you’re thinking of creating one for your brand or business, the team at our <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">Orlando marketing agency</a> thinks you should ask yourself these questions first:
<h3>Am I providing a service that no one else is providing?</h3>
While this question won’t hold true across the board (the New York Times app is always going to be able to compete with the CNN app), many apps fail because they are providing a service similar to, if not identical to, a service that’s already being provided.

[quote]<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/the-daily-mom-app/"">Want to check out a success story in the mobile app market? BIGEYE teamed up with The Daily Mom to develop a unique and sophisticated app that reached the Top 25 Downloads Position on iTunes.</a> [/quote]

Recently, someone turned me on to a new local neighborhood app.  The problem was, everything on the app is also available on Yelp, Google Maps and a variety of other platforms.  What would be the point of having another app to clutter my home screen?  I would advise that developer to pivot as needed to ensure that he is not duplicating something already in existence.
<h3>Will a mobile app provide features that a mobile optimized web page can’t?</h3>
If it takes a person as many steps to sift through your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile app</a> as it does for them to directly access your website, then it may be wise for you to save your money and focus on mobile optimization.

Along the same lines, it’s important to consider whether your app will add anything to current marketing efforts.  I overheard an individual at an independently owned media company say that his company had to kill its mobile app, as it was a waste of resources for them.  Why?  Because people were discovering his company’s content through <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media links</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a>, making it unnecessary for his email subscribers and social media followers to take the extra step to download the app.
<h3>Is this the best use of my budget?</h3>
A strong mobile app can cost a small fortune to develop, particularly if you’re trying to trying to do something innovative that’s never been done before.  But, it’s not just the cost of creating a mobile app – it’s the cost of maintaining it and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">continually feeding it content</a>.  It’s also the costs to keep it up-to-date with the newest technologies, in order to offer advanced features.  In the first stages of an app, these items are crucial, as no one is interested in downloading an app that will only cause problems and headaches.

[quote]Once you’ve answered these hard-hitting, bottom-line questions, it’s time to determine whether your company or brand really needs a mobile app. [/quote] At our Florida advertising agency, we believe that in the future, mobile apps will be a necessity – but that it certainly isn’t the case today.  As of July 2012, <a href=""http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/young-adults-and-teens-lead-growth-among-smartphone-owners/"">only 55.5% of U.S. mobile subscribers owned smartphones</a>, though this is sure to change in the coming years.

With Complete the Pair, you're a shoe in—literally. Here's how it works! Simply visit their website and place an order for a pair of brand new shoes. Complete the Pair will send one shoe to your prospect and the other to you—both beautifully shrink wrapped in clear plastic. Try to get that lost in a stack of mail!

Attached to the prospect's shoe will be a unique code and instructions directing them to the Complete the Pair website. Once the code is entered, they'll see a personal message inviting them to ""complete the pair"" simply by attending a short meeting with you. More than likely, they'll agree to it for two reasons—one is they'll be excited to meet with someone like you who creatively thinks outside the box, and the other is to support a great humanitarian cause. Because once the shoes are reconnected and returned to us, Complete the Pair will provide a free pair of shoes to a person in need through Soles4Souls, a charity that has distributed over 19 million pairs of shoes in over 130 countries around the world.

When the cycle is complete, it becomes a fresh start for you and your new colleague and a new beginning for a person in need. And don't worry—you won't be violating any gift-acceptance policies. Nothing of value is left behind once the shoes are returned to their headquarters.

Attracting attention while making a positive difference has never been easier. So, step up! Visit and make an impression that goes further than ever thought possible.

Branding discussion: Developing a brand persona - Part I,"People who love their brands have an emotional attachment to them that’s almost impossible to match.  Give an Apple enthusiast a Samsung Galaxy to play with, and watch him politely decline to try the $700 phone.  Whether it’s Target for reliability and quality, Neiman Marcus for luxury goods, or JetBlue for affordable airfare, people stick to brands when there’s trust and loyalty between the brand and the consumer.

But how can a marketer with a new product, service or feature create and instill brand loyalty and a brand persona into its users?  After all, the business owner is typically working in a competitive landscape – while the brand may offer a superior product, the business owner unfortunately still must rise above the noise to get potential customers to convert to loyalists.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">Brand strategists</a> have discovered that they can do this through creating a strong, unique brand persona.  By addressing a few key concerns, they can rise above others in the field to establish a strong brand presence, as well as a loyal customer base.
<h3>Tips from Our Florida Advertising Agency</h3>
Here are some tips from the pros at our <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">Orlando marketing agency</a> that business owners can try in order to help create a strong brand identity:

<strong>Know Your Audience</strong>: Truly understanding your audience is two-fold.  Data helps provide insights about your target demographic – perhaps they are female  smartphone owners, aged 25-35, who enjoy cooking.  But once you know your audience based on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">consumer insights</a>, you might simply begin to develop gut instincts about them.  There’s a fine line between giving your consumers what they want based on your analytic data, and giving them features and services they love that they didn’t know they wanted.

<strong>Create an Ideal Customer</strong>:  If mom-to-be Hannah Jones, who lives at home with her husband in a middle class home in the suburbs is your ideal client, then perhaps you’re doing yourself a disservice by heavily marketing in urban areas.  Our Florida advertising agency warns against attracting customers that are not ideal, you may also damage your business by potentially causing dilution of the brand name. Take some tips from the brand Airwalk, which <a href=""http://smartketingreflections.blogspot.com/2009/11/lessons-from-airwalk.html#.UNHguLZGi2U"">quickly fell downhill</a> once it stopped making its line of specialty shoes aimed toward teenage skateboarders and available only at specialty stores, and accidentally began reaching the thrift consumer instead.

<strong>Know Your Product</strong>:  If you’ve developed a high-end service for luxury watch owners, then chances are that your brand voice doesn’t need to seem as though it’s wired on Mountain Dew.  Instead, look closely at the types of publications and blogs that cater to your ideal customer, and review them to learn about what’s popular with your demographic in the moment.  If your product doesn’t seem to be an appropriate fit with your target, then you may need to pivot your business or your strategy in order to keep in line with what your target needs.

Once you’ve addressed these items, you can then begin to create your own brand persona.  Part II of this article offers ways in which you can begin to develop a campaign around your target consumer.

Part II is coming tomorrow...

Part II – Creating a campaign around your brand identity,"Once you’ve figured out your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand identity</a>, it is essential to determine how to move forward with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a> that strategically addresses your target consumer.  While the types of campaigns you can run are as varied as the types of businesses themselves, you can use some of our tips to help you design something that works efficiently and effectively to help target your ideal consumer.

<strong>Go Where Your Audience Is</strong>:  Think you know your audience, and that they’re all on Facebook?  You may be mistaken.  These days, Pinterest is extremely popular with adult women, while male geek-types may use Reddit more than Twitter.  Some children even view Facebook as something that only their parents use – certainly, no 12-year-old wants to hang out where his mom hangs out.  If you don’t know where to find your target consumer, it’s imperative to find out before you develop a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media campaign</a>.

<strong>Keep Your Expectations Realistic</strong>:  If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my years as a strategist, it’s that no one can <em>make</em> a video go viral.  This is particularly true if it doesn’t reach a person on an emotional level, such as through humor or heart.  If you think simply telling someone about your product or service in a video will garner millions of views, it’s important to review your strategy.  Instead, consider what will appeal to your audience, and market toward their emotions.

<strong>Remember the Brand Power of a Comprehensive Campaign</strong>:  Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Twitter strategy</a> is getting tons of interaction, and your Instagram account gets hundreds of “likes” every time.  But something still seems amiss in terms of success.  What’s going on?

Perhaps it’s first important to address whether there is a clear call to action established within the context of the campaign.  If the goal is to get new followers, then reaching out to the people on Twitter who already follow your company doesn’t do much good.  In order to create the best interactive campaign you can create, our Orlando ad agency advises you to find ways to efficiently integrate several multimedia platforms if possible.  You can talk about your Instagram photo contest on Twitter and sync it with Facebook, or you can create a TV ad with a clear call to action to ask people to follow you on your various social media accounts.  Carefully consider the medium, the message and the desired goal.

<strong>Keep It Agile</strong>:  Even amazing ideas may fail sometimes (remember Friendster, the precursor to MySpace [which was the precursor to Facebook]?).  But, if you’ve formulated a strategy that you can pivot as it takes shape, you’re far ahead of your competition and, in some cases, can prevent major PR disasters should your plan go awry.

<strong>Learn From Mistakes</strong>:  Every single company in the world makes mistakes from time to time, and often these mistakes involve failed marketing strategies.  Examine what went wrong, and what you could do differently.  Even in the case of a successful campaign, it is important to examine the results in order to help duplicate success in the future.

A Face(book) only a mother could love: How social are moms?,"When Facebook first began, it was a tool for students to connect with one another, typically within a limited age range of about 20-30.  Later, when Zuckerberg opened up the Facebook forum to people of all ages, more people learned about the value of reaching out to one another using what is now the world’s largest social network.  What was once seen as cool and limited to a select group of people who were “in the know” became open to everyone.  A college student would cringe to open up his friend requests to see, smiling back at him, an image of his own mother.

But these days, it’s the norm for mothers of all types to connect with their children and with other moms using Facebook, Twitter and other popular social networks.  As women are seeing the benefits of technology, more of them are also investing in tablets and smart phones, which provide ways for them to stay connected.

Facebook is a revolutionary tool for mothers, who often post pictures of their children and families to share with friends.  In fact, many young mothers make their living from blogging and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">working remotely in social fields</a>, as doing so allows them the flexibility to stay home with their children while still allowing them to earn a living.  Older mothers have found the value of using Facebook to help them stay connected to business contacts.

[quote]For advertisers, moms are a highly coveted demographic, as they are often the ones who have the power to make purchasing decisions for items such as diaper brands, video games, and children’s cereals, among other things.  [/quote]It seems like a no-brainer that these mothers would engage in significant social sharing activity – through social networking sites, they stay connected.

At a recent <a href=""http://www.blogher.com/"">BlogHer</a> conference sponsored by a number of mommy-friendly companies like Diet Pepsi and Johnson &amp; Johnson, hundreds of moms got together to discuss trends in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media and digital networking</a>.  These aren’t your traditional soccer moms – many of these moms were urban professionals who make a living in the digital media industry, networking to reach out to other moms to create and maintain a community.

Sites like <a href=""http://www.babble.com/"">Babble.com</a> cater to what they call “a new generation of parents,” writing articles with <a href=""http://blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/2012/11/13/18-ways-to-keep-yourself-feeling-sexy-during-a-dry-spell/"">titles</a> like “18 Ways to Keep Yourself Feeling Sexy During a Dry Spell.”  In essence, this ain’t your mama’s website…. Except actually, it is!

So, back to the core question – how social are moms?  In a word, incredibly.  <a href=""http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/getting-to-know-and-like-the-social-mom/"">Neilsen reports</a> that moms are some of the biggest influencers out there, and use social media to stay connected to one another.  They are:

- 81 percent more likely to become a fan of or follow a brand online

- 86 percent more likely to post a status update

- 84 percent more likely to comment or post content than the general population.

Of course, there may be demographic shifts due to the age of the parent, location, household income and a host of other factors.  But, the mother of one four-year-old I know has hundreds of connections on LinkedIn, due at least partially due to her propensity to use LinkedIn as a networking tool to help her grow her small business.

As social media continues to grow and expand, so too will the ways in which mothers reach out to one another through social media.

How advertising is like parenting pour three-year-old kid,"When you’re three, you don’t know much.  The world around you is an amazing stimulus of glittery, shiny and bright things, just waiting for you to touch them and explore them.  As adults, when people are subject to advertisements and promotions, they experience marketing in the same way.  Good marketing makes people impulsively want to reach out for things, try new products and seek new experiences.

Like a good parent, the marketer’s goal is then to push the person in the right direction.  We make hundreds of choices each day about where to eat, what fabric softener to use, and what type of chair looks best in the dining room.  Though we may not realize it, it’s marketing exposure that allows us to make informed choices.

But children are unpredictable sometimes, as are consumers.  Ask a group of well-educated adults what they want in a smart phone, and you’ll get a host of complicated features.  Apple’s Steve Jobs took it upon himself to dismiss focus groups and instead to create the features that people didn’t know they wanted yet... applications, web browsing features, music, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a> and, most importantly, efficient <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">design</a>.

Around age three, a child learns how to identify with a group.  While this tendency is most pronounced in young children, the fundamental learnings they take home during that time stay true well into adulthood.  These attitudes are the same ones we fall back upon when we identify with groups as adults.  Nike capitalizes on the people who identify as athletes, designing products suited toward athletic lifestyles and even engaging in content marketing directed toward that group.  Throughout our lives, we’re constantly evolving and identifying with our favorite brands, purchasing Apple products or showing a preference for Pepsi over Coke.  Our perceptions of our own identities evolve as we grow to learn more about the world around us.  Advertisers can latch on to this concept to sell us their products at every stage of our lives.

Parenting is hard, and in the way that children trust their parents, consumers trust advertisers and marketers to point them into the right direction.  [quote]Marketers strive to make that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">meaningful connection to their consumers</a>, much in the way that parents strive to see the world in the way that a child can understand.  [/quote]Consumers reciprocate when they find brands reliable and trustworthy.

For advertisers and marketers, the realization that our client base may not fully understand the science behind the marketing of the good or service means that we have the ability to teach them.  We can also grow with them, and can learn from their mistakes.  But, in any case, the brand is the guide – at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we believe that a successful brand will teach consumers to comprehend new products or ways of thinking, or to experience existing products or services in an emotionally-connected way.

The team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> wants to remind you that the next time you receive criticism from a client, or you experience surprising or even erratic behavior from consumers, it’s important to step back from your consumers and instead view them from a parental perspective.  They trust you, and they’ll lash out against you, but if you’re able to build trust and respect within the relationship, you’re able to nurture a healthy, long-lasting relationship.

The business of social media: Do you still need a sales team?,"With <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, individuals and small businesses have the power to reach thousands of people in mere seconds.  Our smartphones and computers allow us to reach anyone in almost any part of the world in less time than it takes to warm a microwave burrito.  Business contacts, colleagues, associates, consumers – they’re all right there at the tips of our fingertips.

So that leaves some members of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> wondering, what’s the point of your sales team if you can broker sales through effective use of social media?  The “push” sales strategy may be losing its place in a “pull” culture, where people go online to seek out only the information that they need in order to formulate an opinion as to the products or services that they find valuable.  [quote]Through social media, people can buy items with just a few clicks, which in some cases could virtually eliminate the need for a costly sales team.[/quote]

While it may seem tempting to save thousands of dollars each year by pink-slipping your entire sales team, I’d instead argue that the role of the salesman has changed.  Individuals have been very successful in pushing their products through online sales, so perhaps for companies such as cell phone retailers, the benefit to a so-called sales team is to offer potential consumers opportunities to demo products and explain services, and to provide customer service when people have issues.

Sales teams will almost always remain important in fields where connecting online may not be the best or most practical option.  Perhaps your desired audience may not be tech savvy, or isn’t as plugged in as most of the world.  Though it seems as though everyone you know has a smartphone, as of a year ago, <a href=""http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/smartphones-account-for-half-of-all-mobile-phones-dominate-new-phone-purchases-in-the-us/"">only ½ of the United States’ mobile phone owners had one</a>.

Your sales team can be beneficial if you arm them with the tools to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">properly use social media to their advantage</a>.  <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/features/social_media"">Video programs</a> are offered by executive training companies such as McKinsey, as well as online courses from top continuing education institutes on how people can properly use social media in either a B to B or B to C sales capacity.  These classes can teach about the benefits of using Facebook and Twitter to connect with people who may provide valuable resources for your company, and can teach your employees to seek out potential buyers and distributors through LinkedIn.

Returning to the original question, does your company still need a sales team?  Maybe not!  Certainly, it’s contingent upon your industry.  But, for those of you in fields reliant upon tech, it may be beneficial to hire a social media expert to help you master the art of sales through social media.  Additionally, offering opportunities and incentives for social sharing may help drive your company’s bottom line through active use of social media.

While <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> doesn’t suggest that you immediately get rid of your entire sales team, we do suggest that you teach them strategies to use social media in a professional capacity to help build sales and increase revenue through social media.  We imagine a future where all business sales come from the relationships established and maintained through the use of social media.

<strong>It’s All About the Hog</strong>

By Justin Ollivierre Posted on January 30, 2013

<em>Groundhog Day</em>

Phil emerges from his hole every year on February 2nd in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Punxsutawney Phil first predicted the weather 127 years ago. Punxsutawney Phil was named after King Phillip. Prior to being called Phil, he was called Br’er Groundhog. According to the legend, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, there will be 6 more weeks of winter weather. If he does not see his shadow, there will be an early spring. Crowds of around 40,000 gather in Punxsutawney, PA every February 2nd to celebrate the holiday. Groundhog Day lore suggests that Punxsutawney Phil drinks a magic elixir every summer, which gives him 7 more years of life. Punxsutawney Phil has seen his shadow 99 times, has not seen it 16 times, and 9 years are unaccounted for.

Punxsutawney Phil is 22 inches long and weighs 20 pounds. Most groundhogs in the wild are rarely heavier than 12 pounds. When groundhogs awake after hibernation in February, they will have lost almost half of their body weight. A maximum age of 14 years has been documented for groundhogs in captivity. An average groundhog removes over 700 pounds of dirt to dig his burrow-that’s roughly the size of a small adult cow! Groundhogs whistle when alarmed and when they begin courting. Groundhog litters consist of 4 to 9 babies known at kits or cubs.

The National Climatic Data Center has stated that Phil’s predictions have been correct 39% of the time...while Phil’s club claims he’s been right 100% of the time. Punxsutawney Phil can now text you his weather prediction. Text “Groundhog” to 247365 on Groundhog Day.",,1/30/2013 9:30,37,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Its-all-about-the-hog.jpg,its-all-about-the-hog-infographic,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Four important Facebook tips for hospital marketers,"Hospital marketers face challenges unique to their profession.  Marketing often entails informing the public of staff accomplishments, explaining new physician services, or simply <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">building awareness within the community</a>.  Successful hospital marketers integrate both <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">digital strategies</a> and direct contact within their locale.  Such hospitals may also need to focus on hosting events and building direct relationships with their patients.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a>, we typically advise hospital marketers to treat their Facebook pages as extensions of their community marketing.  While marketing should always be about the people, hospital marketers should be particularly inclined to build relationships in order to maintain lasting physician-patient relationships.  [quote] Hospital marketers must also account for the needs and desires of the physicians they service, whom we often see pushing marketers toward more publicity-related roles. [/quote]

<a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook </a>can be an excellent tool to help facilitate these relationships.  Below are some tips for hospital marketers to use to help get the most out of Facebook marketing.

<strong>Keep It Positive</strong>:  Facebook is designed to foster a positive environment, which is allegedly why there’s a “like” feature but not a “dislike” feature.  Posting good news about patient recoveries, information about recent awards and news about new procedures help keep your patients and followers engaged and excited about your work within the community.

<strong>Post a Photo</strong>:  What’s cuter than posting a birth announcement featuring an adorable sleeping infant?  Just make sure you have the adequate permissions before posting anything that might infringe on individuals’ privacy.

<strong>Create an Infographic</strong>:  Want to try to explain a new service in detail?  Use an infographic to relay important information about how the service will provide benefits to patients.  Make sure that any data that you use in your infographic is verified and footnoted, and you’ll not only secure your team leaders within your community, but will also solidify your expert knowledge of patient services.

<strong>Involve Your Employees</strong>: Facebook marketing doesn’t necessarily mean sticking to providing information about day-to-day hospital operations.  Instead, humanize your brand with information about the staff, including everyone from surgeons to administrative staff to the marketers themselves.  Reaching out to your staff in this way may also encourage sharing behavior on your staff’s pages – plus, who doesn’t like to be recognized for their contributions?

As hospital marketers know, there are important legal restrictions in terms of hospital marketing.  Legal counsel often requires legal waivers and consent forms from anyone whose identifying information they may post online.  Hospital marketers should hold themselves to the highest standard of integrity in this capacity, as hospitals have extensive access to highly sensitive confidential materials.  Any new Facebook marketing initiative should undergo legal review in order to prevent the possibility of legal complications.

That said, there are still plenty of fun ways for hospitals to use Facebook.  For more ideas as to how hospital marketers can use social media to help create innovative marketing campaigns, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">reach out to our Florida advertising agency</a> to help you create an intelligent, interactive Facebook campaign.",,1/21/2013 9:39,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/The-face-of-your-hospital.jpg,four-tips-facebook-tips-for-hospital-marketers,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
BIGEYE's Video Production: Annika Sorenstam & Arnold Palmer video,"As a part of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, an Orlando <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production company</a>, we are very proud to have the <a href=""http://www.orlandohealth.com/arnoldpalmerhospital/"">Arnold Palmer Hospital For Children</a> as one of our notable clients. They are viewed as the leader in pediatric care in Central Florida. In 2006, the Arnold Palmer Hospital decided to specialize its care for women and children by opening up the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies. In 2012, we ran a campaign that highlighted one athlete’s intimate experience with the Winnie Palmer Hospital.

In our society, it’s difficult to imagine superstars facing real life struggles. They lead very public lives and most of the time are viewed as almost superhuman. It’s important to remember that even though they might not face day-to-day struggles like you and me, they are still human beings. The athlete highlighted in this campaign is Annika Sorenstam, one of the LPGA tours most legendary golfers. In this video, Annika opens up about the complications she faced during her second pregnancy.

The video begins by highlighting some of Annika’s biggest achievements on the golf course. Shortly after, the film cuts to Annika and her husband, Mike, discussing that no matter how accomplished she has been on the golf course, starting a family has been her ultimate proudest moment. She then discusses how one Sunday night during her second trimester, everything changed. She woke up in the middle of the night to bloody sheets, which she later learned was caused by placenta abruption. Mike raced her to the hospital where she had an emergency C-section. Annika thoughtfully remembers that amidst the chaos that night, the nurses and doctors of the Winnie Palmer hospital remained calm and reassuring. Once their premature son was born, they recalled how strong and determined he was to fight for his life. They fittingly named him Will, because he had the will to get better. Neonatologist Dr. Michael McMahan was interviewed explaining how 95% of the babies that are born that severely premature end up living a normal and healthy life. Towards the end of the video, Annika, Mike and their two children were interviewed with Arnold Palmer, who is the benefactor of Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies. Annika explains how the Winnie Palmer staff were so incredibly caring and thoughtful. Mike calls the staff their “angels, because all they do is save lives.” Arnold Palmer then reflects on the Winnie Palmer Hospital staff and discusses how many lives have been changed for the better.

William Nicholas McGee was born via c-section on March 21, 2011 after Annika suffered a placenta abruption at just 27 weeks along. He arrived weighing 2.12 lbs and measuring 15 inches long. He was born 13 weeks early. Placenta abruption is the separation of the placenta from the uterine lining. The placenta is part of a baby’s life support. It transfers oxygen and nutrients to the baby. When the placenta separates, it can interrupt the transportation of oxygen and nutrients to your baby. Only about 1% of all pregnant women will experience placenta abruption and most cases can be successfully treated.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video shoot was very complex</a>. The camera used is known as a ‘red camera’. It has the ability to shoot ‘4 K raw footage’ which allows the film to obtain double the amount of pixels. In a way, it’s almost like using two cameras. This camera is extremely high end and our video team describes the style of the type of footage captured “similar to the footage in The Hobbit.”

The Write Way: Six tips for better email marketing,"In some ways, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> is a necessary evil.  It’s a cheap and efficient way to reach all of your former customers, colleagues, subscribers and anyone else that’s randomly ended on your list.  It’s today’s version of direct mail marketing—only worse, in that it’s so cheap that nearly every company in existence can afford to do it.

If you find your company’s marketing emails struggling to distinguish themselves from that Nigerian prince who keeps asking you to send him money, then perhaps its time to reevaluate your email.  Here are some tips to help you pack the most punch with a single message:

<strong>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):</strong>  You may have the urge to pack your email full of stories, articles and news in order to make sure the subscriber knows everything.  But edit your message, and think about what the reader sees… does he really need to know that your friend’s mother’s brother saw Les Miserables and thought it was “pretty good?”  Cut out all of the extraneous information and focus on the important selling points.  If you want to offer news and about your company (and you probably do), offer short snippets and link out to full web pages and blog posts that explore the information in more detail.

<strong>Make the Email Part of the Marketing:</strong> Are you in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">business of design</a>, yet for some reason you send text-based emails?  In doing this, you dilute your message of innovation, no matter what types of services you provide.  However, it is important to note that some companies tend to stick to tech because some email applications, such as Gmail.com, do not automatically show images.  Account for this by naming your images accordingly so that the picture titles show up automatically, and do so in a manner that helps prompt people to click the option to open all emails from your given email address in the future.  Then, you can focus on ways to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">integrate your brand identity with your email design</a>.

<strong>Use Catchy Subject Lines:</strong> This may seem obvious, but it’s surprising how many emails I get on a daily basis with titles like “January Newsletter” and “Blog Update.”  Unless these are from companies I rely on to provide me with relevant information, I immediately delete these kinds of messages.  Think carefully about what your readers want to hear about – is it a sale? A giveaway?  Maybe a piece of advice you know they’ll use?  If possible, come up with something catchy and use it as a lead-in to your email message, which will lead to significantly higher open rates.

<strong>Include a Call to Action: </strong> If you’re able to get your reader to read through your newsletter, bulletin or sale information, why not use the opportunity to encourage them to also “like” your Facebook page or follow you on Twitter?  In doing so, you can get double the impact out of your email message.

[quote]

A call to action? You don’t say? Since we’re on the subject, why don’t you go ahead and like our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BIGEYEagency"">Facebook page </a>and follow us on <a href=""https://twitter.com/bigeyeagency"">Twitter</a>. You’ll be glad you did.

[/quote]

<strong>Optimize Your Email for Mobile:</strong>  This seems like a no-brainer, but so many companies these days still haven’t fully latched on to the fact that millions of Americans use their phones as their primary source of email viewing.  People check from their phones or tablets early in the morning to see what they missed overnight, and they continue to check throughout the day when they are away from their computers.  If people can’t see your messages, those messages will likely go down the tube into oblivion with thousands of other jumbled emails that people like you and me see daily.

<strong>Avoid Spamming Your List:</strong> Email glut is a reality these days.  In writing and sending emails, remember that you are asking for a piece of your subscriber’s time.  If you fail to offer interesting and informative information, your potential customer will hit unsubscribe faster than you can check your inbox.

Email lists are extraordinarily valuable to businesses of all sizes, and it is important to remember that every email is a potential sale.  Use the kind of courtesy in a marketing email that you would in a friendly email.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida marketing agency</a> is certain that if you use these tips, you’ll notice immediate returns.",,1/22/2013 10:00,13,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Six-Tips-for-Better-Email-Marketing.jpg,six-tips-for-better-email-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
BIGEYE volunteers help out at the Orlando rescue mission,"On the Monday before Thanksgiving the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> team piled up in our cars and headed over to the <a href=""http://www.ourm.org"">Orlando Rescue Mission</a>. We had the privilege to tour the facility and see some of the amazing things that are going on there. The Orlando Rescue Mission is one of the oldest and largest homeless service providers in Central Florida. Their programs are designed to lead the homeless to permanent independence as well as providing for immediate needs.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> volunteered in the kitchen and served a delicious lunch to the residents and staff of the Orlando Rescue Mission. We had a great time in fellowship and helping to provide a smile and a warm meal for those in need.

BIGEYE volunteers at The Mustard Seed of Central Florida,"The Mustard Seed of Central Florida has a humble beginning. The donation-based service was established in 1984 at a time when homelessness was just beginning to emerge as a community-wide endemic. Carol Kane, the founder, saw all homeless individuals, regardless of race, creed, or social status, simply as God’s children in need of assistance. The Mustard Seed became a non-profit, charitable organization as a result of her faith.

The mission of The Mustard Seed Furniture and Clothing Bank is to help to rebuild the lives of families and individuals who have suffered disaster or personal tragedy by providing household furnishings and clothing while being environmentally responsible to our community.

What’s special about The Mustard Seed is that a majority of the help they receive is voluntary. So what did we do? We volunteered! We arrived bright and early with coffee in hand, and after a tour of the facility and many, many thanks from the Volunteer Coordinator, we were split into small teams and we got to work!

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> really dug in… we opened up television sets and extracted all of the usable copper. We sorted through and organized donated clothing and pieces of material. We hung clothes in the store that’s open to the public each week. And we helped create dish packs that would provide a family of four with the necessary plates, cups, and silverware.

While we didn’t get a chance to meet any of the families that The Mustard Seed provides hope and help for, we left knowing that our donation of time would make a difference in the lives of those who need help in our community.

"New year, New plan: Resolve to revamp your strategy in 2013","I’m not always one for resolutions, but this year sees more reasons for change.  In 2012, we saw what a major role social media and digital strategy played in the presidential election – many people have gone on the record to say that one of the primary reasons for Romney’s defeat was the <a href=""http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/social-and-anti-social-media/"">lack of an integrated digital campaign strategy</a>.  Regardless of whether that’s true, it speaks to the profound implications that an effective <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a> might have on your business.

So this year, I’ve decided to make it my personal resolution to help impress the importance of a digital strategy on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando ad agency</a> clients, as well as all of our friends in the advertising and marketing world.  It can be difficult to keep up with all of the new trends and ideas.  Two years ago, daily deals were the future of Internet marketing, while today, businesses like <a href=""https://www.livingsocial.com/"">LivingSocial</a> and <a href=""https://www.groupon.com/"">Groupon</a> are tanking.

This is why we consider it essential for businesses of all sizes to reassess their digital strategy to help grow their businesses through marketing in 2013.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Orlando marketing agency</a> strives to provide our clients with successful <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">digital marketing strategies</a> on budgets of any size.

Our first tip is to remember to invest in marketing, but know how to do so wisely.  Generating a flashy marketing campaign won’t be worth the effort if the product can’t stand on its own.  We encourage you to work with a strategist or consultant who truly understands the intricacies of successful digital media.  Companies that have taken the plunge to invest a few dollars in professional marketing typically see high returns for the money spent.

Next, companies should invest resources in learning how to leverage social media.  As we’ve noted in the past, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//blog/why-college-students-shouldnt-handle-social-media/"">a college student</a> might not be the best person to run your social media platform.  Smaller companies can resolve to use social media to their advantage, encouraging people to Tweet at them for the opportunity to win new products or encouraging them to share information in order to receive discount promo codes.

Finally, and most importantly, we urge you to resolve to continue to consider the end user.  Sure, you want to sell products, but think of the ways that your company might alienate users when you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">constantly send emails</a>, overselling them on products or services that they might otherwise love.  While we’re not telling you to that marketing strategy is completely organic and reliant upon word-of-mouth, we do encourage you to carefully seed your strategy, and to allow it to take off from there.  Carefully review customer data to find out what people love about your brand, and use that information to develop plans that speak directly to your customer.

Above all, resolve to create a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy</a> that puts your customer first, thereby empowering you to extend your company’s resources to create the solid foundation for an invigorating digital strategy in the new year.

Patients are a virtue: A look into hospital marketing,"Hospital marketers are in a tough position when it comes to pleasing physicians.  Doctors, surgeons and specialists typically have years and years of expertise, and often believe that their ideas and personas warrant marketing and publicity recognition.  Many times, this is true – a long list of award-winning services may entice people to choose your hospital’s services over another’s.

However, at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we’ve noticed that physicians and other hospital service staff are quick to jump on opportunities to recognize their own accomplishments, but sometimes neglect outreach efforts to potential and returning patients.  Hospital marketers may find it difficult to strike the balance between pleasing physicians and engaging in effective outreach.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team members at our agency</a> recently wrote a white paper titled <em>Marketing to Mee</em><em>t Hospital Business Objectives While Keeping Physicians Happy</em>, addressing how hospital marketers can effectively please hospital physicians while also meeting their own marketing objectives.  We suggested that there should be dual service lines; one of which addresses the needs of the physicians, and another other that involves creating marketing objectives at the executive level and analyzing the success of such initiatives.

There are entire industries dedicated to physician reputation management, which encourages physicians to find effective ways to tout their accomplishments, particularly against any potential negative publicity.  But hospital marketers must remember that, while marketing to maintain physicians’ reputations is important, it is but a single slice of the pie.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">At our Florida marketing agency</a>, we believe that hospital marketing will see greater success with marketing toward patients.  In this digital era, there are numerous ways to reach out to potential patients, and many of these methods may not involve touting the merits of your hospital’s physicians and staff.

In engaging in effective hospital marketing, you are trying to persuade potential patients to believe in your message, and to think of your organization first when they are sick or injured.  In order to do this, each piece of content you create should be in service of your audience.  What is your hospital staff doing to differentiate itself?  Why are your hospital’s services better than a competitor’s?

Notice how a strategy that emphasizes these efforts aims to reach the potential patients at an emotional level.  These efforts tend to work much better than efforts that simply offer a long list of physician credentials.  One way to frame the difference is, rather than asking whether the physicians are happy with marketing efforts or whether the efforts are serving the needs of the hospital as a brand, to ask whether the efforts are serving the needs of potential patients and of the community as a whole.

If your hospital marketing is struggling to reach patients in a meaningful way, perhaps it is time to revaluate your strategy to put more emphasis on patient needs.  Go to where they are, find out what they’re seeking and speak to them on their terms.  While meeting the needs of physicians is important, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> believes it is even more important to meet the needs of the patients who will keep coming back, year after year. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact us</a> for more information, we'd love to help!",,1/24/2013 9:52,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Patients-are-a-Virtue-Hospital-Marketing-Should-Be-About-the-Patient.jpg,patients-are-a-virtue-hospital-marketing-should-be-about-the-patient,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Etsy: Hipster Crafting Haven and Marketing Smarty,"Launched in the summer of 2005, <a href=""http://etsty.com"">Etsy</a>, the purveying marketplace for hipster crafts, generated more than $2.4 billion in gross merchandise sales, had 1.6 million active sellers, and 24 million active buyers in 2015. I think it's safe to say this New York based crafting empire must be doing something right within its <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing and advertising strategies</a>.

Aside from their inadvertent marketing from its members who are simply promoting their personal online shops, Etsy has made major strides in its marketing strategies. With heavy social media outreach, transparent blogging techniques, on location pop-up shops and craft labs – Etsy will continue to grow its seller and customer base.

As a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida marketing agency</a>, we find inspiration for our own strategies everywhere including a million dollar arts and craft mogul like Etsy. Take some cues from this savvy craftzilla company and some of their marketing and advertising strategies:

<strong>Be a social media powerhouse</strong> – From Twitter and Facebook to Pinterest and Tumblr, their social media empire is ever growing.

They have a strong online presence and are excited to tell the world about their crafty goodness. Have a “show and tell” of your own and represent your company on the social front.

 	<li>Tweet daily updates about new products or office happenings.</li>
 	<li>Connect directly with customers on Facebook and share images and links from your blog posts, shop windows or product.</li>
 	<li>Share some creative inspiration on Pinterest and add a PinIt button to your website or blog to optimize others to share your content.</li>
 	<li>Create a youtube channel and engage customers on a more personable level. Let them see your face, hear your voice, and learn a bit more about the company they are doing business with.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Focus on your local community with on-location <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/community/events"">events</a></strong> – This holiday, Etsy featured a craft pop-up shop in the trendy NY neighborhood of SoHo. Featuring celebrity artists, craft workshops and more; they even curated a hand painted wall mural above the shop. Outside of the holidays, Etsy hosts free monthly workshops out of their office lab. Let your customers experience your personal hospitality and get to know them face to face with an in-store event or a social night.

<strong>Think of your mobile users </strong>– [quote]More than 50% of Etsy visitors are viewing the site from mobile devices.[/quote] Launching its first iPhone App in November 2011, Etsy reached over 100 million downloads in just four months from its release date. You may not need to go to the extreme of building an app for your business, but you should consider developing a separate mobile site to enhance your online presence or at least take steps to make your site a bit more mobile-friendly.­­

<strong>Promotional ads and content to drive traffic</strong>– Etsy supplies their members with promo <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/2012/promote-holiday-sales-with-shop-badges-coupons-and-social-media/"">badges</a> to support their personal Etsy shops which in turn encourages more visits to Etsy.com and increases overall revenue for the company. A great way to bolster your advertising promotions is researching new publishers that share interest with your customer base (blogs, websites and social sites) that offer ad space. Many offer affordable advertising packages to post small ads  that can drive more traffic to your site and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">awareness about your company</a>.

"SEO: Search engine optimization, aka how to be #1 online","<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> stands for Search Engine Optimization. In other words, this is how you get your name to the top of the list. Not just any list, but <em>the </em>list, the one people rely on for quality solutions to their everyday problems. Now, who doesn’t want that? With search engines such as Google driving as much as 80% of todays Internet traffic, SEO is essential to setting your website within the view of potential visitors. But before we get into some details of SEO, let’s talk about search engines.
<h3>Search Engines.</h3>
Search engines perform two major functions. They <em>crawl</em> the Internet and provide answers. In the <em>crawling, </em>or mapping, process, the search engine explores billions, yes billions, of pages and creates references. Relevant content is stored within databases, patiently waiting to be recalled upon for future searches. When the search engine provides answers, results are displayed based upon relevance and importance.  These dimensions are measured by complex algorithms, which ultimately determine the ranking of websites.
<h3>Think popularity.</h3>
Contrary to what most of us are taught, popularity, at least in this case, is everything. Popularity equates to importance. The search engine assumes that the more popular the website, the more valuable the information; a method that has proven to be quite successful.
<h3>Design &amp; Development</h3>
There are several elements to keep in mind when optimizing a website. Primarily, there is content. Containing HTML text on the page enables search engines to read through and index the information. Want to see what the search engine sees? Google’s Cache, <a href=""http://www.SEO-browser.com"">SEO-browser</a> and <a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/seo-toolbar"">MozBar</a> are some helpful tools to let you do just that.

Then there is the link structure. Search engines navigate pages through the most available pathway, often traveling through links. It’s important to remember to properly link the pages of your website. Otherwise, the search engine will not recognize any of the pages left out, regardless of its relevance and importance.

Keywords are another element of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>. The results of a search are based on the words entered within the search box, including their spelling, punctuation, and even capitalization. When a word is entered in the box, the search engine finds a relevant database, ranks the documents and then returns a list of results; a pretty big job for less than a second of work. One of the best ways to optimize pages is to include key words in the titles, text and meta data of a website. More specific key words increase the chance of ranking higher. This is due to the fact that more specific key words provide less competition. Search engine optimization can also be improved with the adjustment of other elements such as title tags, meta tags, URL structure, duplicate content and rich snippets.

As a Florida advertising agency, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> practices and encourages SEO. Everyday, people are using search engines to navigate their way through the Internet. This an opportunity to make your website and your business more accessible to the visitor. When an individual types a query into their search box and the name of your business appears near the top of the first page, there is an intangible quality about it. There’s that comforting sense of reassurance that your business is the right one.

The Complete Idiot’s Guide To Search Engine Optimization,"If you’re like me, you pretend to be “in the know” on all things digital. I’m not saying that I don’t “try” to fully understand; it’s just a bit confusing at times. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a> is one of those digital concepts that I just couldn’t quite get a grasp on. So to save you hours of research, I have pulled together a plethora of information that describes the concept of SEO and basic tips to help you capitalize on this marketing strategy.
<h3>What is SEO?</h3>
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of affecting the visibility of a website in a search engine’s “organic” (unpaid) search results. The concept behind this strategy is to find ways to increase your site’s appearance in web visitors’ search results. [quote] In laymen’s terms, SEO is an Internet marketing strategy that, if used correctly, will drive more traffic to your site. [/quote]
<h3>A Florida Advertising Agency helping you capitalize using SEO:</h3>
1.)       <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Monitor Your Current Standing</span>

Before you change anything on your site, see where you already stand with your visitors. Use tools, such as <a href=""http://www.alexa.com/"">Alexa</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/toolbar/ie/index.html"">Google Toolbar</a>, to check out your page rank. Make it a habit of regularly checking your referrer log, which will give you insight into where your visitors are coming from and the search terms they’re using to find your site.

2.)       <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Be Conscious of Keywords</span>

Sprinkle appropriate keywords throughout every aspect of your site. These aspects include: titles, content, URLs and image names. According to <em>Business Insider, </em>“the title tag and page header are the two most important spots to put keywords.” Be strategic in where you place keywords because you don’t want to overdue it. Search engine spiders, which are programs that automatically fetch Web pages and feed them to search engines, are programmed to ignore sites guilty of “keyword-stuffing”.

3.)       <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Always Link Back to Yourself</span>

The most basic strategy to increase your site’s traffic is the integration of internal links into your site. Make it a habit to frequently link back to your archives when creating new content for your site. As I stated above, don’t overdue it. The last thing you want to do is spam your readers with an annoying amount of links.

4.)       <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Keep Your Content Fresh </span>

The $3.5 Million Question: Why Superbowl Ads Are On the Money,"Here’s a list of things that cost $3.5 million:

<a href=""http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2011/story/_/id/7544243/super-bowl-2012-commercials-cost-average-35m"">One Thirty-Second Advertising Spot During the Superbowl</a>

When considering what else you can get for $3.5 million a Superbowl ad may not seem as alluring as a gorgeous new mansion.  But, it’s probably at least as good of an investment as Lena Dunham’s book deal (in order to recoup, she’ll have to sell as many copies of her book as Tina Fey’s best-seller <em>Bossypants </em>has sold to date).  And, as much as we love the business of business, I doubt Warren himself would approve of spending $3.5 just to eat some caviar with him when you can read an interview on the Internet for free.

A 30-second Superbowl spot offers almost unlimited business growth opportunity. In 2012, 111.3 million people watched the Giants defeat the Patriots. The magic of the Superbowl is that is appeals to a broad demographic, which is why advertisers don’t bat an eye at spending such excessive sums. Men, women, children and teens all watch – some of them watch just to see the commercials.

But what other television event do people watch <em>just to see the commercials</em>? Make a truly funny one, and in addition to 111.3 million impressions, it can lead to thousands of interactions on Twitter and Facebook, and can garner you tons of free publicity in the blogs and newspapers the next day.  Through the commercial itself, you can encourage your visitors to become Twitter followers and to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">like your brand</a> on Facebook for exclusive content.  In theory, your $3.5 million investment could lead to more than 350 million (or more) interactions and impressions – 100 impressions per every single dollar spent on your ad spot.

These days, a Superbowl ad is no longer just an ad.  It’s a marketing opportunity; a way to reach out to a broad demographic through an entire campaign, through which an ad spot is just one outlet.  A Superbowl spot is guaranteed exposure, which not even network television can guarantee in this day of DVR technology (if your Superbowl party host DVRs the game instead of watching it in real time, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> suggests you come to our party next year instead!).

No matter which team you’re rooting for this year, pay close attention to the ad messaging in the commercials.  Which major <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brands message</a> a call to action?  Which entice you to purchase their products, like, now?  And which are utterly forgettable or downright bad?

"Social media’s newest ""it girl"": Welcome the new app Vine","<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Social media</a> is constantly evolving, which means there will always be a new platform that is bigger and better than the existing ones. The newest platform to hit the web is <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vine-make-a-scene/id592447445?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Vine</a>, a Twitter creation. It is an app that allows you to create six-second videos and share them on an Instagram-like newsfeed, Twitter and Facebook. Those six-seconds don’t have to be consecutive. You can start and stop recording by tapping on the screen until your time is up. It is currently only available on an iPhone or an iTouch.

Chris Taylor from Mashable wrote, “It’s the kind of moment that comes rarely, but tech journalists live for it; a service is launched with little fanfare and receives a sudden, energetic burst of genuine buzz.”

It hasn’t been all champagne and roses. The first glitch happened a few days after it’s launch in the appearance of pornography videos. Twitter said in a statement to ABC News, “Users can report videos as inappropriate within the product if they believe the content to be sensitive or inappropriate (e.g. nudity, violence, or medical procedures).” All videos that meet those descriptions will be immediately deleted.

Although there have been early hiccups, our Florida advertising agency believes Vine has a bright future. It has a big advantage as being the brainchild of a major social service, <a href=""http://twitter.com"">Twitter.</a> Have you started using <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vine-make-a-scene/id592447445?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Vine</a> already, or need some expert advice on where to begin? <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact our team</a> today to schedule a consultation!",,2/1/2013 9:35,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Social-Media’s-new-it-girl-Vine.jpg,social-medias-newest-it-girl-vine,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
David Ogilvy on the importance of understanding copywriting,"David Ogilvy was one of the true giants of advertising. His name is often mentioned alongside other advertising legends like Leo Burnett, Bill Bernbach, and Howard Luck Gossage. “The Father of Advertising” or ""the original Mad Man"" as he is known today, founded the agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather in 1948 when he was just 37 years old. Today, it has more than 450 offices in 169 cities.

To get a glimpse into Ogilvy’s genius as a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriter</a>, just take a look at the letter below. It was written to Ray Calt in 1955, outlining Ogilvy’s ""appalling"" copywriting habits. I doubt that Mr. Calt ever expected such a response. But hopefully, he got a good laugh out of it.

I think every copywriter out there can relate to one or a few of the things mentioned in it. I can especially relate to bullet point #9—although rum is often replaced by really strong coffee and Handel on the gramophone is replaced by Jaytech or Blackmill on my Bose noise canceling headphones.

By the way, if you haven’t read Ogilvy’s iconic book “Confessions of an Advertising Man” you’re missing out on one of the most interesting reads in the business, still relevant decades later.

<em>April 19, 1955</em>

<em>Dear Mr. Calt:</em>

<em>On March 22nd you wrote to me asking for some notes on my work habits as a copywriter. They are appalling, as you are about to see:</em>

<em><strong>1.</strong> I have never written an advertisement in the office. Too many interruptions. I do all my writing at home.</em>
<em><strong>2.</strong> I spend a long time studying the precedents. I look at every advertisement which has appeared for competing products during the past 20 years.</em>
<em><strong>3.</strong> I am helpless without research material—and the more “motivational” the better.</em>
<em><strong>4.</strong> I write out a definition of the problem and a statement of the purpose which I wish the campaign to achieve. Then I go no further until the statement and its principles have been accepted by the client.</em>
<em><strong>5.</strong> Before actually writing the copy, I write down every concievable fact and selling idea. Then I get them organized and relate them to research and the copy platform.</em>
<em><strong>6.</strong> Then I write the headline. As a matter of fact I try to write 20 alternative headlines for every advertisement. And I never select the final headline without asking the opinion of other people in the agency. In some cases I seek the help of the research department and get them to do a split-run on a battery of headlines.</em>
<em><strong>7.</strong> At this point I can no longer postpone the actual copy. So I go home and sit down at my desk. I find myself entirely without ideas. I get bad-tempered. If my wife comes into the room I growl at her. (This has gotten worse since I gave up smoking.)</em>
<em><strong>8.</strong> I am terrified of producing a lousy advertisement. This causes me to throw away the first 20 attempts.</em>
<em><strong>9.</strong> If all else fails, I drink half a bottle of rum and play a Handel oratorio on the gramophone. This generally produces an uncontrollable gush of copy.</em>
<em><strong>10.</strong> The next morning I get up early and edit the gush.</em>
<em><strong>11.</strong> Then I take the train to New York and my secretary types a draft. (I cannot type, which is very inconvenient.)</em>
<em><strong>12.</strong> I am a lousy copywriter, but I am a good editor. So I go to work editing my own draft. After four or five editings, it looks good enough to show to the client. If the client changes the copy, I get angry—because I took a lot of trouble writing it, and what I wrote I wrote on purpose.</em>

<em>Altogether it is a slow and laborious business. I understand that some copywriters have much greater facility.</em>

<em>Yours sincerely,
D.O.</em>

Always keep a variety of fonts in your quick draw. From script to plain text, as well as some with a bit of artistic flare. Mixing your fonts can elevate the design of your promotional content, website etc.

Helpful tips when pairing different fonts:

<strong>1)</strong> Use fonts with similar feel but not too similar. Mixing fonts that only have slight variations can make for a messy appearance. Instead chose bold combinations to make for a dynamic design choice. We like to call this the Goldie Lock’s rule of choosing fonts that are “not too similar but not too different.”

<strong>TIP</strong>: Use at least 2 fonts to get some flare for your ad. We use this rule for all of our Florida marketing agency clients and it always gives us a great looking ad in the end.

Here are a few <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//work"">examples</a> of how we use fonts to spice up our ads.

[/quote]

<strong>2)</strong> Consider using the font in italics, bold or underlined for a different yet similar approach. It’s easy and can have a great impact on the overall look. Also think about all caps versus an all lowercase approach in your text to help emphasize certain aspects of your design.

<strong>3)</strong> Mix San-Serif and Serif fonts together. What is a serif you ask? It’s the little tale or line that extends from the edges of the letters. San-Serif fonts don’t have this accent detail where as Serif fonts do.

<strong>4)</strong> Unify fonts by simply using the same color palette.  Try using different shades of the same color or different colors with similar intensities or saturation level.

<strong>5)</strong> Think about the font weight and priority that it carries in design. Some fonts are naturally going to draw the eye first, so think about using these fonts for headers or titles etc. To get the right balance, test your font features. Does it have a bold, italic, or strong option?
<h3>20 of our favorite free fonts</h3>
&nbsp;
<h3>Handwritten &amp; Script</h3>
These handwritten and script fonts really ad a trendy, design forward feel to your ads. Use them for main headers for an attention grabber or use them to emphasize a side note, tip, or product detail. It’s a great way to make callout text have a stand alone feel.

College grads entering music marketing: Looking past record labels,"The record industry’s dead. That’s what the news reports and the numbers support.  In the traditional sense it’s true. Music labels like Sony and Warner Music Group are like dial-up modems or skorts. Their model is broken, outdated and most likely never returning to its glory days. Thankfully though, the music itself isn’t going anywhere. If anything, it’s becoming more expansive and infiltrating more ear canals through the use of the latest and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">greatest marketing strategies</a> employed by individuals and small firms who understand that success in the industry anymore is measured in Twitter followers and YouTube views.

Artists no longer need to rely on major labels to push their work for them. It’s a beautiful thing, really. And it means a whole lot to youngsters trying to break into the competitive, relatively small field of music marketing. In the past, labels threw hundreds of thousands of dollars toward the anticipation of album launches months ahead of their release.  Now, marketing lead-time is much more immediate.

Take for example, Kanye West and his GOOD Fridays. GOOD Fridays were the rapper / producer’s ingenious marketing ploy in support of his LP album <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. </em> West released free singles on a weekly basis, generating 15 tracks in all.  What makes this tactic so effective is West’s understanding of the fact that consumers no longer want to wait for the rigmarole of an album launch to subside. In fact, the album as a primary moneymaking unit for an artist is no more. It’s a relic left over by labels that require artists to meet Minimum Delivery and Release Commitments if they want to see their bonuses.

[quote]Kanye may be a polarizing public figure; say what you will about him, but even Taylor Swift can’t argue that when it comes to self-promotion, the man is unmatched in his efforts. [/quote]

Upstart company <a href=""http://www.fanbridge.com/company.php?ref=public_site_footer"">Fanbridge</a> is at the forefront of the shifting world of music marketing.  Based out of New York City, Fanbridge Co-Founder and President Noah Dinkin used to manage bands before launching the “leading fan management and marketing platform for email and social media.” Dinkin now helps artists, musicians, actors and athletes to grow their individual brand by growing their fan base. The site allows users to track and update Facebook, Myspace and Twitter pages all from a single location.

Other sites like <a href=""http://www.cdbaby.com/about"">CD Baby</a> allow independent artists to distribute their albums online without having to go through major distribution channels. At the end of the day, our <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//orlando-video-production/"">Orlando video production</a> company realizes that music has fallen back into the hands of its creators. Those creators need to be informed of the various simple yet effective outlets available to them online. That’s where the music marketer takes the reins.

Marketers today must think on their feet. They need to help license material out to various <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIPPzvv9VTs"">commercials</a> and television spots. Consider how helpful the MacBook Air ad was to Yael Naim’s “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E98Eyl5Et0w"">New Soul</a>.” They need to ensure that an artist is continuously present in the eyes of his/ her fans. That can mean posting behind-the-scenes videos on YouTube or Tweeting links to new songs that can be previewed on Last.fm or SoundCloud. Mostly, it’s important to remember that a stodgy old print ad in <em>Billboard Magazine</em> only goes so far anymore. Live streaming, mobile applications, Tumblr, Do-It-Yourself (DIY); these are but a few of the buzzwords future music marketers would do well to familiarize themselves with.

Keeping tabs on the competition's ad sensibilities & success rates,"The online advertising front has changed drastically in the past 5 years with new and developing platforms such as coupon deal sites, new blogs being born every day, e-commerce websites, Yelp, Google Adwords, etc. offering several advertising avenues. In this sea of the world wide web, it seems overwhelming to keep tabs on your competitors’ strategies and gauge their success rates.  Who are they advertising with? Did their latest advertising campaign perform that well? How big is their advertising budget?

Frankly, it would take the work of Sherlock Holmes to research and find every platform your competitors are using to reach out to customers. Well not to worry my dear Watson, there are some easy ways to track your competitors ad sensibilities and success rates without employing much more than your finger tips and a keyboard. Why, it’s almost elementary!

Below are three simple steps you can take to monitor your competition and learn from their mistakes and successes:

<strong>ONE:</strong> Sign up for a free beginner account with <a href=""http://mixrank.com/"">MixRank</a>, a leading spy tool for text and display ads. Just enter your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">competitor’s website</a>, a key advertising word/phrase associated with their company or product, or a major advertisers and publishers to begin. In seconds, you’ll have a list of your competitor’s top active ad links, a record of their ad reach, rates from the best performing ads, a link list of their ad publishers, and a listing of both text and display ads.

<em>[quote]Tip: Take a look at both their text ads and display ad details. Knowing which type of ad and which ad design has been more successful can help you create more engaging advertising content and be one step ahead of your competition.[/quote]</em>

<strong>TWO</strong>: Check out your competitor’s keywords and how often those specific words or phrases are being sought out by customers using <a href=""https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS"">GoogleAds Keyword Tool</a>. For instance, we use a similar service when looking at our competition via a keyword search like: “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando marketing and ad agency</a>.” You can see which keywords rank on the hierarchy and drive traffic results as well as the words may be viewed as negative or non applicable. We always discover more about what the customer is searching for and if our competition is incorporating these keywords in their advertising campaigns.

<em>[quote]Tip:</em> <em>Use this competitor information to find out what keywords you should be incorporating in your ad and website content to help boost your chances of customers finding you first. [/quote]</em>

<strong>THREE</strong>: Become the 007 of advertising and join <a href=""https://www.spyfu.com/"">SpyFu</a>. This web service offers a host of benefits and “spyware” to compare domains, discover new keywords, find the best ad copy and check the quality and success of your own advertising campaigns. You’ll have access to top ads, domain-level numbers, and gain some insight on their SEO traffic and Adwords budget just by typing in your competitor’s company name or keywords.

<em>Tip: Stay ahead of the game and check out which publishers are boosting the success rates of their ads. These statistics can help guide you when choosing the right publishers to advertise with and give you a higher return on your advertising investment.</em>

Content is King at Our Florida Advertising Agency,"Earlier this year, I wrote a post about the <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//blog/how-content-marketing-will-revolutionize-brands-in-2013/"">impact of content marketing</a> in 2013.  Since that time, more than a few people have wanted to know more about what I meant… what is content marketing?  How can I use it to help grow my business?  Is it expensive?  So, I thought it would be a good idea to address these questions in a follow-up post discussing what <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> means to me.

Every day, thousands of blog posts are written, thousands of hours of content is being uploaded to YouTube, and millions of people are posting and sharing on social networks.  Yes, it can be hard to sift through everything.  The idea behind content marketing is that your customers won’t NEED to.

If your customers trust you to provide leading, cutting-edge reports on trends, ideas and innovations within your industry, then why would they need to look elsewhere for the same content?  If you can make this information accessible, fun and engaging, then this virtually eliminates the need to look to sources such as trade magazines, big media companies and RSS feeds to find the information that’s relevant to their area of interest.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Content marketing</a> is why <a href=""http://www.pepsi.com/"">Pepsi</a> can offer an interactive home page that streams Tweets, video and content from a number of sources.  There is seemingly no connection between Pepsi and the music industry, but Pepsi has honed in on the types of people it hopes to attract, and can thereby zero in on their interests.  In a sense, it’s no longer about the drink (that’s always the bottom line), but it’s about the entertainment value and perceived relationship between the music fans and their soft drink choices.  People can go to Pepsi Pulse to learn more about their favorite artists, watch video coverage of new and interesting things in entertainment, and potentially even see their own Tweets broadcast on the Pepsi home page.

Companies that embrace that their brands aren’t just about the products that they sell will have much more success further down the line.  The association may only be psychological, but with all other things equal, pop culture music fans regularly exposed to the Pepsi brand are more likely to choose Pepsi amongst competitors.

Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content strategy</a> doesn’t need to be limited to the product you sell.  Writing, blogging and reporting about things that may be of interest to your followers is a great way to build relationships – you may run a small furniture store, but your funny cat meme you post early on a Monday morning will help bring smiles to the faces of your fans.

One important thing to remember is that the content you’re pushing out should be high quality.  If you own a small fashion retailer, writing uninformed, keyword-oriented posts about subjects you know little about will come across as fluff, and may even dilute your brand.

Not Just For Cats & Kids: Up Your Marketing Campaigns With Videos,"Cats and kids have long ruled the online viral video scene, with images of dancing babies and cats doing, well, pretty much anything, flooding our inboxes daily. Just how much do people love videos? A recent ComScore <a href=""http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/5/comScore_Releases_April_2012_U.S._Online_Video_Rankings"">study </a>revealed that 181 million U.S. Internet users watched nearly 37 billion online content videos in April of 2012. That’s a lot of cats playing the piano—and marketers can’t ignore those types of numbers.
<h3>People Are Visual</h3>
Of course there’s more to online videos than felines, and as a marketer, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">using video in a campaign</a> feeds our instant gratification, I’m-too-lazy-and-or-busy-to-read lifestyles. Most people are visual and would rather watch and listen to a brand’s story by clicking play than by plodding through paragraph after paragraph of black-and-white text. So, consumers not only will watch your video, but they are probably seeking it out. Everyone loves a good how-to video, and these can serve as extensions of product videos and commercials. Short videos are easy for an audience to digest, and they ramp up click-throughs and open rates for email marketing campaigns.
<h3>Videos Bring Brands To Life</h3>
In a world where consumers can shop in their underwear from the comfort of their home, videos can do more to not only tell the story of a brand, but to promote a sense of closeness to that brand, bringing its products and the people behind them to life, and recreating the experience of shopping at the store. Who doesn’t want to know what it’s like to work at their favorite brands? Videos can provide that behind-the-scenes element that draws consumers in and makes them feel like the brand is a part of them and they’re a part of the brand. Consumers can see products at work or clothes in motion, making them more likely to purchase. Choose <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> to assist in your <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//agency"">Orlando video production</a>, helping you create videos to integrate into your marketing campaigns to see results.

<h3>Search Engines Love Videos</h3>
When an Internet user types a query into a Google or other search engine’s bar, a <a href=""http://www.reelseo.com/videos-ranking-universal-search-results-video-seo-study/"">study</a> shows they are 41 percent more likely to click on a video result than a plain text article of blog post. Statistics like this one make videos a must in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">marketing campaigns</a>. In ranking video content, Google puts the same emphasis and uses the same algorithm as text content.
<h3>Videos Are Fun</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our agency</a> can take your product and your brand to a new level with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">Orlando video production</a>, helping you create videos that will enhance your marketing campaigns. Adding professional-grade videos to your arsenal will boost credibility and trust from existing and potential customers. Unlike most of the tasks you probably perform throughout the course of a work day, making marketing videos is a chance to let loose, have fun and be creative.

How have you used videos in your marketing campaigns? What type of results have you seen?

Get More Shares on Your Video Content With This Guide,"As marketers, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> is well aware that younger generations aren’t consuming media in the way that we did growing up.  Many young adults don’t even own televisions – they can get their media from a variety of sources such as <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/"">Hulu</a>, <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/"">Netflix</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/"">YouTube</a> .

This also has added side effects.  While Hulu runs commercials, Netflix and (most of the time) YouTube do not.  That means this younger generation has the capability to opt out of watching advertising through commercials.

When targeting young people, marketers have even more of a challenge in trying to engage young people.  In the television days, no one ever questioned whether a household was actively engaged while watching a commercial – but, since digital content is so easy to track, engagement becomes key.

Below are a few tips to help get more shares with your own digital video content.

<b>1. Seed Your Video:</b>  Did you read our video about the importance of <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//blog/theyre-not-just-for-cats-and-kids-punch-up-your-marketing-campaigns-with-videos/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">seeding branded content</a>?  If not, then we certainly recommend that as a starting point.  The article discusses the importance of investing some of your budget into making sure your video gets optimal placement on the types of websites that attract your audience.

<b>2. Tell a Story:</b>  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">Storytelling</a> is a far more effective tool than the corporate speak we’re all used to.  Leave the formal, data driven content to a boardroom; in order to connect with today’s busy, tech-savvy consumer, it’s important to relate through storytelling techniques.  Most stories take the listener on a journey, so think about your journey as you create a script for your digital video content.

<b>3. Promote!</b>  I’m often surprised by people who think that simply uploading a video to YouTube is enough to get people interested in their content.  But, if you want to get more shares and likes for your video, you must also think like a PR professional.  This may involve reaching out to trusted contacts, influential bloggers, and friends with popular Twitter accounts to help spread your content.

<b>4. Listen to the Conversation:</b>  Where are people talking about things that are relevant to your brand, and to your video content in general?  Make sure you have an active presence at these hubs.  Tweeting at people who mention your brand or share an interest in your brand’s field will help facilitate engagement in the long run, but can also be a short-term way to help promote your content.

<b>5. Post at Peak Times:</b>  Brands and businesses can use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media monitoring analytic</a> tools to help determine when their audiences are most active, most engaged and most interested.  Use this knowledge to help push your video during peak times.  Also, remember to push it quickly and repeatedly across social networks…. in almost every case, the most important timeframe of a video’s life cycle is the first 48 hours.  In this age, we operate in real-time, so anything that’s shared later will have less impact, and will ultimately be less relevant.

The Pope’s Election as a sucessful Marketing Campaign,"The way everyone is talking about it, it could have been an announcement from <a href=""http://nasa.gov"">NASA</a> about life on another planet, or a miracle performed on earth in front of thousands of witnesses.  It’s all over newspaper outlets, television, social media sites, mobile phones and popular blogs (including this blog from your favorite Orlando ad agency!).  More than the Superbowl, the Grammys and the Oscars combined, Twitter feeds are lighting up with revelry about the big news.

Yesterday, the Vatican announced a new pope.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis"">Jorge Mario Bergoglio</a> from Argentina will succeed Pope Benedict XVI as the leader of the Catholic Church.  Adding another layer of excitement to the announcement, Bergoglio is the first non-European leader in more than 1,000 years.

While it’s always big news when the Vatican announces a new Pope, the reveal has special significance in the digital era.  Because of the lightning-fast speed at which information travels, anyone can witness the digital behaviors that drive the spread of the big news throughout the Internet.  To be able to latch on to these digital behaviors is a marketer’s dream.  If any product or service launch gained the same traction as the announcement of the new Pope, then the marketers behind the announcement would certainly secure their places as leaders within the industry.

The ways that people share things have shifted dramatically in the past eight years, which was when the Vatican announced Pope Benedict XVI.  With the advent of social sharing, so too have come ways to reach millions of people instantaneously.

It starts with buzz.  People are excited about something new, and they want to share their excitement with others.  They may not even know what, exactly, it is that they’re excited about – that’s certainly often the case with the launch of items such as the iPhone and the upcoming Google Glass.  The buzz is that whatever it is, it will be revolutionary.  A new pope has the potential to shift the direction of the Catholic Churh, an organization that has members in countries around the world.

The buzz leads to anticipation.  More people are talking, and more media are covering the big announcement.  People around the world are sharing messages, reeling in anticipation, and covering every breaking bit of information from every angle (white smoke versus black smoke).  Just before the Vatican introduced the new pope, masses of people were in St. Peter’s square, eagerly awaiting the announcement.  From afar, people around the world tuned in via their televisions, mobile devices and laptops.  Who will it be?  When will they announce it?  Why does it matter?

Then, once the team is ready to share the big news, it’s time for the big reveal.  The audience’s attention is focused, as they are eager and ready to share their thoughts.  The big reveal is an almost majestic experience – highly ritualized, and offering a spectacle for everyone waiting to witness history and hear the news.  For the announcement of the new pope, the ceremony is as old as the Catholic Church.  For Apple, it’s a press conference attended by only the most highly-regarded technophiles.

And finally, once the big reveal is completed, it’s the time for media reporting and social sharing.  The people who’ve bore witness to the main event are tweeting, Facebooking, posting on LinkedIn, blogging and engaging in all types of digital sharing.  The momentum lasts as long as people keep talking about it.  It’s big news, and in the age of digital sharing, anyone can contribute to the conversation about the new Pope.

The cycle operates in a bell curve, with the highest point being the big reveal.  Eventually, the excitement tapers off, and it’s up to the marketers to keep their product fresh and innovative.  For marketers, the entire scene is familiar.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> wishes the new pope the best of luck in his endeavors in helping to guide the Catholic Church to greatness.

What do you think about the coverage of the new Pope?  Would love to hear your comments below.

Video Production 101: What You Need To Know Before Doing Video,"For a company taking its first shot at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">creating video content</a>, it can be overwhelming to walk into a meeting room for the first time to create a digital video strategy.  Often, new content creators are unfamiliar with the actual costs and types of teams needed to help successfully create and distribute digital video content.

It’s important to remember that your team is not alone in wanting to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">create content</a>; you are competing with thousands of other brands and individuals who are each vying for a piece of your audience’s time.  This audience attention is a limited resource… until there are magically more hours in the day, the amount of time people have to consume content is not going to change anytime soon.

Below are a few tips from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando video production agency</a> to help ease you through the process of creating your first branded video for optimum resource allocation and sharability.

<b>Have a Good Idea:</b>  This seems like a no-brainer, but you might be surprised at the number of people who want to create content just for the sake of creating content.  It is essential to remember that bad content reflects poorly on your brand, and is unlikely to be shared organically.  Brainstorm an idea that’s on-brand, and targets your audience.  (If you don’t have a good idea, fear not!  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida marketing agency</a> is brimming with agency experts who have the knowledge and understanding to help you create a digital video concept that captures your brand.

<b>Assign a Project Manager/ Producer:</b>  This is a crucial step in creating a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">successful video</a>.  The project manager should be the person in control of the actual production process.  This person should have the responsibility of overseeing the budget, and may assign people to schedule shoots and secure essential film equipment.  This person may also step in as a producer, who can give feedback to the production team.  The project manager will ultimately also be responsible for formulating a distribution strategy.

[/quote]

<b>Create a Budget:</b>  In my experience, a company can create a piece of digital content at almost any budget.  I’ve seen successful videos shot at production values of less than $200, and I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of dollars thrown away on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaigns</a> that didn’t quite hit the mark.  More money can buy you better tools, but they can’t make a bad idea good.  In fact, some studies suggest that production values have absolutely no bearing on a viewer’s perception of a digital video.  I recommend that a brand settle on a budget after coming up with the idea, as it will help to determine what’s realistically feasible.  If your concept involves flying in an elephant from Nigeria, but you’re working with a small budget, it’s worth it to see if the same effect can be achieved using a green screen or editing device.

<b>Formulate a Distribution Strategy:</b>  Will your strategy involve sponsored placements on sites like <a href=""http://twitter.com"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a>?  Or are you depending on shares alone, targeting influencers and popular bloggers within your network?  No matter what your strategy, the most important part is to have a strategy in place for when you’re ready to put your video out into the world.

No Doubt About Klout: It Matters – But Is That Good or Bad?,"<a href=""https://fitsmallbusiness.com/reviews/social-media-management-software-reviews/#graveyard"">Klout</a> is a funny concept.  Basically, it’s an internet popularity contest.  It uses an algorithm, pulling from sources such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn to put a number to your “Standard of Influence.”  Engage with the right people, and a lot of them, and sit back as your Klout score rises.

People put a lot of emphasis on Klout scores.  In fact, <a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395711,00.asp"">an article in PC Magazine</a> actually encourages social media users to increase their Klout scores by urging them to “Sit at the Popular Kids Table.”  (I hate to think that my Klout score goes down because I like to engage with my hilarious-yet-introverted niece, one who doesn’t have a high Klout score because she’s too focused on her career to spend much time on Twitter.)

I am of the opinion that your Klout score IS important, but only within fields that demand high Klout scores, and within which it is necessary for a person to have established a certain level of digital presence or online reputation.  Basically, if you’re vying for a position that requires you to sit with the cool kids, then you should probably at least be sitting near their table.

Does this include entry-level <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketers</a> or students seeking internships?  At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a>, we personally don’t care about our interns' Klout scores.  I care more whether that person is competent, hard working, creative and has the skills to complete the work required.  We don’t care as much about Klout because, if that entry-level applicant or intern DOES have a high Klout score, we might actually assume that she was too busy tweeting in class or at work to actually pay attention, as it takes a lot of work and dedication to actively maintain Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and a variety of other platforms (which is why it’s a full-time job!).

However, if we're planning to hire to digital marketing expert to speak at a conference for thousands of dollars, we would certainly want to know that the person has a high level of influence across a number of platforms.  But, this is strangely in stark contrast with Klout’s business model.  Klout offers Klout Perks to people who have high Klout scores, but the last thing I would want is for someone I deem reputable to be plugging products on their social media sites (unless that person is a brand marketer and is actively promoting his or her own brands).

But, the reality is that Klout does matter.  It matters to some employers, who think that Klout’s algorithm shows that a highly-scored person knows how to engage in social media behaviors that drive results.  It matters because influencer marketing is big money – if you can get your products into the hands of influencers, you can get them to write about your products.  If they become loyal fans, then it’s essentially easy publicity for you, the only value exchange being the price of the discount or free goods you’ve given them to cover or review.

Whether Klout signifies the dawning of an era, or the demise of the next generation, it’s essential that every brand marketer knows what it is and how to use it advantageously.  Still, in my mind, and at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a>, Klout is no real comparison to real-life experience.",,3/20/2013 10:13,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/No-Doubt-About-Klout-It-Matters-But-Is-That-Good-or-Bad-.jpg,no-doubt-about-klout-it-matters-but-is-that-good-or-bad,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How to Market to Moms: Night Time is the Right Time,"When the producers at Viacom did some market data on their viewers, they discovered an interesting insight.  Moms would often put their children in front of the television to watch shows on Nickelodeon while they cooked, cleaned and did chores around the house, anytime between the hours of 5 p.m. and 10 p.m.  These mothers would then turn the TV off to put the kids to bed, returning sometime after 10 p.m. to sit in front of the television to relax for a moment, and to unwind from the day.

And the first channel these moms saw when they turned on their TVs?  It was Nickelodeon.

Viacom’s leading executives got creative with this insight and recently launched an effort to connect to these moms through a 2-hour television slot that runs programming geared toward moms from 10 p.m. until midnight (7 p.m. until 9 p.m. PST).  The idea was to capitalize on this routine action by introducing a brand targeted toward these moms during that time slot.  The answer?  <a href=""http://www.nickmom.com/"">NickMom</a>.

But more than just a block of programming, NickMom is also a community. Women who watch the programming in the evening can also incorporate elements of social television, Tweeting and Facebooking about their favorite shows and bringing the channel into their homes on multiple screens.

One tiny insight led to an entire <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy</a> overhaul at Viacom.  The insight is a powerful one, too.  Because of school schedules, soccer practices and piano lessons, plus work, many moms do not get to relax until the end of the day.

Marketers can use insights such as this to help their own companies to reach out to moms as well.  In many families, mom might sip a glass of wine to unwind as her family lay resting, sitting on the couch with her tablet in hand as she checks her email, messages friends on Facebook and browses on the online shops from her favorite retailers.  In fact, in 2011, the New York Times published <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/business/online-retailers-home-in-on-a-new-demographic-the-drunken-consumer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">an entire article</a> on the phenomenon of inebriated shopping.  The article notes how companies like Gilt, Sacks, and QVC are capitalizing on the trend, noting spikes in sales around the evening hours, and also noting that the offers sent around these times generate results.  Though the Times article doesn’t specifically limit the tipsy shopping trend to moms, it’s worth noting that the article mentions various types of companies that cater to the female, 18-35 age group.

Even for moms who do not drink alcohol, the evening is time to relax.  Once dinner is served, dishes are washed and kids are asleep, people are happy, relaxed and ready to spend some time on themselves.  And, in this era of mobile devices, sitting down watching television doesn’t mean you have to quit browsing the Internet – you can browse from your phone, pausing your program at any time to make sure you don’t miss anything.

If you are trying to hone in on moms to help grow your business, perhaps it is worth experimenting with running an evening promotion, sending nighttime email blasts or posting on Facebook later in the evening, after work hours.  If you can reach the mom when she is feeling social and relaxed, you are not only are more likely to inspire a spontaneous purchase, but also to form a positive association between the mom and your brand.

Moms are a very particular target, and in many homes they hold the purchasing power to make decisions as to spending, budgeting and savings.  To learn more about how you can market to moms in order to create brand preference and instill brand loyalty, check out our Florida marketing agency’s recent whitepaper on <a title=""Marketing to Moms"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//paper/marketing-to-moms/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">marketing to moms</a>, which discusses strategies for segmentation, creating appeals and assessing your own brand to determine the right moms for your business.",,3/26/2013 15:43,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Marketing-to-Moms-Night-Time-is-the-Right-Time.jpg,marketing-to-moms-night-time-is-the-right-time,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"The Power of Going Mobile, And Why Your Business Needs To","Consumers’ expectations for instant information gratification is at an all time high according to comedian <a href=""http://www.comedycentral.com/video-clips/avmzsg/stand-up-louis-ck--give-it-a-second"">Louis CK</a> and other statistical findings.  As trivial as the information may be, a picture of Axel Rose or a YouTube clip of a cat jumping into a box, mobile users expect to have information readily available at their finger tips.  In fact, 61% of mobile users claim that they quickly move on to another site if they don’t find what they are looking for right away.

So how does this instant mobile gratification relate to your business? Well let’s look at the facts:
<ul class=""list-disc"">
 	<li>68% of smartphone owners use their phones to go online on a daily basis. 28% use their mobile devices as their primary way of accessing the internet. (<a href=""http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Smartphones/Section-2/Smartphones-as-an-internet-appliance.aspx"">Pew Internet</a>)</li>
 	<li>50% of a surveyed audience claimed that even if they liked a business that the lack of a mobile-friendly site would detour them doing business with that company again. (<a href=""http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2012/09/mobile-friendly-sites-turn-visitors.html"">Google Survey 2012</a>)</li>

If you’re all about customer service and how your company can relate to them, then you’ll take these numbers to heart. It’s simply putting the customer first in regards to your website. Even in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> we found that most customers are simply asking to for easy access.

Like the idea of building a separate site, but don’t have the budget to create one at the moment? Here are some simple ways to enhance your existing website to make it more mobile-friendly without creating a separate mobile site:
<ol class=""list-dec"">
 	<li>Keep it short and sweet. Mobile users are on the go and are just looking for key information like your hours of operation, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">contact info or social media links</a>, not downloadable PDFs of your recent product catalogue. So simplify your content and think about the mobile user and prioritize and streamline your content to help the person on the go move quickly to a point of sale or locate your store.</li>
 	<li>No pop-up windows or drop down menus please! Make your site finger friendly and decrease loading time  by simplifying your navigation tabs and browsing windows.</li>
 	<li>Stay away from Java and Flash as many phones don’t support these operating systems and increases loading time. Don’t let your content go unseen or seem inaccessible to certain users.</li>
 	<li>Allow users to switch between the full site version and the mobile. They may prefer to see more information beyond the paired down mobile version.</li>

How to Reach the parents-to-be through effective marketing,"Maternity marketing typically reaches out to the current mom, without putting much emphasis on the woman who’s expecting.  But particularly for first-time moms, these women and their supportive family members must also make decisions about what’s best for their as-of-yet unborn children… what color to paint the nursery, which toys to purchase for the tot, what types of formula to buy and what kinds of clothes the child should wear.

Companies that target the current mom without thinking of the present mom may be too late – once she has the child, she may have already made up her mind about the best formulas, baby wipes and other newborn needs to suit her child.  And once you lose the expectant mother, you may lose her for life – if she becomes loyal to one brand, it will be hard to get her to switch over.

Marketers can target expectant moms by reaching out to them through the avenues they’ll be using most.  Perhaps one of the easiest ways is through <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO content</a> and Google AdWords.  First-time mothers may be anxious about what constitutes a “normal” pregnancy, potential parenting woes and the “right” parenting methods.  They’ll often look to Google and other search engine tools for help.  A Google search for “How to Change a Diaper” produces more than 29 million results.  While it may be difficult to provide <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO content</a> to beat the top-ranked page, a Google AdWords placement for your brand could do wonders for your diaper company.

Instructional content may also be a promising avenue for reaching your target mom-to-be.  If you haven’t read our recent blog on content marketing, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/roadmap-content-marketing"">click here</a> to check it out.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Content marketing</a> is a way to reach out to your target demographics, and therefore a blog directed to the mom-to-be and the newborn mom practically has a built-in audience.  Younger, hipper, smartphone-wielding moms may be drawn to video content, which is easily accessible from multiple devices.

Okay, but what about the dad-to-be? According to a study conducted last year, 52% of millennial parents told us that ads they see are made for mothers more than fathers, and 83% say they think advertising for parents should appeal to both mothers and fathers equally. In fact, there was a successful online movement in the U.S. that put pressure on the site “Amazon Mom” to rename its service to “Amazon Family.”

Some marketing tips we think would be helpful in reaching dads would be to make it easier for dads to find the right information on their mobile devices at any time, to include dads in the story since household duties are shared amongst both parents, and to understand what motivates and works with dads may be motivated differently than their female counterparts. We’ve already begun to see a shift toward <a href=""http://fortune.com/2016/06/19/dadvertising-commercials-fathers-day-ads/"">“dadvertising”</a> - and we’re diggin’ it.

So if you’re aiming to reach soon-to-be parents, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a> encourages you to think about both parts of the story.  Catching a mom-to-be in the pregnancy phase may mean that you’re attracting a loyal and valuable customer for life, and speaking to a “dad-in-training” may stand out more amongst a sea of mom-oriented messaging.

Grassroots Marketing Ideas for Small Business Owners,"Almost every day, I see a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a> and think of how, if I’d had that marketing budget, I could make it bigger, better and more engaging.  But unfortunately, the reality is that small businesses often have tight marketing budgets, and are unable to undertake the elaborate marketing efforts that someone with a multi-million dollar budget can.

Recently, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> has been consulting smaller businesses about ideas that they can put into play with small marketing budgets, in order to see big returns.  While every business has its unique strengths and weakness, there are a few universal tools that marketers can put into play at a grassroots budget in order to help market their businesses.

<b>Celebrity Endorsements</b>: Okay, so we realize that not every person is friends with a celebrity, or even if you are, it might not be the type of celebrity who is willing to endorse your brand for free.  But recently, a friend of mine gained headway on her brand’s social media page when she posted images of her fashions appearing on a popular network prime-time sitcom.  It was a huge draw for her brand’s target demographic.  Though it wasn’t technically a celebrity endorsement, it showed celebrity affiliation, which was great self-made PR for the people who purchase from her store.

<b>Go to Your Target</b>:  If you specialize in vintage silver, and your products are available online, why only reach out to your current “followers” when you could be gaining new ones? Though it’s sometimes hard to believe, the types of message boards that were popular years ago are still popular with thousands of people, people who identify with a given community.  Additionally, sites like Reddit and Craigslist feature bulletin board systems, allowing people to involve themselves in conversations based on niche topics.  You can also use social media monitoring to reach out to people who love your products or services to engage with them and reward them for posting.

<b>Establish Yourself as an Expert:</b> If your business is the leading website that offers realtime information about finance and interest rates, you can establish yourself as an expert in these fields by writing about these topics.  You can start your own blog, post informative slide decks on <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/"">SlideShare</a>, or can actively post in forms such as <a href=""http://www.quora.com"">Quora</a> to show off your expertise.  Expertise in a specific field is great publicity and marketing.  It helps lend credibility, not to mention helps your search engine ranking for people who organically search for keywords related to your terms.

<b>Connect with Potential Customers Online and Offline</b>:  If your digital followers are also real-life customers, it’s important to make them feel as though they are part of your community both onscreen and off-screen.  A friend of mine incentivizes people to come into her store by offering exclusive discounts for birthdays and other life events, which she keeps track of through constant communication and a host of social media tools.  Though it can be difficult for her do this with every one of her hundreds of followers, the ones who do receive treats or discounts from her almost always react positively or share their finds.

Here are a few things to help guide you in your advertising endeavors. Practice makes perfect as they always say.  Even with a list of best practices and sample copy, it may take a few tries to get your ads targeted just right for your audience and most appeal. Here are a few tips to get you on the right track:
<h3>Images</h3>
The image size is small (110 pixels wide by 80 pixels tall) and not the best quality so make the most of your image by choosing something with bold/bright colors, that clearly <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">represent your product or promotional content</a>.

-Try a couple different images to gauge audience response and hone your imagery skills.
<h3>Copy</h3>
1)   Make your 135 characters count!

2)   Make your call to action clear in the body of the ad or in the title. The audience wants to know what will happen when they click on the link. Use key action words that push an audience to action and explain a bit about where this link will take them. For instance:
<ol>
 	<li> “See more fashion DIY tips”</li>
 	<li>“Order online”</li>
 	<li>“Enter the cooking contest”</li>
</ol>
3)   Include key information in the title of the ad like your business name, location, or business focus to help make your intent clear and represent yourself better

4)   What is your goal with this ad, what do you want to promote? Website, blog post, event, contest, drive customer engagement – make sure that you keep your goals in mind when creating your ad
<h3>Audience</h3>
Who to reach out to? Choosing the relevant audience

Choose the basic demographics like age, gender, country, interests, and connection to help steer your ads to the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">right audience</a>.

Considering your connections is one of the main ways to increase your click-through rate. It is proven that ads that target existing fans have 7X higher click through rate plus a higher conversion rate than those that simple promote to potential followers or fans

For example if Susie likes a link or status update on your fan page, a story is created. These stories can be promoted within Susie’s profile page and could bring her friends attention to your business or fan page – Good for business pages that have at least 100 likes</li>

How to Reach the Female Sports Fan In Your Market,"In popular culture, it’s common to see television shows where a man sits around watching football, while his wife stands around complaining.  These images that are ingrained in our cultural behavior show men drinking beer and watching the big game, with the women in the corner, cleaning up the mess.

Because of the often masculine appeal of most sports, it’s common to confuse their primary audiences with people of the same gender.  But the reality is that this is not so.

In fact, more than one half of tennis fans are female, a fact that tennis marketers appear to recognize.  Many female tennis spectators are also players (certainly plenty of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> team members love to get outside for a good match!), and as such, companies continue to invest money in creating fashionable products and apparel for the female tennis enthusiast.

Others are not quite as obvious.

For example, NFL games are dominated by male-leaning television commercials and sports coverage.  However, more than a third of the people who identify themselves as football fans are female.  As such, there seems to be a disconnect between the methods of sports advertising and this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">demographic</a>.

[quote]It’s important to remember that, from an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/economic-impact-study-services/"">ROI perspective</a>, women account for 85% of all purchases in all categories, including automotive purchases, apparel, household goods, and food purchases.[/quote]  Being able to hone in on the potential female customer can greatly increase the opportunity for successful commercial advertising during primetime sports slots, increased awareness through sponsorship activities and for cultivating ongoing relationships with the female sports enthusiast.

A common misconception is that women who are sports fans are also somehow tomboys, and that, if given the choice, they would choose hoodies bearing their teams’ logos instead of cute sundresses that show the same logo.  There aren’t many companies that have successfully tested this theory, but a sports apparel company catering to creating high fashion lines for females might actually do quite well!  But, leaning too much in this direction can also be polarizing;... working off the assumption that every ladies’ night at the ball game should be about pink bows and jewelry raffles can be just as belittling.

As with most categorizations, classifying a group as “women” is just one categorization of a number of broader subsets of personalities and interests.  It’s important for sports franchise marketers and sports brands to think creatively when trying to reach the female <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">target consumer</a>.

Perhaps the number one marketing sin is forgetting that she exists.  Alienating the female sports fan by creating ads that are masculine-learning or blatantly sexist effectively costs sports marketers revenue and goodwill in the eyes of the female consumer.

Instead, sports marketers should take heed of some useful advice to help market to the female sports fan.

<b>Develop Audience Insights:</b> Using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media listening tools</a>, sports marketers can garner significant data about their female consumers.  Are they using Pinterest, or are they more Twitter-friendly?  These insights can help sports marketers craft campaigns that offer <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">maximum exposure</a>.

<b>Develop Products Designed for the Female Sports Fan:</b> Thinking outside the box to create products such as colorful iPhone sleeves bearing a team’s logo can help the female sports fan to express herself, while also giving her something that offers practicality and functionality.

<b>Encourage Engagement:</b> An article published on The Next Web last year noted that women are<a href=""http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/02/21/women-are-more-likely-to-make-your-social-media-campaign-go-viral/""> “more likely” to make your social media campaign go viral</a>.  Make the most of your female fans by encouraging them to share.

Create a Winning Content Marketing Game Plan With This Guide,"It’s baseball season, and your whole family is excited to eat some peanuts and Crackerjacks while watching your home team hit home runs into the grandstand on a warm spring day.

Except, there’s a problem.  Your team is on a horrible losing streak, with no end in sight.  After a few games of watching loss after loss, the outing to the ball game seems like less of a big event, and like more of a chore.  Your children would rather stay in and play video games, and America’s pastime is starting to feel like your own waste of time.

Unfortunately, these are true realities for sports teams, burdened with the task of continuing to make money even when their teams are not winning games.  So how does the sports marker get you, the unhappy baseball fan, to continue coming to games, whereby you’ll presumably order overpriced nachos and Budweiser on draft, thereby continuing to spend even more of your hard-earned money on a losing team?

For sports marketers who are struggling with attendance, the experts at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a> have come up with a few ideas to help your business thrive… even when your team isn’t.

<b>Partner with Charities:</b>  If you’re having trouble selling tickets, try partnering with charitable organizations to help get people in the seats.  The benefits are two-fold: first, partnering with charities is a great way to show your team’s commitment to your fans, and to your community.  Secondly, the tickets winners, who might not have attended the games otherwise, will be likely to share their fun experiences with their friends on social media.

<b>Evaluate Your Brand’s Message:</b> Is it about winning?  Or, is it more about having a good time, and getting a chance to bond with family?  Focusing on the feel good aspects of seeing a live sporting event is a great way to entice people to go out for some sunshine at the big game.

<b>Run a Big Campaign:</b>  Offering chances for spectators to win prizes is a great way to allow them to engage with your team’s brand.  The fun experience of having the chance to meet the players offers a lifetime of great memories, and people will line up to buy tickets for the chance to win a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (or, even just a free calendar or other promotional freebie).

<b>Partner with Deals Sites:</b> If you’re having trouble filling seats at full cost, then consider selling them at discount prices.  Consider big daily deals sites like Groupon, but also consider local outlets that also offer deals, such as locally-focused blogs and newspapers.

<b>Talk About the Other Team:</b> If your team isn’t winning, then talk about the team that is.  Is your team about to face off against the series leader?  Build some suspense by advertising both teams.  That way, you can attract transplants who aren’t rooting for your local team, plus people who just want to see a good game.

Even if your team isn’t winning any awards, your marketing efforts still can. [quote] It’s important for sports marketers to think creatively, and to capitalize on all sorts of opportunities that work to bring in players. [/quote]

Physician Marketing Techniques to Help Grow Your Practice,"Let’s face it – there are entire industries dedicated to physician marketing tactics.  Men and women across the country attend conferences to help learn about strategies for growing their practices.  But how many of these ideas are actually good?

If your current physician marketing strategy involves simply creating Facebook and Twitter accounts that you don’t use, then you may want to take some of these tips for marketing your physician practice.  These tried and true tips from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a> can help you steer your marketing efforts in the right direction.

<b>Make a Plan</b>: Develop a strategic plan for your practice by setting goals for your business.  If you want to reach out to a particular demographic, then work to ensure that you’re reaching them where they are – and they may or may not be on social networks.  If they are, then target them where they’re active – young mothers may spend hours on Facebook, while you may be more likely to engage with professional organizations on Twitter.

<b>Remember the End User</b>: In the end, marketing your practice should be about your patients, whether prospective or returning.  The more you can connect to them directly, the more they will feel connected to you, and will feel inspired to return to you time and again.  [quote] When developing a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy</a>, think about your patients – would they rather see a vague marketing postcard mixed in with their junk mail, or would they instead prefer an appointment reminder to be sent to them from your office directly through Twitter? [/quote]

<b>Blog about It</b>:  It’s true that blogs require substantial effort to create and maintain, but particularly for physicians who love to write, blogging can be a great way to connect with your readers.  Loyal patients will almost always want to know your opinions on subjects directly related to your line of work, and will be interested in the news and things that are around your office.  Plus, building a blog is a great way to create search engine optimized content, so that your practice will appear early in Google searches related to your field of practice.

<b>Be agile</b>:  The term “agile” made <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency’s</a> list of <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//blog/ad-lingo-101-the-newest-buzzwords-and-what-they-mean-to-your-company/"">marketing buzzwords</a>, and with good reason.  As the term implies, an agile marketing solution allows flexibility within your strategy.  Once you implement your strategy, pivoting courses allows you stay on top of trends to remain up with the times.  Mistakes are par for the course; if you’re not making mistakes, it typically means you’re not trying something new and innovative.  And, as the group at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando ad agency</a> knows, new and innovative is going to be what sets you apart from other physician practices.

As your practice continues to grow, you will likely see more and more of a need to adequately market your business.  If your business has an administrative staff, you may wish to train one of those individuals for the role of marketing coordinator to help oversee your company’s marketing efforts.  And, if you need to bring some fresh perspective to marketing your physician practice, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> is happy to offer some additional ideas on making effective use of your marketing resources.",,5/13/2013 10:06,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Physician-Marketing-Techniques-to-Help-Grow-Your-Practice.jpg,physician-marketing-techniques-to-help-grow-your-practice,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
What Do Don Draper and Thomas Edison Have in Common?,"Technology is moving at a phenomenal pace. Technologies we thought would never die are now obsolete, and the items that are here to stay have gotten fundamentally better in the past couple of decades.  The emergence of a technology-driven era shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.

Long ago, advertisers were responsible solely for creating content to be published in newspapers, magazines and, eventually, billboards and outdoor spaces.  While those media are shrinking as we make way for more effective (and often less expensive) digital advertising, these items still remain integral to a cohesive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">marketing strategy</a> for many businesses of all sizes.

However, at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we believe the role of the advertiser is changing.  Advertising now requires an understanding of how to leverage technology and data to help generate successful campaigns that reach the masses in unprecedented ways.  Granted, advertisers have always been on the forefront of technology, but these days, a cohesive advertising campaign requires more innovation than ever.

In boardrooms around the world, advertisers are already putting together initial plans to leverage advertising on Google Glass--product that didn’t even EXIST a month ago.  This is indicative of the challenges that advertisers will face going forward.  What comes next?  An Apple-driven way to change your brainwaves?  A way to tell your smart TV what you want to watch by simply looking at it?

[quote]The new role of an advertiser is that of a creative technologist. In the future, this role will dominate the advertising space. [/quote] A <a href=""http://youtu.be/nKIu9yen5nc"">recent video</a> from <a href=""http://www.code.org"">Code.org</a> shows Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg evangelizing the importance of coding as an invaluable skill set, as well as people like will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas, a notably unassuming advocate for digital development.

Advertisers who are not on the cutting edge of technology will be at a stark disadvantage if they fail to remain on the forefront of digital trends.  As such, it requires them to visionaries, implementing innovative products and services that create utility while instilling brand loyalty into their audience.  Advertising today requires knowledge and understanding of digital analytic data, as well as the means to understand the implications of that data and how to maneuver the digital terrain.

A <a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/02/advertisers_must_be_inventors.html"">recent blog post</a> on <a href=""http://www.hbr.org"">Harvard Business Review</a> propositions that advertisers need to be inventors.  They need to know what to build, how to build it and how optimize it for guaranteed results.  The thought process, therefore, is changing.  The dimensions, once limited to print surfaces, are now innumerable, with new products being invested every day.

The advertisers of the future are the people who are currently developing mobile apps to help solve problems in their everyday lives.  They are the ones who have clever ideas for new ways to use technology – and ACTUALLY act on them.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando advertising agency</a> encourages creativity in advertising my fostering contribution, by allowing everyone to contribute at every level of experience.  We strive to keep up with trends in digital technology, frequently attending showcases and networking events to learn about recent developments.

How are you fostering creativity in advertising at your business or agency?",,5/20/2013 9:25,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/What-Do-Don-Draper-and-Thomas-Edison-Have-in-Common-.jpg,what-do-don-draper-and-thomas-edison-have-in-common,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Four Tips for Restaurant Marketing and Social Media,"The marketers at the fast food chain restaurant <a href=""http://checkers.com"">Checkers</a> had it right back in 2000, when they introduced the slogan “You gotta eat.”  It’s true… Americans eat an average of three meals of day, spending an average of $2,700 per household eating out annually (and often times, even more in young, urban areas like Orlando, home to our Florida advertising agency).

If you’re a restaurant marketer, it may seem daunting to try to reach these people.  But if your restaurant hasn’t invested in a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a>, you may be hurting you chances of success.  It’s well known to marketers that people are more likely to try out new places based on recommendations from friends, and in this social age, it’s one of the best ways to get the word out.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Orlando advertising agency</a> has come up with four tasty tips to help use social media to drive people into your restaurant.
<h3>Remember, It's Not All About the Food</h3>
Okay, so to some degree, it IS all about the food.  The goal is to drive people into your restaurant, and to increase the bottom line.  But instead of thinking about social media in terms of return on investment, it’s more important to think about it in terms of return on relationship.

Restaurant marketers can do this by offering curated content that aligns with their customers’ lifestyles.  Followers of an organic restaurant might be interested to see photos of the farms where the chefs get their produce, while fans of a quirky hot dog stand might be more interested in reading about who won the Nathan’s hot dog eating contest in Coney Island.  The key is to know your audience, and to know their interests to better cater to them.

<h3>People are visual creatures, so show them what you're up to</h3>
A picture’s worth a thousand words, right?  Well, if not a thousand words, then at least a bunch of comments on Instagram.  After all, why do so many people use their expensive, high-resolution smartphone cameras to take photos of the pancakes they had for brunch?  It’s because images are better for capturing and parlaying an emotion, an impulse or a feeling.

While photos of food are great, it doesn’t have to stop there.  Just offering daily inspiration through a photo of a local mural, the kitchen team high-fiving or a couple of regulars sharing cocktails is enough to keep your followers and fans interested and engaged.
<h3>Listen to your followers</h3>
Social media offers great perspective to allow restaurant owners to hear what people are saying about their brands.  With <a href=""https://twitter.com/search-advanced"">Twitter Advanced Search</a>, <a href=""http://monitter.com/"">Monitter</a> and <a href=""http://socialmention.com/"">Social Mention</a>, there’s no reason not to listen in on the conversation.  (These are great resources to help keep an eye on your competitors as well.)

While a single customer service complaint may not be anything to be up in arms about, a string of similar responses may suggest you need to tweak something.  Show your followers you care by listening to them and answering their complaints.
<h3>Get creative</h3>
Your restaurant’s social media page is your page.  Try posting your favorite recipes, things you think your customers might enjoy, or even running a contest to encourage new subscribers and Twitter followers.   With technological advances expanding by leaps and bounds, there are thousands of ways that brands use Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Foursquare and a variety of other platforms to help connect with larger audiences.

Just as chefs get creative with the meals they serve, a restaurant social media team can get creative with the content it serves up to its followers.  For more novel ideas on how to best expand your restaurant’s social media outreach, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">contact us</a> today!",,6/4/2013 4:39,10,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Four-Tips-for-Restaurant-Marketing-and-Social-Media.jpg,four-tips-for-restaurant-marketing-and-social-media,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"It is finally here, Learn A New Way to Network: Quora","We live in an era dominated by social networks.  Not only are we all on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and many others, but we’re now <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">encountering web apps</a> that help narrow those social networks, including apps like <a href=""http://www.socialisting.com"">SocialListing</a> that uses your Facebook network as a personal marketplace.

Still, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando advertising agency</a> thinks there is still room for growth in the social networking field.  We believe that companies can do this through segmentation – rather than trying to get every person in the world on a given network, these companies can instead seek to connect like-minded people, in spite of whether they’re strangers, into a true online community.  In a sense, it’s practically reminiscent of the message boards functionality, which was once so popular amidst sub-segments of the population but are now barely active.

One new such competitor is <a href=""http://www.quora.com"">Quora</a>. Quora is, at its core, a question and answer service.  It allows people to post questions, and allows experts in their fields to post answers to those questions.  The best answers get upvoted, and the platform allows you to follow questions of interest.  This all happens on a platform where you are connected to your friends, colleagues and other connections.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a> finds Quora a fascinating platform for marketers and other professionals to grow their businesses.  As an established professional, you can seek to enhance your credibility and your reach through answering multiple questions and answers.  There seem to be relevant topics no matter what your field.  For example, looking through my personal Quora account, I see questions with titles such as:

-       <i>What are the most addictive loyalty programs?</i> (The crowd-sourced answers to this question would be great review for a marketer contemplating a new loyalty program!)

-        <i>What products have killer landing pages?</i> (Great for a designer trying to create a new landing page.)

-       <i>How do I get over my bad habit of procrastinating?</i>  (The author of the number one answer to this question currently has 8450 votes and—surprise!—a link to his personal self-help blog at the bottom of his question.)

It seems like such a simple premise, but the ability to crowdsource answers to difficult questions is a remarkable way to obtain expert knowledge and experience without having to go through the maze of searching through millions of relevant topics based on Google searches.  And, if you can also solidify yourself as an expert in your field, then Quora is a terrific way to parlay your expertise and experience on to people who may eventually become viewers of your content, professional connections, or, in some cases, even future customers.

While it’s easy to say that we’ve grown sick of being asked to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">join new social networks</a>, this one provides use to us in that (a) it’s not necessarily limited to your personal network, (b) the answers are crowdsourced, and (c) it facilitates active engagement.  Perhaps the third part is key; while sometimes we can create and maintain interaction through Facebook and Twitter, these sites don’t heavily rely on the interaction in the way that Quora does.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we think Quora offers a great new way for people to help expand their businesses while offering expert knowledge in their fields, which translates to more sales in the long run. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact us</a> today to determine how our team may assist you in allowing this social media tool to work for you!",,6/7/2013 9:01,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/06/A-New-Way-to-Network-Quora.jpg,a-new-way-to-network-quora,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"In a Digital World, Will a Real Estate Agent Become Obsolete?","With the rapid evolution of technology, jobs that used to require good old-fashioned human attention are now automatic, creating efficiency through high-tech, advanced computer programs. Conspiracy theorists speak of the “rise of the robots,” like something out of the 1990s trilogy <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)""><i>The Matrix</i></a>.

Today, searching for a new home can be as simple as a Google search.  Key in a few target words, and you can find side-by-side listings, complete with features and price assessments. As such, many people may be left wondering: What is the value of a real estate agent?  If sellers can easily put their homes on the market with a few clicks of a button, and buyers can peruse listings from the comfort of their homes, then why invest the time and money to work with a middleman to help broker a deal?

Throughout the past decade, the role of a real estate agent has shifted dramatically.  Whereas once real estate agents were the primary lifeblood of the industry, with their fingers on the pulse of markets, prices and top investments, many of these traditional functions are no longer necessary due to technological advances.

Of course, it’s not that simple.  Even in a world where everything is automatic, a good real estate agent offers a goldmine of expertise.  Like with any service industry, it pays to have an expert to help.  A seasoned expert can help a purchaser navigate the difficult terrain of the home buying process, or can help a seller get the best price for his or her investment.  Part professional marketer, part community expert and part customer service representative, the real estate agent must be able to solve problems on the fly and be able to effectively communicate with clients.

Notably, many real estate agents and agencies have fallen behind in keeping up with technology.  The average age of a real estate agent is 55 years old, meaning that some more mature agents may not be keeping up with the rapid changes in the technological landscape.  Therefore, real estate agents who are able to use a variety of services have a distinct advantage over their competitors.

Rather then expressing concern about their jobs becoming obsolete, real estate agents should instead leverage new technologies for their own advantage.  For example, potential buyers who can see side-by-side listings may not understand the nuances of legal language, discrepancies in prices, or the added value of certain home features.

Real estate marketers who strive to keep up with new technologies can better communicate with potential clients.  For example, a commercial real estate agent trying to build rapport with a foreign investor may wish to communicate via Skype, as the simulation of face-to-face context offers psychological advantages in terms of positive interactions.

Data management tools for realtors can also increase efficiency.  Calendar invitations are superior organizational tools to monthly planners, as they easily facilitate email reminders, mapping features and a host of other options.

The team here at our <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//"">Florida advertising agency</a> depends on our real estate agents to advise us when making informed choices about home buying and selling.  While some agents may fear their jobs are in jeopardy, we believe that our real estate agents, guided by changes in digital technology, will always be there to offer a personal interaction to help address our real estate needs.

Why Real Estate Agents Should Focus on Content Strategy,"A good real estate agent is a master of self-promotion.  Unfortunately, navigating the difficult terrain between effective promotion and pompousness can be challenging.  The best realtors act as salespeople without coming across too strong.

In a digital era where people rely on Google, Facebook and Twitter to transmit information, one of the most effective ways to do this is to develop a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content strategy</a> to increase exposure, which helps an agent to create and maintain a pipeline of clients.  Real estate agents who implement content strategies can expect to gain leads in the following ways:

<b>Expertise:</b>  Potential clients expect real estate agents to know a lot about a breadth of subjects pertaining to the industry.  Therefore, agents who can show that they know a great deal about such subjects are able to establish expertise, which results in increased influence.  And, once a real estate agent has built up a reputation an expert, more people will be inclined to seek out that agent when searching for a home.  With enough expertise, an agent may even be invited to speak on radio shows and at seminars, which again can help build the agent’s number of referrals.

<b>SEO:</b> A solid content strategy is great for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO purposes</a>.  On an average Google search, eighteen percent of clicks go to the number one ranked article, while only 1% go to the number ten ranked article.  This shows the power of having a high-ranking webpage on Google.  In order to increase visibility in search, realtors can write articles that emphasize popular keyword searches.  Content marketers can find out what keywords are popular using the <a href=""https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS"">Google Adwords Keyword Tool</a>, and can tailor their content to such searches.  For example, if the search term “Orlando real estate” is extremely popular, it may be hard to achieve a top ranking.  But, a term such as “Orlando real estate marketing” may be less popular, and may be a better keyword topic if you’re trying to improve your rankings.  A full overview of SEO rankings is available <a href=""http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo"">here.</a>

<b>Repeated Exposure:</b>  Maintaining an active content strategy provides repeated exposure for the real estate agent.  It allows the real estate agent to promote his or her services without seeming pompous.  Maintaining a flow of interesting content leaves lasting associations in potential clients’ minds. Continuous updates are a great way to stay visible, allowing the agent to remain on a potential client’s radar long after the initial interaction.

<b>Email Lists, Twitter and Facebook:</b>  An effective content strategy can help build the agent build her fan base.  This can lead to more opportunities to reach out to potential customers through email marketing, Twitter and Facebook.

Most real estate business comes from the agent’s ability to get into, and remain in, potential customers’ minds.  The more ways the agent can do this, the more potential for home buying and selling opportunities.  This, paired with perceived expertise, results not only in more clients, but also in quality clients.

Marketing Is Now Smarter with Business Intelligence,"Business intelligence sounds like something out of a spy movie.  Throw in a few fancy gadgets and an alpha male protagonist, and it could be the premise for the next James Bond flick.  In actuality, the practices associated with business intelligence may not, at least on the surface level, be as glamorous as the plot of <i>Skyfall</i>.  But, with effective business intelligence practices, companies can make strategic decisions that result in savings of thousands or even millions of dollars over time… and THAT sounds pretty glamorous, now doesn’t it?  The folks at our Florida advertising agency think so!

First of all, let’s talk about what business intelligence actually means.  According to Wikipedia, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence"">business intelligence</a> is “a set of theories, methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information for business purposes.”  Put in plain English, that means using data to make factually based business decisions.

It often surprises me how many business owners neglect to put business intelligence at the core of otherwise sophisticated marketing strategies.  They’ll hire marketers to spend thousands of dollars on campaigns, only to find themselves on the losing end of a major marketing push because the marketing team didn’t take the time to assess the ways in which people interact with their brands.

Successful companies <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">analyze business intelligence</a> at both micro and macro levels.  On a micro level, analysts can pinpoint exactly what steps an individual used to make a purchase, from that person’s first impression to what drove his or her impulse to make a purchase.

On a larger level, business intelligence analysts can explain trends across time.  Why do sales suddenly spike at a particular department store during the fall?  What will the financial standing of the company be in a decade?  This kind of information helps businesses executives make smart choices about where to allocate resources, and where to pull the plug.

Of course, business intelligence practices almost always hinge on the quality of the data.  How can business owners be sure they’re capturing the correct data about the correct consumers and practices?  In some cases, this comprises an entire subfield of business intelligence.  After all, it’s worthless for a company to have a lot of information about the wrong type of consumer.

So how can a team of executives gain business intelligence insights?  Typically, marketers collect and store this information through a mix of spreadsheets, reporting software, digital dashboards and other systems.  These tools range from simple to complex, and offer <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">insights</a> into a range of information about user behavior.  Sometimes this extends into internal practices as well.

The business intelligence field is vast, and there’s always a new way to approach the data.  But, a strong team of strategists on your side can help you sift through the junk, in order to find the information you need.

Sophisticated business intelligence practices can help a marketing team design a digital strategy that helps the business reach out directly to a target group, in ways that emphasize the ways in which those individuals consume. However, it takes significant skill to be able to effectively gauge and predict the outcome of campaigns based on business intelligence data.  If you’re struggling with how to help boost your bottom line using business intelligence insights, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> has a few ideas to help your organization thrive!  We do this for companies and organizations all over the country, let us help yours.",,6/24/2013 7:30,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Marketing-Smarter-With-Business-Intelligence.jpg,marketing-smarter-with-business-intelligence,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Content Strategy Tips for Real Estate Agents You Need To Know,"You’ve read our previous post about the importance of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content strategy</a> for real estate agents, and you’ve decided it’s time to get started in growing your business through content marketing.  But, this beckons another important question:  What types of content should you provide?

In tackling this question, it is important to look to matters of time and budget.  A real estate agent’s time can be limited, and realtors often find themselves trying to squeeze out a few minutes between back-to-back client meetings and an afternoon open house.  Luckily, for time-crunched real estate professionals, there are a variety of services to help increase efficiency.  For instance, agents can virtual assistant via Task Rabbit can help <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">manage social media accounts</a>, while a freelancer via <a href=""https://www.elance.com/"">eLance</a> can assist with generating content for your blog.  Agents looking to develop a top-tier content strategy can <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">contact our Florida advertising agency</a> to learn more about the best methods to grow their business by optimizing return on investment.

Content strategy should be budgeted as part of overall marketing costs.  If hundreds of postcards and expensive stationery aren’t generating results, consider investing those costs instead into digital strategy.  Certain blogging networks like <a href=""https://wordpress.com/"">WordPress</a> allow users to build for free, and allow them to host blogs on their own domains, which individuals can acquire for just a few dollars a month.

Here are some content opportunities to consider while developing content strategy.

<b>Blog Networks:</b>  Blogging networks are great starting points for real estate agents interested in building their practices.  Realtors can offer expertise about the state of the local market and other topics of interest to potential buyers and sellers.

<b>Facebook:</b>  For some real estate agents, it may help to have both a personal page and a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business"">business page</a>.  On the business page, realtors can showcase new listings, offer caption contests with small prizes as rewards, and post trivia about local neighborhoods.  Agents can also use Facebook to link to blogs posts, exposing these posts to a broader audience.

<b>Twitter:</b> Twitter is a quick and easy way to send a message, and the 140-character limit ensure short, concise updates.  Try using Twitter to link to your blog and to link to new listings.

<b>Quora:</b>  Quora is a great tool for industry experts.  The allows individuals to anonymously ask questions about topics of interest to them, and allows others to answer.  Each time an individual answers a question, the site lists the answerer’s credentials, plus links to any website or other information that professional provides.  This is a great resource for real estate agents, as some of the questions are specific to localities (check out <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Orlando-FL/What-are-some-nice-suburban-neighborhoods-towns-around-Orlando-FL"">this listing of nice neighborhoods around Orlando</a>, and think about how a real estate agent might be able to provide expert advice).

<b>LinkedIn:</b>  LinkedIn is the number one site for business networking.  Again, it’s a place where real estate agents can share links to their blogs and other content.  However, LinkedIn also makes the referral process much easier.  If a second-degree connection is looking for a home, and a first-degree connection sees it, then that person can easily refer the potential client to you through a LinkedIn introduction.

<b>YouTube:</b>  More commonly known for dancing hamster videos, YouTube is actually a great resource for DIY instructional films and informative videos.  A real estate agent can create web videos cheaply and quickly to answer questions common to their field.

If done correctly, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> can help real estate agents build stronger, more fulfilling practices.  For more information about how our Orlando marketing agency can help you develop and implement your content strategy for optimal results, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">contact us</a> for a consultation.",,6/27/2013 6:56,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Content-Strategy-Tips-for-Real-Estate-Agents.jpg,content-strategy-tips-for-real-estate-agents,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

The rest of America enthusiastically celebrates freedom on July 4th, the day the draft of the Declaration of Independence was approved. Americans celebrate this day with red, white, and blue, stars and stripes, fireworks, and cookouts.

Why Sports Marketers Should Target Influencers For Their Brand,"Nearly every professional sports team has at least a few die-hard fans, the types of fans who hold season tickets and will tell you that they haven’t missed a game in over two years.  These are the fans who are happy and relieved when their teams win, but become physically angry when their teams lose.  Regardless, they’ll stick by their teams through thick and thin, based on deep-seated loyalty that may go back generations.

Unfortunately, most sports fans are not like that.  Many will express undying love for their favorite teams, only to stop watching when their teams are having a rough season.  Others are fair weather fans, fans who only seem to care about sports when their local team makes it into the playoffs.

For sports marketers, it may be tempting to go after the moderate fans, and direct efforts toward people who are not already coming to games and showing support for their teams.  The die-hard fans are already going to the games, spending money, and showing support, so it makes sense that they’d be a low priority…. right?

Perhaps that was the case back before social media became integral to our everyday lives.  But these days, your die-hard fans can also be your biggest brand ambassadors.  A sports franchise doesn’t need to unload its entire marketing budget on getting fair weather fans to invest in sports…their die hard fans can do it for them!

Take, for example, the <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/fancave/#fbid=fh7vTrrw7xA"">MLB Fan Cave</a>, located at 4<sup>th</sup> Street and Broadway in New York City.  Through an online contest that involved Facebook sharing, tweeting and voting, a handful of baseball super fans won the opportunity to spend baseball season in the MLB Fan Cave.  There, they’ll watch every single baseball game while tweeting and sharing their thoughts to their followers.  They’ll also have the opportunity to meet celebrities, watch in-store performances, and to otherwise have the once-in-a-lifetime experience of being a brand ambassador to the MLB.

The MLB Fan Cave Twitter account has a quarter million followers, and looks to only amass more as the season continues.  These super fans are also creating content for their own Twitter, Instagam and Facebook accounts, as well as contributing to the MLB Fan Cave blog, writing about a range of subjects, such as <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/fancave/blog.jsp?content=article&amp;content_id=44309616#fbid=fh7vTrrw7xA"">MLB Tattoos</a>.

These super fans are valuable to MLB because of their status as influencers.  The genius marketers at the MLB knew that by choosing people through a series of online votes, they’d effectively choose people who already had strong social networks, paired with the ability to effectively market themselves.

Sites like <a href=""https://klout.com/home"">Klout</a> are designed to realize the importance of influencer behavior to marketers, a field which will only continue to grow.  Marketers have long known that word-of-mouth marketing is the best form of marketing, and a program like the MLB Fan Cave is an excellent way for a big brand to garner publicity while letting its franchise fans do the work for them.

So, for sports marketers who think that marketing to the super fan isn’t the right consumer tier in order to help grow the business, it’s important to remember that the these super fans can be your biggest advocates.  It looks like team that created the MLB Fan Cave have hit a home run.

Recognize The Importance of Seeding A Branded Video,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com"">YouTube</a> is a fascinating website.  Make a hit, and you might have exposure to more than a billion people.  But, make a dud (or even a good video that just doesn’t get any traction) and you may find yourself out thousands of dollars, with little to show.

That’s because there’s a science to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">creating and seeding a digital video</a>.  It seems easy enough – make something hilarious, share it with your friends, and then they’ll share it with their friends – but unfortunately, that’s not actually the way it works in the real world.

Successful videos reach viewers on an emotional level.  When videos capture an emotion, people are more likely to share, comment and engage with the content.  There are some exceptions – for example, how-to videos tend to be extremely popular ways to market technical devices – but the trends show that sharing behavior occurs when people feel more emotionally connected to a video.

Humor is obviously a great reason to share a video.  In fact, branded or not branded, most of the videos that come up in my Facebook feed are humorous.  But, a <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unrulymedia.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcustom_page%2FSVLbrochureweb_0.pdf&amp;ei=-vkGUY-NHeeW0QGfy4DQCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFnAcm0JkYKzQ9-XZcVT_ObUvOGXA&amp;sig2=IjtwFhOH07DQ6v2q5eu69w&amp;bvm=bv.41524429,d.dmQ&amp;cad=rja"">recent white paper</a> from <a href=""http://www.unrulymedia.com/"">Unruly Media</a> shows that people are even more inclined to share uplifting videos – the types that make people feel happy or inspired.

Also, another tip: if a video is good, the amount of branding doesn’t seem to matter. This popular video from Chipotle, a personal favorite of mine, lists the Chipotle brand only within the last 30 seconds of the video.  Without that, you would never know it is a Chipotle video.

But, it not just the content that helps sell the video… it’s also the way you seed it.

In the days of YouTube, it’s hard to get any video seen through all the rest of the things that are out there.  According to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics"">most recent data from Google</a>, more than 72 hours of video content are uploaded every minute.  That is A LOT of video!  And, let’s be honest… a lot of it is garbage.

Because so much of it is trash, it’s hard to get the good stuff to the surface.  But, there are strategies to help you seed your video.  You can buy sponsored placement on YouTube, or, if you opt to house your video on a server outside YouTube, you may have even more authority to place it wherever you want. Advertisers can put video ads on a number of media sites, as companies such as AOL and <a href=""http://advertising.gawker.com/"">Gawker Media</a> have places for branded video content.

Also, if your aim is to create content that people will share, then it is essential to make it easy to share. Top marketing executives know that they should put social share buttons right next to the video, as people are typically logged in to their social networks when viewing, and simplifying the sharing process makes it more likely that people will share the content.

Understanding How Young People Use Technology Today,"Sometimes, the rapid speed of technology makes me feel older than my years (and I’m not even that old!).  Back in my day, we didn’t have tablets or smart phones – most people didn’t even have computers.  We had to communicate to one another by dialing them on a home phone, and, if my parents couldn’t reach me because I wasn’t where I said I was going to be, then I would be in big trouble when I got home.

But things have changed a lot since then, and parents have lots of ways to keep track of their children.  Young people communicate through text messaging, preferring that method over email due to its convenience.  They don’t even really have to learn handwriting – they’re practically born with keyboards in their hands.  Even when dealing with a slightly older generation, some of the 20-somethings I know don’t even own televisions, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">since they get all of their media from the computer</a>.

Interesting to think about, isn’t it?  These technologies that once were innovative and paved the future for us are now barely even relevant.  That’s why, as someone who works within digital media, I find it important to keep up with the newest technology – to play with it, own it and learn how to use it.

While TV is not dying anytime soon (how could it, with so many baby boomers who’ve grown up with televisions?), it’s important to take notice of the ways young people use, engage with and interact with technology.  This is a new generation, full of young people who are “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">digital natives</a>.”  And, the disconnect is clear: while some marketers and advertisers have found ways to reach these people, lots of digital media initiatives still miss the mark.

For instance, I go on YouTube all the time, but I couldn’t name a single YouTube celebrity without the help of our marketing interns.  But they point me to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/RayWilliamJohnson"">Ray William Johnson</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/dailygrace"">Daily Grace</a>, both of whom are completely unrecognizable to parents, yet have millions of teen/young adult followers on the internet.

Or, take the popularity of mobile gaming.  Some people I know play games like Tetris or Bejeweled on their mobile devices, but young people take mobile gaming to a whole new level.  Through role-playing games that contain a social component, they can interact with an entire new world where in-game currency can be exchanged for real-life currency.

(And that DEFINITELY didn’t exist when I was a kid!)

If you work for a brand and are aiming to ramp up your digital presence, it is essential to keep track of the newest gadgets, games and trends in technology.  With an abundance of blogs like <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/"">Gizmodo</a> and <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/"">TechCrunch</a>, there’s no reason that marketers can’t be in touch with the ways that young people use tech.

As you’re planning your digital strategy, I encourage marketers to look toward the future.  With more technologies becoming widely available each day, it’s important to carefully plan your strategy to ensure that it’s <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">reaching the audience</a> where they are.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Orlando marketing agency</a> advises you to spend a little bit of time getting to know what’s new in technology, in order to help gap between digitally divided generations.",,7/18/2013 11:50,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Digitally-Divided-Understanding-How-Young-People-Use-Technology.jpg,understanding-how-young-people-use-technology,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
What is Old is now New: Learn Museum Marketing in 2013,"You walk into a museum, and you find yourself surrounded with relics from the world around you.  Sure, you can experience each item by looking at it, and you can even go on a tour.  But what if you could experience the entire process using interactive features that embrace technology, by using your iPad or your smartphone?

Museum marketers are catching on to the fast-paced changes in digital technology, and are finding creative ways to leverage innovation to create an enhanced museum experience.  Whereas once museum artifacts were stuck between the confines of a building dedicated solely to housing the items, today’s museums can reach people on their computers, smartphones and tablets.  Such museum marketing efforts are blurring the lines between marketing and curating.

Here’s a quick run down of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency’s</a> favorite ways museum marketers are embracing digital technology.

<b>Content Creation:</b> Keeping and maintaining a regular blog helps not only inform potential visitors of museum happenings, but also helps bolster <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> rankings and search engine visibility.  A blog need not be limited to museum events; marketers can also use it to provide historical information about current exhibits and other materials of interest to the local community.

<b>Social Media:</b> While these days, most museum marketers are savvy enough to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">keep active Facebook and Twitter pages</a>, marketers at some of the nation’s leading museums are taking social media to a new level.  For instance, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has a <a href=""http://pinterest.com/metmuseum/"">massive Pinterest presence</a>, using the social media platform to share beautiful images from its various collections.  The Brooklyn Museum website uses the Foursquare API to highlight its guests’ activities, and to display images of each of the museum’s visitors.  It also highlights the museum’s Foursquare mayors, both past and present.

<b>Press Releases:</b> Even small museums can benefit big time by using press release wire services to help distribute news and information about upcoming museum events.  Press release wire services reach thousands of people in an instant, and most of these people are journalists who are hungry for stories.  Additionally, press release wire services increase search engine visibility and help expose museum news to audiences that would not have seen it otherwise.  While press release services are not fail-safe, they are a great tool for museum marketers.

<b>Interactivity:</b> Even with limited budgets, most museums can afford to design simple apps to help visitors tour the museum, either in-person or virtually, from the comfort of their homes.  However, with bigger budgets, there are endless possibilities to create games and interactive exhibits.  For instance, the Smithsonian museum offers <a href=""http://www.mnh.si.edu/panoramas/"">virtual tours</a> and <a href=""http://www.gosmithsonian.com/scvngr/"">mobile scavenger hunts</a>.

As digital technology allows more and more opportunities for growth, museums will undoubtedly be on the forefront of embracing the changes that affect the world around us. This means that we can expect to see complex and advanced marketing strategies for development within the museum marketing.  The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> believes that as the world becomes more tech-friendly, the possibilities for museum marketers will be greater than ever before.

While many have historically been open to the public for years, finding new and innovative means to capitalize on effective museum marketing strategies requires the expertise of a trusted agency partner.

Is Your Marketing Campaign Mom-Friendly? Learn Why It Should Be,"<b></b>Over the past two decades, Moms have controlled up to 80% of household spending. When you break it down, they are not only buying for themselves but for many other age groups and demographics including adults, babies, tweens, teens, males and females. By putting in some consideration and tailoring your marketing campaigns to fit this influential consumer group, you could reap quite the harvest in customer conversion and tap into a market that will keep giving.

As a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising agency</a> we make sure our clients consider the demographic they are marketing to. If the age range or product falls anywhere close to the “Mom” demographic, we like to ask the following questions as we develop or critique an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">existing marketing campaign</a>:

<b>Question 1:</b><i> Are my marketing campaigns easy to read and navigate on a mobile phone?</i>

From juggling careers, family schedules and keeping the home in order, Moms are always on the go and use their trusty mobile sidekicks to keep up the pace. According to BabyCenter's September 2012 Media Mom Report, 65% of moms have smart phones (38% higher than the general US population). Quick, easy and straightforward is the name of the game when you’re dealing with Moms and mobile media. In fact, BabyCenter's monthly poll states 91% of smartphone equipped Moms expect <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">websites to be mobile friendly</a>.
<h3>Pay specific attention to:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li>Clear click-through links: Consider the webpage that your ad, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">email campaign</a> or image may link them to. Does it bring the audience straight to the desired destination? Or does it lead them to a home page that they would have to scroll through to find the information or product?</li>
 	<li>Mobile visuals: How does it visually look on the phone? Is the image clear? Is the color scheme eye-catching and easily understandable?</li>
 	<li>Clear call to action: Does the content clearly and concisely state what you would like them to do? For example: “Click Here to Order.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<b>Question 2:</b> <i>What kind of woman am I marketing to?</i>

Stereotypes and assumptions of a Mom’s role can often be detrimental to a marketing campaign if skewed in the wrong direction. Mothers no longer fit within the “Leave it To Beaver” role these days and are sometimes categorized somewhere between stressed and tired or on an episode of Real Housewives. The truth is that Mom’s are women first, modern, forward thinking women who have added responsibilities like children, a spouse and other family members. Mom-hood doesn’t change the fact that they are still women and want to feel beautiful, empowered and all around badass, plus able to cook a mean grilled cheese sandwich.

<b>Question 3:</b><i> Just how social is my marketing campaign?</i>

Moms are all about relationships and look to social sites like Facebook that promote that relational connection. In fact most Moms spend their socializing time on Facebook because of the information and content sharing capabilities between friends and family. Twitter has been found to be more influential with the tech savvy and higher wage-earning Mom. To reach the mainstream Mom market, use Facebook for social promotions and talk to those Moms because they are certainly talking too.

New Networking Strategies for Building Connections,"Nearly every day, on websites as varied as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/"">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/"">Psychology Today</a>, I see emphasis on the importance of building your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">networking strategies</a> in order to further career and business opportunities.  There is a significant level of truth in the old adage that: It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.  People I’ve known in my life have gotten opportunities based on pure nepotism, beating out other completely qualified individuals just because they had an “in” with the company.

But, is that necessarily a bad thing?  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida advertising agency</a> doesn’t think so!

It’s true that some people are just better at networking than others.  Smart, savvy, charismatic people will generally have more opportunities than intelligent introverts, primarily because of their inherent abilities to connect with others.

However, networking can be daunting, time consuming and difficult.  It’s hard to know whether the person you shake hands with at a cocktail party could be the person to eventually contract your company for a multi-million dollar development project.  While it may seem impossible, it’s exactly what happened to startups like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""https://www.zynga.com/games/draw-something"">OMG Pop</a> (creators of the mobile game <i>Draw Something</i>!).

So, maybe you’re trying everything – emails to school alumni, networking events and LinkedIn introductions – but nothing’s working.  What are some new ways to network? Well, the following includes a list of a few nifty networking ideas, gathered from some of the savviest people I know:
<h3>Host an Influencer Party:</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">Influencers are hugely important</a> to the marketing ecosystem.  Influencers can act as advocates for your business or brand, and being associated with an influencer (or, even better, a group of influencers) can help build your business and connect you with the big leagues.

Many influencers do not know one another, and hosting a party to bring influencers together can be a great way to gain traction with people who matter most.  Furthermore, if you run a medium or large business, you can use social media listening techniques to discover who the biggest advocates are for your brand, and you can invite them to exclusive events to help unveil new products and services.
<h3>Create (and Maintain) Dialogue Online:</h3>
One of the perils of living in a connected world is that sometimes, we can’t keep up with everything.  Therefore, it can be tempting for a person to fail to respond to tweets and Facebook status updates on a personal account.  But emphasizing this as part of your networking and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">growth strategy</a> will ultimately help grow your business.  Even though the person at the other side of the screen may be a person you’ve only met a few times, a semi-public exchange of ideas can help reinforce your public image in that person’s mind, as well as in the minds of common connections.  The magic of these social networking sites is that anyone you choose can listen to your conversation and add input as they please.  Responding to these people to keep the dialogue growing is an essential networking skill.
<h3>Focus on the Connections You Already Have:</h3>
Invest some time and energy into maintaining the connections you already have rather than seeking new ones.  By remembering to follow up, scheduling coffee dates with interesting people, and showing interest in others’ projects, you are helping solidify your personal connections.

These connections can then help reinforce your network with several strong ties, instead of many weak ones.  Then, when possible, try to bring these networks together, facilitating introductions and helping others in need.  You’ll be surprised how quickly people will be willing to reciprocate your efforts.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we believe networking is one of the best ways to help grow your business.  Building a strong network takes more than a few emails and business cards… it requires permanent commitment and dedication. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact us</a> to discuss additional opportunities to generate buzz for your brand via capitalizing on your trusted connections!

Why Follow-for-Follow Creates an Inauthentic Brand Experience,"Outside of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketing</a>, I hear it everywhere.  “Follow me, and I’ll follow you back!” and advice suggesting that a Twitter user follow every one of their own followers.  Usually, this is the type of thing said by motivational speakers, life coaches and other types of people who don’t truly understand marketing.

To some people, a Twitter follow-for-follow seems like an even exchange.  Or, perhaps it just seems like “the nice thing to do” in order to help please your customers and loyal fans.  But unfortunately, a follow-for-follow pattern can also result in tarnishing your brand’s image and brand experience.

First of all, it’s important to remember that your followers can see who you follow.  If you end up being followed by a spam or ghost account, and you follow them blindly, you are, at the very least, subjecting yourself to spam.  But, you’re also providing incentives for your own followers – the people you influence – to follow spam or fake accounts, which doesn’t seem good for anyone.

Much in the way that it doesn’t make sense for <a href=""http://pepsi.com"">Pepsi</a> to follow <a href=""http://cocacola.com"">Coke</a>, or for <a href=""http://mercedes-benz.com"">Mercedes Benz</a> to follow <a href=""http://kia.com"">Kia</a>, it doesn’t make sense for your brand to follow the things that aren’t on-brand.  Sure, you may love the tweets from your friend Albert who constantly tweets funny comments about celebrity gossip, but if your company doesn’t align itself with celebrity culture, then it’s better to keep that follow to your own personal account.

A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">good brand influences</a> behavior, and if you don’t want to dilute the value of your brand, it’s important to realize that the brand’s Twitter page (and Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram pages) are extensions of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand identity</a>.  In many ways, it’s like aligning yourself with the people you believe you are aligned with – and just because a million people may identify with your brand, it doesn’t necessarily mean your brand needs to cater to them.

Perhaps when the Twitterverse was smaller, it may have made more sense to follow each person who followed you or your brand.  But, with more than 200 million active users as of this month, it’s easy for bigger brands to get lost in the haze.  Imagine being Lady Gaga and trying to follow each of your 39 million followers.  Even she follows some 136,000 people, which seems to me like it would make it hard to sift through the noise.

Another trend that we’ve seen marketers attempt in order to be more successful on Twitter is the practice of buying followers.  All over the internet, people are eager to help businesses raise their Twitter fan bases by purchasing followers at an agreed-upon sum.  However, our team of genuine marketing experts frowns upon this practice because ultimately it doesn’t matter who your followers are if they’re not quality, and are not actively engaging with you.  Additionally, while some people assume that buying followers will help bolster their credibility, in actuality there are now a variety of social media tools that help shed light on fake followers.

Social Networking & its Effect on the Ind. Restaurant Industry,"<div>

According to <a href=""http://www.restaurant.org"">www.restaurant.org</a>, America’s restaurant industry currently employs 12.9 million people—10% of our overall workforce—and more than 970,000 dining establishments serve some 130 million hungry mouths per day. That’s a lot of “order ups.” While there’s no arguing the prolific nature of the business, there also exists a widely held belief amongst independent practitioners that if you toss your hat in the ownership ring, you should expect to get burned. Rookie pratfalls such as liquor license issues or frivolous use of working capital can crush a good concept.  Avoiding the lick of the flame means running a tight ship in the beginning stages so as to bolster initial impressions (that inevitably end up online) by laymen and professional critics alike. These unsolicited opinions act as free advertising and they should be used to the fullest.

An August, 2011 <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-restaurants-fail-rate-2011-8?op=1"">Business Insider</a> article does a good job of uncovering the perils of New York City’s fickle hospitality marketplace. The story states that of the one thousand or so restaurants opened in New York City in 2010, 80% should expect to shutter their doors in five years time. For those remaining 20%, the race to collect on a massive profit margin buoyed by the cities some 9 million grumbling bellies is treacherous and uphill. The same statistic generally applies to the rest of the nation as well.

Numerous factors can account for a food establishment’s ultimate failure: things like poor heath inspection scores, a sparsely trafficked location, obscene rent charges and negative reviews. That last point may cause the most detrimental blow of all. In our “every (wo)man’s voice must be heard” culture, a single star snub by just a handful of unsatisfied Yelp.com reviewers is enough to spell lights out for underperforming establishments.

<a href=""http://yelp.com"">Yelp.com,</a> a social networking site with content comprised of user reviews related to local services (21% are restaurant reviews), receives more than 71 million monthly unique visitors. And it’s not alone. Similar sites that allow users to provide their own feedback and rankings include Zagat, UrbanSpoon, TripAdvisor, CitySearch, Google Places and a whole slew of others.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Marketing agencies in large metropolitan cities</a>—like New York and Orlando—whose economic ebbs and flows are so directly tied to the successes and failures of their hospitality network, know the importance of helping to further a restaurant’s reputation online. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida advertising firms</a> study reports, like the one on Yelp presented by Harvard Business School’s Michael Luca in September of 2011. Unique among Luca’s findings is that “online consumer reviews substitute for more traditional forms of reputation.”  He goes on to clarify, “Because consumers have more information about chains than about independent restaurants, one might expect Yelp to have a larger effect on independent restaurants. My results demonstrate that despite the large impact of Yelp on revenue for independent restaurants; the impact is statistically insignificant and close to zero for chains.”

This conclusion makes logical sense, however, it means that mom and pop shops who stand on precarious footing to begin with now must bare their knickers before a scrutinizing public. While the adage <i>any publicity is good publicity </i>still holds true for smaller companies with limited upstart working capital, the double edge sword is this: free publicity can’t be controlled or monitored so the key is to get it right the first time or fall prey to the wolves in foodie clothing.

Viral Videos: Creating Videos People Love & Will Share,"Flu season is upon us and the <a href=""http://www.nih.gov"">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) says the number of recorded cases this year has already reached epidemic proportions. The team at our Orlando advertising agency has received office-wide preventative vaccines so <i>shoo flu, don’t bother us! </i>

<i> </i>We hardly take the potential severity of Influenza lightly, but we can’t help but compare the virus’s widespread impact to another virus; a promotional technique for which there is no known prophylactic: viral video marketing. The term stems from the idea that if an ad reaches a “susceptible” user, that user becomes “infected” (i.e. accepts the idea), shares what they’ve seen with others, others do the same and so on and so forth.

Viral Videos—VV’s we’ll call them—are a relatively new phenomenon owing their exponentially increasing presence to YouTube’s 2005 launch. Not all VVs contain a marketing component, but for the purposes of this extremely well written and thought-out blog piece, we’re only interested in those that do.

One of the first VV campaigns was released even before it had broadly <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">reaching social platforms</a> like YouTube and Reddit at its disposal.  Recorded way back in 1995 A.D.—the same year O.J. was on trial and Alicia Silverstone played Cher in <i>Clueless, </i>the greatest cinematic masterpiece of the 20th century— Loronix Information Systems released an innovative ad promoting surveillance computers. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrl9rnstSU0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">THIS CLIP</a> features a distraught, overweight cubicle worker with a case of misplaced rage.

The clip played on one of the most important aspects of VV marketing. Just like the first rule of Fight Club, “You do not talk about Fight Club,” the first rule of VV marketing is making sure not to make transparent an intention to sell a product or service. For a video to even be considered “viral,” the litmus test is 100,000 views within a 24-hour span—anything less than that, and it falls into the much lesser “cough due to cold” category.  In order to reach such lofty numbers without seeking “seeding help” from companies like Pimp My Views or View Tornado, a VV must first and foremost entertain.

A recent<i> Forbes</i> article calls this approach “Candy with the Medicine,” a philosophy that recognizes a message is best received within entertainment. So, focusing first on the entertainment value (the candy) and then following with the message (the medicine) is the only way to ensure maximum results. From an application standpoint, which would you rather watch? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajJP8AmkFLU"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">THIS</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqzxAaWktXQ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">THIS</a>?

The first is part of a series of Old Spice commercials developed by Oregon ad agency, Wieden and Kennedy. Titled “Believe in your Smelf” it’s a follow-up to “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” which received 40 million YouTube views in 12 months, leading to a Twitter following increase of 2700%, a Facebook interaction increase of 800% and an overall sales of Old Spice body wash 107% increase. The second clip is a more traditional, jingle reliant commercial.  It also happens to be one of the most obnoxious, ear gratingly, jaw grindingly, amateur spectacles ever to come out of New York.  It shoves the “message” down the consumer’s throat while casting the “entertainment” portion of the model to the wayside. In summation, the first example makes viewers laugh; the second doubtless forces them question the future prospects of the human race.

Viral Videos: providing hope for humanity.

 	<li>Create a press packet that has the background story of your business, what you offer, why you are unique, plus images that showcase your business. Send this packet along with your initial email for bloggers to get a handle on your business and also use the content for the blog itself.</li>
 	<li>Invite a blogger to enjoy a free dinner, one night at your hotel, etc. in exchange for a mention in their travel diary. Bloggers love being able to experience all things first-hand.</li>
 	<li>Not only can bloggers offer a write up about your business, they can also offer advertising. Consider purchasing ad space from a blogger that shares the same target audience as you and take advantage of their online traffic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get Social</h3>
Remember it’s all about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">connecting with the customer</a>. The more communicative and personal your business is, the more a customer will feel comfortable buying into what your company has to offer. Start a Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and even a blog account to start the buzz about your business and add some personality.

Here are just a few ideas of how you can use social media to boost sales:
<ul>
 	<li>Post images and tips about other local spots that guests can enjoy while visiting your business-it may strike up some B2B relationships with other local businesses and will definitely boost your audience’s engagement with your business and local community.</li>
 	<li>Use these social media hubs as a platform for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">promotional campaigns</a>. Run a holiday special for just Twitter and Facebook users.</li>
 	<li>Host a weekly or monthly photo contest using Instagram. The guest with the best photo wins a free meal, 10% of a service you offer, etc. It’s a great way to build positive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">social content</a> and promote your brand.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Gain Referrals &amp; Recommendations</h3>
Word of mouth referral is the best organic marketing tool out there and has quite a high conversion rate. However, it usually comes sporadically and doesn’t have a lasting or widespread impact. The next best things are online recommendations and referrals. Consider setting up business accounts with sites like <a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com/"">Trip Advisor</a>, Wanderfly, Yelp and Foursquare.

These services are free and will not only optimize your chances of being found online, but also give your audience a chance to leave feedback about their experience. Recommendation sites drive referral traffic and help your customer conversion rate climb. It also works as a great checks-and-balance system for you and your staff to uphold a high level regarding customer service and experience.

Don't care how I want it now!""

The above song may be a harmonious tantrum performed by one Veruca Salt in the 1971 film adaptation of <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,</i> but the lyrics speak to the way a hotel should perceive its guests. That’s not to say that all guests are sniveling, snotty-nosed adolescents, but for an industry that deals in comfort and convenience, it doesn’t hurt to operate under that assumption. The average overnighter takes for granted the luxuries a hotel provides. So when something does go awry, no matter how miniscule, the concierge often takes an ear-licking.

Guests expect their stay to go off without a hitch. They don’t want to see an establishment’s seams, so to speak. So, <b>a hotel must present itself as competent, discreet and ahead of the curve</b>. There are numerous approaches that can be taken to this end. Here, we discuss four:
<h3>1. Street propaganda:</h3>
Guerrilla marketing, a low budget, avant-garde approach to self-promotion can be highly effective in portraying an out of the box, curatorial image to a potential client; it also falls into the discreet category. A good propaganda campaign should promote with clever subtlety. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida advertising agency</a> knows the value of this technique lies in its ties to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketing</a>. A really creative guerrilla strategy can take on a life of its own by inspiring observers to document their reactions through Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and countless other social media sites. The following link demonstrates several examples of unique street propaganda:

<a href=""http://www.boredpanda.com/cool-and-creative-street-ads/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://www.boredpanda.com/cool-and-creative-street-ads/</a>
<h3>2. Easy online accessibility:</h3>
Hotel’s must make their website accessible and up-to-date. The site should leave no question unanswered. A customer should be able to book a room, dinner reservation or spa appointment with the touch of a mouse. They should be able to speak to a hotel representative via online chat. Basically, a hotel’s website should act as an interactive reception desk. Daily updates and notices regarding not just the hotel, but also the surrounding area can be helpful as well. It pays to work with a good developer who is aware of the latest advents and limitations of the Internet.
<h3>3. Go green image:</h3>
Environmentally conscious business practices are key. More so than a hotel making sure it's operating with the tiniest footprint it can muster, it should also promote these efforts to its guests. If the restaurant in the hotel only uses organic, farm-to-table ingredients, this should be made known. If the lobby motif is made from recycled materials, shout it from the rooftops. After all, green is definitely the new black. Guests will respect any effort to that end.
<h3>4. Respond to online comments:</h3>
Yet another cheap and fruitful way to make a positive impression with an audience is to keep up with what that audience is saying. This is sort of a no brainer, but to be truly effective, don’t just keep track of sites like <a href=""http://tripadvisor.com"">Trip Advisor</a> or <a href=""https://www.travelocity.com/"">Travelocity</a>. Instead, reply to comments, be those comments good or bad, with useful information. If a past guest complained about an obstructed room view, apologize and offer them a room with a better view during their next stay. If another applauds the tuna tartar at your dining establishment, thank them kindly and tell them they’re a real mensch for saying so. This practice makes a hotel seem more human; less like a machine on autopilot.

"Instagram's ""Photos of You"" Feature and What it Means to Brands","Since it’s launch in October 2010, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/"">Instagram</a> hasn’t made many major changes to their original formula. However, a couple months ago Instagram introduced the “Photos of You” addition to their application that allows users to tag friends and brands in their photos. Like Facebook, these tagged pictures will then appear on the profile that was tagged.
<h3>So, how does the feature work?</h3>
Instagram has made “Photos of You” easy for Instagrammers to utilize. When uploading a photo, just click the “Add People” option directly below the caption. You then tap on the person in the photo you wish to tag and select or search for their name.

You’re also able to go back and add a person to a picture you have already shared by simply going back to the picture and clicking “Add People.” However unlike <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a>, you’re only able to tag photos that you’ve uploaded.

Instagram will notify you when someone adds a photo of you. Worried about an unattractive photo of yourself being uploaded to your profile? Similar to Facebook, you can adjust your settings so that you can review pictures before they’re put on your Instagram.

You used to only able to @mention people and brands. People mentioned weren’t able to keep track of pictures uploaded by others and photo browsers were unable to tell who was who in the pictures.
<h3>What does this mean for brands?</h3>
Many brands have begun to incorporate Instagram into their marketing efforts. With the “Photos of You” feature, users are not only able to add photos of people, but they’re also able to tag the profiles of brands in their posts.

This gives brands the chance to see how consumers are interacting and using their products in everyday life. Brands also will have the opportunity to build stronger connections and more personal relationships with fans and followers.

Time will only tell, but the ability to tag brands seems to be setting Instagram up for advertising features sometime in the near future.

Why Email Marketing Maintains Its Value & Why You Should Use It,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">Email marketing</a> is a very important aspect of almost any business’s growth. It’s how brands, both large and small, communicate sales, special events and interesting content in order to help the brand remain on the subscriber’s mind. Many companies require submission to their email lists in order to use their services.  And, it’s a simple equation: people are willing to give up their email and personal information to receive some utility, even if it means accidentally subscribing to an email list you might not have accepted otherwise.

Each day, I receive at least twenty emails from companies trying to offer me a product or service. Sometimes, I’ll even receive three or more emails from the same company. I had to unsubscribe from Spotify because it would email me each time one of my friends joined the social network! It’s easy for a marketer to want to shy away from this model… after all, who doesn’t despise the task of going through and deleting irrelevant emails on a daily basis?

But, the reality is that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> remains valuable because it works. As much as I’m complaining, I recently purchased a Groupon for discount personal training sessions. I saw it in my inbox, it looked like a good deal, the location was convenient, and I was sold.

[quote] <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/a-rockin-legacy/"">Take a peek at how email marketing served a beneficial purpose for an Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children donorship event – thanks to BIGEYEs’ effective strategies!</a> [/quote]

How else would I have known about the sale? Perhaps Facebook or other social media? Unfortunately, it’s unlikely that I would have seen it there. Groupon’s hyper local model isn’t exactly conducive to allowing the company to tweet every single deal from its master account, and I’m only on Twitter a couple of times a day anyway, so I could easily miss the notice. Facebook is even worse… last year, Facebook announced that the <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/02/29/facebook-ads-explainer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">average Facebook post reaches only 16%</a> of fans.   Sponsored posts are supposed to take care of this problem, but only go so far in reaching intended <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience segments</a>. For one, if multiple brands are running sponsored posts targeting the same group, the individuals are bound to miss at least some of those postings.

Email marketing is a great way to ensure that your audience at least has the opportunity to receive your message. Unfortunately, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> presents some complications in and of its own. First of all, in an era of glut, how do you get people to sign up for your list? And, once they sign up, how to you ensure that they’ll actually open it and ultimately convert that person to a purchaser?

These questions are tough to tackle, and may require some advanced strategies to address. However, your company can invest in an email client that helps service some of your needs and provide analytical data as to open rates, click-throughs and conversions. This data can be invaluable in assessing what your potential customers need.

Why Great Website Design is Crucial to Your Business’ Success,"Meet Johnny. Johnny is a typical guy, and like most typical guys, he loves Chinese food. Johnny goes on Google to find a new place to order his favorite dish, Kung Pao chicken, and finds two Chinese restaurants with similar menus and prices. He clicks on the website for the first, and finds pixelated photos scanned in from the 1990s, alongside a nonfunctional design and numerous typos. He then clicks on the website for the second, and finds an easy to view menu, delectable photos of food that make his mouth water, and even an automated ordering feature. Which one do you think Johnny’s going to choose?

If Johnny doesn’t choose the second, then it’s because he’s nuts, and you probably shouldn’t take Johnny’s advice for anything, ever. Most people would choose the second, because a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">well-designed website</a> speaks to a business’s credibility, attention to detail and emphasis on creating a superior customer experience. Website one offers none of that, and while the restaurant may still stay in business, it’s losing substantial potential income and new customers based on its owner's refusal to put a few dollars into a rebranding and redesign of its website. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando advertising agency</a> can attest to the fact that companies that invest in engaging and interactive websites see a high return on investment relative to their competitors.

A website says a lot about a company. It’s an online residence, so to say, where you house everything you believe in about your company. And, like any residence, you can choose to live in a run-down shack, or you can choose to live in an ultra-modern smart home with sleek design and all the fixings. Of course, one might cost you a bit more–but the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a> promises you that more people are going to want to visit you at your state-of-the art residence than in a virtual shantytown.

[quote]<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/arsenal-venture-partners/"">BIGEYE redesigned Arsenal Venture Partners’ website to serve as an informative and interactive platform for consumers. Check out how their business benefited from the new website design!</a>[/quote]

This analogy goes far in explaining why functional website design is essential for the success of your business. It’s your online identity, and for many people who find your business through search engines, it’s their first introduction to your business. And you only have one chance to make a first impression.

If that’s not enough reason to reconsider your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">website design</a>, then also think about the role that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> plays. Search engines send “spiders” out into the Internet to track down new websites. These spiders electronically pick up on keywords and phrases to help direct people to sites like yours when they key in words such as Johnny’s search terms: “Best Chinese food Orlando.” Optimizing your website to focus on these words is a good first step, but the spiders also rely on algorithms that look at headings, page location, abuse of keywords and lots of other things in order to make sure that your site is a valid match. The algorithms are constantly in flux, but the best-designed sites hone in on the key drivers to help search engines find their sites.

"Everything You Need to Know About Paper, & Why It's Important","Whether you’re a designer working on an advertisement or a mother picking out your daughter’s birthday card, paper has a big impact on your choices. You may not know the types of paper, but you are influenced by the different types and textures. Fancy fonts, exciting graphics and catchy headlines tend to receive all of the attention in print projects, but paper selection is truly at the foundation.

Most people find paper selection to be a daunting task, but to Dori Hejtmanek, it’s a passion. Dori is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE's</a> Senior Graphic Designer, who after completing a Bachelor’s degree in graphic design, has worked in the business for over 15 years. Her experience with an array of large clients and demanding projects has made her a seasoned professional in the world of print.

Dori knows that paper choice can really make or break a project. The type, weight, finish, opacity and brightness affect all aspects of the printed piece. The same project printed on different types of paper can make a big difference in how it is perceived. Here, Dori tells us about her <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">background in print</a>, gives us advice, and shares her experiences with all things paper.
<h3>1. What type of print projects do you create most frequently?</h3>
Brochures! Throughout my career, brochures have always been the most common print project requested from clients. More recently, I’ve worked on a lot of stationary packages and annual reports.
<h3>2. What is your favorite type of paper to work with?</h3>
I really enjoy working with the <a href=""http://www.neenahpaper.com"">Neenah</a> brand of paper because of their wide selection and high quality. I love their variety of colors and textures.
<h3>3. Are there any natural pairings for paper and project types?</h3>
Yes! For example, cover stock is traditionally used for business cards, pocket folders and brochure covers. Light writing text is often used for stationary, and 100# text is used for brochures. Natural pairings are good guidelines to follow if you are just beginning to work with paper.
<h3>4. Do you consider paper during the design or production process?</h3>
I always consider paper before starting a project, so before both the design and production processes. The paper selection is part of the conceptual process, and sometimes the paper choice <i>is</i> the concept. I also print samples when deciding between various versions of the project in the production process.
<h3>5. Are there any rules you follow when selecting the type of paper?</h3>
I always have a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">discovery meeting</a> with clients to discuss their business objective and to get a feel for the type of project they are looking for. I also always ask a person’s budget. The worst thing would be designing a project around an expensive paper only to find out that it doesn’t fit the budget.
<h3>6. What advice do you give people starting out in print design?</h3>
Know your budget before conceptualizing. Also, there are tricks to achieve a certain look without spending a fortune. If a particular type of paper is too expensive, there are print techniques you can use to give projects a similar look. Finally, research printers and printing companies to find one that best meets the capabilities of the project.
<h3>7. As the world continues to go digital, have you seen a decline in print?</h3>
Yes, I’ve noticed a steady decline in the demand for print projects, but I don’t think that paper will ever disappear. There will always be a need for print production and tangible pieces in advertising, business and daily life.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we always consider paper before starting the design of our projects. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact us</a> today and let us guide your paper selection process!",,9/4/2013 9:27,23,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Everything-you-need-to-know-about-paper.jpg,everything-you-need-to-know-about-paper,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

Sports Marketers Take Social Media Interaction To the Next Level,"As tennis fans rush to the doors of the beautiful Louis Armstrong Stadium, set in the backdrop of Flushing, Queens, to see history made at the US Open, tourists and spectators quickly find themselves mesmerized by the humongous US Open Social Wall. The 50-by-8 foot wall is a collage of images, tweets and updates containing a plethora of online commentary around the big event.

It’s no secret that sports enthusiasts comprise a strong segment of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>. Just think about how many Facebook posts we see in our feeds each time the Bucs score a touchdown. But many times, sports marketers find themselves scratching their heads: they’ve done Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest. “What else is there to do?” clients ask <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>. Well, our team of experts is hereto serve up some pretty invaluable solutions!

The digital team behind the US Open found a way to leverage social engagement to create a stunning digital footprint that comprises an integrated picture of the big event. As documented by Instagram’s photojournalists, Twitter’s commentators and Facebook’s check-ins and status updates, it’s not just one person’s version of the events any longer-it’s now the story as told by everyone, anywhere in the world, on one sprawling wall.

Years ago, sports marketers realized they would need to leverage social media outlets to help <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">raise brand awareness</a> and encourage customer engagement. What started with simple accounts led to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">major social media-based campaigns</a>. However, in today’s data-driven sports marketing, simply registering a Twitter account isn’t enough. While that’s an important piece of the puzzle, it is important now for brands to find even more ways to innovate through interactivity and social sharing.

Take, for example, Nike, which not only encourages its fans to purchase its products, but has also created a community in which purchasers can align themselves with the brand on multiple fronts. Fans are able to monitor weight loss, challenge themselves to beat their athletic goals and interact with other members of their community, all through a distinct network created and maintained by a single brand. Nike even went so far as to build products for its users and fans, such as the Nike Fuel band, which helps people monitor their daily athletic activities and allows them to compete with friends. Ultimately, this brings Nike’s users closer to one another through technology.

By making social media a main attraction, the US Open Social Wall not only encourages people to engage with the content, but also provides a beacon for coverage concerning the day’s activities.[quote]Social media interaction isn’t limited to celebrities and sports personalities.[/quote] The Social Wall encourages people around the globe to share their thoughts, emotions and support for the players they love. And, it doesn’t hurt that the event’s big corporate sponsors are also raising awareness of their services.

While something as spectacular as the US Open Social Wall may not be feasible for every sports marketer, the takeaway is that such marketers can be inspired by watching how bigger companies <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">use social media</a> for their own campaigns. With that, marketers can then find ways to innovate within their own boundaries.

Maintaining Perspective When Marketing Beer to Women,"Beer companies get a bad rap when it comes to marketing beer to women. A recent <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3003728/carlsberg-taps-next-big-beer-market-really-women"">article</a> that appeared on Fast Company noted that 75% of beer purchases are by men. The article also went on to note that historically, beer companies have had trouble reaching females when it comes to marketing. These companies miss the mark by trying to sell these women by creating and selling sugary drinks that aren’t exactly in line with women’s tastes, which, according to the data, is primarily geared to wine.

So, what can these beer distributors do to get women on board with their brands and potentially double their revenue? There seem to be a number of strategies that companies can use to increase revenue through female purchasers – and they don’t taste like cough syrup in a bottle.

[quote]Product innovations may be key.[/quote]Just because women typically don’t like the harsh tastes of beer doesn’t mean that beer marketers need to create drinks that taste more like candy than beer. In fact, some of the more successful beer drinks marketed toward women are part of an expensive line of lambics from <a href=""https://www.lindemans.com/"">Lindeman’s</a>. These fruit-flavored beers have a slight sweetness, but are heavier and bolder than a malt-based wine cooler.

But, for companies that lack the budgets to produce beers directed at women, there is still hope. While years ago beer drinking may have been uncommon by women, today is another story.

Women currently make up 25% of the beer market, yet many beer ads and marketing promotions are directed toward men. These marketing spots often come across as testosterone-fueled, showing scantily clad women alongside the men who are trying to win them over.

If the classic idea that men don’t understand what women want is true at all, then perhaps it is time for beer companies to take note of this and get a woman’s perspective. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">Focus groups</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">qualitative data</a> and data collected from surveys and social media can give you insight into what the masses are thinking.

And, speaking of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, women are extremely active on platforms such as <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/"">Pinterest</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/?stype=lo&amp;jlou=AfdCP1vmFxyC_R8r5-inF00pOJhQUb29wJaJbzNQI25ZYSkjvRpNVtC5alTendCwEXYO5nVUkJdl1xDhMEAc_XOs&amp;smuh=36243&amp;lh=Ac86NoyZ8Fbnbmxe"">Facebook</a>. Developing a Pinterest strategy for your beer company can help your marketing team reach women where they live on the internet – the internet pin board is 97% female, and numerous companies that have run Pinterest campaigns have shown significant success.

As with all marketing, it is important to have a strong product. But, with marketing, it’s how you sell it that’s key. Each time I go to the bar, I see women drinking beer alongside their boyfriends or the other men in the group. Beer is also generally cheaper. It may be higher in calories, but brands like Budweiser have learned to reach women by creating a beer that is lower in calories than a traditional beer.

If your goal is to try reach women consumers, do what most successful companies do – make sure you have a superior product, and sell it accordingly. And, if your bubblegum flavored hot pink malt liquor drink isn’t a huge success like you’d hoped, talk to our <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Orlando advertising agency</a> about how we can help you create a better beer marketing strategy to reach women.

How to Sell Out a College Football Game Like A Pro,"On September 7, bitter football rivals University of Miami and University of Florida kicked off to a stadium full of screaming fans. Some people wait all year for football season (including the staff at our Florida advertising agency) – fanatics dress up in their favorite teams’ colors and enter stadiums full of pride, shooting down any social plans that might interfere with a big game.

This year, when UM and UF played, they did so in front of a packed house of nearly 77,000 fans, which was the Hurricanes’ largest crowd since 2004. <a href=""http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/sports/college-football/miami-sellout-for-florida-game-bucks-a-national-/nZmmN/"">According to The Palm Beach Post</a>, one of the major reasons college football game attendance has been dropping off in recent years is the fact that it’s all about atmosphere. With today’s fancy gadgets, viewers can get the stadium atmosphere from just about anywhere. Better TVs and more access have made it easier to watch the game from any location.[quote]Plus, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> allows real-time feeds and engagement from anywhere with a cell signal or Wi-Fi.[/quote] Who wants to pay for the experience in person when they can just as easily watch it with up-to-the-minute commentary in front of their high-definition TVs and a dozen friends?

But, there’s something inherently fun about seeing a game in person, a ritual that gets lost in an era of high-tech digital tools. Sports marketers aiming to fill seats at college football games are looking for innovative ways to help fill seats as stadium attendance continues to decline.

For instance, UM’s “Game Pass” card for season ticket holders offers a loyalty program that keeps fans visiting throughout the season and rewards them for doing so. Thirty-five to forty percent of the stadium’s 30,000 season ticket base have opted into the program.

Other schools, like Georgia Tech, are putting their money into aggressive marketing techniques to help sell tickets. These schools have hired third-party sales businesses to help reach out to alumni and other interested parties to sell tickets to games. In years past, there was no reason to be pushy when it came to sports marketing, but in recent years as companies have seen a <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304795804579097223907738780"">sharp decline</a>, schools have needed to reevaluate the ways in which they can help sell out football games.

Others are investing in digital ticketing, marketing and fundraising products to help them manage ticket inventories. Working with entrepreneurs who come from sports marketing backgrounds, colleges are aiming to reach a new generation of people who may just need an extra push to make the trek to the stadium on game day.

Some colleges are combating declining ticket sales by altering the ticket price per opponent. For instance, at Notre Dame, big games price in at slightly more expensive than smaller ones, prompting deal-seekers to attend the more affordable games and leaving the bigger games for fanatics.

For many colleges, selling seats is an avenue to better sponsorships, more resources and ultimately, better programs. When viewed in this light, it becomes essential to ramp up efforts, not just to instill school pride, but to help raise the overall status of the school as well. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida advertising agency</a> realizes the importance of maintaining high sales during college football season, and we want to see our local colleges score touchdown after touchdown with their marketing efforts. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact </a>our team today - so we can help yours!",,9/24/2013 16:05,24,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The-Threat-of-an-Empty-Seat-How-to-Sell-Out-a-College-Football-Game.jpg,how-to-sell-out-a-college-football-game,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Know The Importance of Embracing Seasonal Marketing,"Each year as the crisp fall air starts to deepen into a winter chill, people across the country don their snow boots (or just boots for us Florida folks) and head out to Starbucks seeking the type of warmth that can only come from a seasonal <a href=""http://store.starbucks.com/starbucks-christmas-blend-whole-bean/000160420,default,pd.html"">Starbucks Christmas</a> blend. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> loves these tastes – even when it’s still a balmy 70 degrees outside!

Starbucks’ Christmas coffees are insanely popular, and fanatics often endeavor to collect and sample these flavors year after year. The national coffee chain, which does very little advertising through conventional media such as TV advertising or print, managed to build this community through word-of-mouth - plus clever tactics that get people buzzing from more than just the caffeine in their tasty beverages.

For example, in 2011, Starbucks released an augmented <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">reality mobile app</a> tailored specifically to the Starbucks Christmas coffee experience. The reality app encouraged users to interact with their Starbucks-branded Christmas goodies, and offered them unique images and interactive graphics upon viewing.

How has Starbucks been able to so cleverly tap into the consumer psyche, causing positive associations between seasons and products?

We all know that holidays drive sales. But that’s only part of it. The other part is the authenticity of a company’s marketing efforts. Efforts geared towards seasons reflect life experience; and therefore, the most successful seasonal marketing efforts are ones that connect with the consumer’s emotions.

Beer marketers have known this for years, often releasing summer ales and winter lagers, made up of differing compounds to help correspond with the season. [quote]Rather than focusing on a one-off seasonal event, seasonal marketing becomes part of the company’s overall strategy.[/quote]

Therefore, a company’s “holiday” plan becomes a 365-day endeavor, with the most successful companies plotting their holiday strategies months in advance. Any company can do this by initiating a seasonal marketing calendar, and preparing for seasonal events months in advance.

For businesses that specialize in digital technology, it is easy to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">monitor website analytics</a> to learn more about consumer’s habits through the seasons. Retooling the year-long marketing plan to conform with consumer tastes and spending habits can help marketers identify trends and capitalize on consumer actions.

Companies that rely on seasonal marketing efforts can stretch their efforts further by finding ways to piggyback off of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">seasonal campaigns</a>. As discussed above, Starbucks keeps people coming back year after year with a line of limited edition items. However, other businesses can offer incentives for consumers to return after the holiday season, or can even start offering Valentine’s Day promotional materials just after the New Year.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida marketing agency</a> wants you to remember that the important thing about seasonal marketing is its appeal to customers’ emotions. In particular, the holiday season is a time when families make happy memories, and therefore changes in the weather evoke feelings of happiness and adoration. By tapping into these emotions and consumer behaviors, marketers are better able to connect with their purchasers.

So, the next time you walk into Starbucks and smell the fresh-ground dark roast coffee with a kick of cinnamon in the air, look around, and you’ll find yourself surrounded by seasonal marketing at its best. Let our team help your company embrace the seasons and take your marketing efforts to the next level - <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact us </a>today!",,9/30/2013 13:42,3,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fall-Flavors-and-Christmas-Tastes-How-to-Embrace-Seasonal-Marketing.jpg,the-importance-of-embracing-seasonal-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why Businesses Should Support Breast Cancer Awareness Month,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women with more than 220,00 women in the United States diagnosed each year. And every October, people around the world come together in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month to raise awareness of issues pertaining to breast cancer symptoms and treatment options.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando ad agency</a>, we’re constantly impressed with the marketing efforts we see that help build awareness of the breast cancer throughout the month. These efforts stretch far beyond 5k races and marches, and actively produce partnerships that result in additional funds for charitable causes, as well as increased sales for brands.

For instance, Mike’s Hard Lemonade, which produces sweetened malt beverages with the same alcohol content as beer, also sells a seasonal product called Mike’s Hard Pink Lemonade. The product’s pink packaging recognizes breast cancer awareness, in support of a Mike’s employee who lost the battle against breast cancer in 2009. Sales of the product support The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and the product continues to be a favorite of Mike’s customers to this day.

Sales of this product benefit the business in several ways. First of all, people may be attracted to this product over competitors’ due to its support of breast cancer research. In this instance, more sales not only means more money for charity, but also more money for Mike’s to continue supporting this initiative. Secondly, Mike’s demonstrated support of charitable causes builds goodwill within the community. Finally, the company’s act of recognition prompts emotional responses from breast cancer survivors and their loved ones, as well as people who may have lost family members and loved ones. These people in particular may then become lifelong Mike’s customers, even expanding to try other flavors upon recognizing the business’s commitment to breast cancer awareness.

Companies that are considering supporting breast cancer awareness should be wary of doing such just to garner a profit, as marketing efforts will not seem genuine and may possibly seem sleazy. Instead, these companies should focus on their commitment to social good as part of their overall mission statements, and should tailor marketing efforts to incorporate the act of supporting causes such as breast cancer awareness.

It’s all too common for <a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/news/etsy-pinkwashing-breast-cancer-awareness-month/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">businesses to engage in</a> “Pinkwashing,” which is the act of a business aligning itself with pink during October to boost sales, without actually supporting any breast cancer awareness initiatives. [quote]Fortunately, businesses that stick to ethical and genuine practices should not expect to receive such backlash.[/quote]

Supporting Breast Cancer Awareness Month is a great way to get your company to ""think pink"" and get involved with a worthwhile cause. Even simple acts such as running charity drives, selling promotional products to help support breast cancer survivors, and using products to raise awareness are great ways to align a business with a worthy cause while also promoting goodwill for the company.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> hopes you will consider these tips when planning your marketing efforts for October. Even just a few dollars in support of the cause can do great things.

How to Make a Comeback! Our Team's dos and don'ts,"Just a few months back, a rumor started circulating on the internet that ‘NSYNC would be joining forces to reunite for the first time in a decade. First, it was just a few murmurs, and then, as the buzz grew, fueled by a few leaks from publicity sources, the truth was out there for the world to witness: ‘NSYNC would indeed be joining Justin Timberlake at the 2013 VMAs.

While for some, this reunion may seem to have come from nowhere, it was actually a perfectly calculated stunt to help seed excitement for Justin Timberlake’s performance and garner publicity for the VMAs. And, Miley Cyrus’s twerk fiasco aside, the ‘NSYNC reunion was the biggest newsworthy piece of the entire event. In the age of Twitter, Facebook, Intagram and at-your-fingertips celebrity journalism, news of ‘NSYNC’s members getting together to perform at the VMAs spread like wildfire.

But time and again, other 90's bands and groups that reunite do so to little fanfare. Why is it that some comebacks are a raging success, while others mark a permanent fall from glory?

Here are a few tips that the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> has compiled to help you make a comeback that will have people’s tongues wagging for years to come:

<b>Have something worth a comeback:</b> There are certain things in this world that wouldn’t make it through a resurgence: Beanie Babies, Pogs and slap bracelets. But when 98 Degrees went on tour with Boyz II Men and New Kids on the Block, it was a rousing success.[quote]People often find themselves emotionally attached to nostalgia, which is why comebacks that speak to a previous era can be extremely successful.[/quote]

<b>Offer something new:</b> It’s easy to forget the days when Apple was dominated by its number one competitor, Microsoft. But when Apple took inventory of peoples’ complaints and created computers that alleviated the pains of owning a PC, they also created something that would revolutionize the way people used their computers. Offering something new and unique is a great way for businesses to stage a comeback when products are getting stale.

<b>Make necessary changes:</b> Is your product or image in need of an overhaul? It’s important to be able to keep up with the times, and make any necessary changes to your product’s image. After a major scandal, Tiger Woods’s success in recent years can be attributed to the changes in his behavior.

<b>Create momentum:</b> By creating momentum for your comeback, you also create hope and excitement for your audience. It takes work, but by seeding information on Twitter, posting updates in real-time on Facebook and Instagram, and keeping the press notified of your comeback, businesses can generate and maintain momentum leading up to the event.

<b>Make it a big event:</b> When Paula Deen made her first public appearance since the racism scandal that captured the nation, she opted to do so in Texas, to massive fanfare. Good publicists are masters of coming up with stunts that help guarantee attention. Be it a massive goodwill initiative or an epic stage show, make sure your comeback offers a memorable experience for everyone who sees it.

<b>Follow up</b>: A comeback doesn’t end with the big showcase. By following up with your audience, businesses and brands can keep the attention of potential customers in an ADD society. Do this by offering follow-up coverage of the event during the weeks following the big comeback, and piggybacking this onto future campaigns.

Whether you’re Tiger Woods, Paula Deen or ‘NSYNC at the VMAs, a well-executed comeback can leave a lasting impression. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact</a> our Florida advertising agency to help stage your big comeback!",,10/16/2013 9:53,24,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/How-to-Make-a-Comeback.jpg,how-to-make-a-comeback,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
What You Need to Know for Marketing the 180th Oktoberfest,"This year, masses of people will head to Munich, Germany, to participate in <a href=""http://www.oktoberfest.de/en/"">Oktoberfest</a>, a weeks-long party celebrating the best in beer, bratwurst and family entertainment. Throughout its course, the event attracts about 7 million people, all of whom want to be a piece of one of the largest celebrations in Europe.

The event, which is now in its 180<sup>th</sup> year, attracts both locals and tourists from around the world. With its massive beer tents, people gather in the streets to celebrate the festivities alongside one another.

While events inspired by Oktoberfest may fizzle out after even just a few years, the thrill of Oktoberfest hasn’t slowed down in the slightest in the last eighteen decades. Marketers continue to promote it as a piece of German tradition, tied with fun and festivities for all. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida ad agency</a> thinks marketers have plenty to learn from Oktoberfest’s promotions masters - after all, marketing the 180th Oktoberfest should be simple, right? Not without sufficient preparation, of course.

Oktoberfest starts with planning. Down to the last detail, planners coordinate the events months in advance to prepare people for the celebration. It’s with a deep understanding of the target consumer that Oktoberfest’s producers begin to plan the festivities. Through decades of practical knowledge, they’ve grown to understand their target demographic inside and out, are therefore able to effectively market to them.

How do their marketers and promoters do this? Oktoberfest producers are masters at selling the experience. Nowhere else in the world can you find Oktoberfest’s festivities in one place. With a history of toasting, drinking and tradition, the Oktoberfest producers have a unique product that they can sell to the masses. Additionally, because the festivities only come around for a few weeks during the year, there’s also the aura of exclusivity, eliciting the impression that it’s a limited time event worth making the expedition to Germany to witness.

Additionally, Oktoberfest shows us that people are willing to pay a premium for perceived value.[quote]A liter of beer at Oktoberfest may taste exactly the same as a liter of beer at a local pub, but people are willing to pay extra to drink the liter alongside friends while partaking in the revelry.[/quote] The average price of an Oktoberfest pint has risen from $8.49 USD to $12.12 USD over the past decade, but Oktoberfest producers and attendees would argue that it’s well worth the higher price. The takeaway? When assessing your business’s own marketing efforts, carefully consider whether you’ve been optimizing your price per consumer. You might find that it is more expensive to retain a higher value customer, but that higher value customer spends significantly more money with your business.

Additionally, even though the event occurs only annually, its curators keep an active <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OktoberfestMunich"">Facebook</a> profile to keep potential attendees engaged throughout the year. The active profile also helps build up anticipation in the weeks prior to the event, and offers a recap of the events as they transpire. They may not have had Facebook at the first Oktoberfest, but the event’s curators are definitely making good use of it 180 years later.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a> thinks Oktoberfest is about more than just a frosty mug of beer. It’s about the experience of being part of an annual event, one that people flock to from around the world. With nearly two centuries of experience, the team behind Oktoberfest are masters of the art of marketing.

Learn The Importance of Sports Apps for Avid Fans,"Sports junkies are an interesting breed. They always have season tickets for their favorite football and baseballs teams, never miss a game, and even run fantasy leagues with the hope that their knowledge of sports statistics might somehow garner them a big prize. And, as the folks at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> know, these avid fans can be worth a goldmine to companies that target sports enthusiasts.

But these days, in order to compete for the sports junkie’s attention, it is important to constantly be able to provide up-to-the minute stats and information, along with the convenience of efficiency and ease of use.

Sports junkies latch on to the newest technologies, typically because downloading the newest app or checking out the newest service helps them keep track of their favorite teams. With people using mobile more than ever, sports organizations that have yet to invest in mobile technology are failing to see the benefits of converting the rabid sports fan into a rabid customer.

Most of the best-known sports apps are owned by major brands, such as ESPN <a href=""http://proxy.espn.go.com/mobile/products/products?id=6857590"">ScoreCenter</a>, MLB.com <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat/"">At Bat</a>, and Yahoo! Scoremobile. ESPN and Yahoo! offer their apps for free, while MLB.com comes at a premium, running up to $14.99 for the season. However, as far as MLB goes, people are willing to pay good money for that app, which offers a customizable interface for keeping up with favorite teams, as well as streaming video access for every single game throughout the year. For an avid baseball fan, the opportunity to see every game for one price is amazing. Viewers can’t even get that on cable television!

Free apps help sports fans keep up with scores on the go, and the best ones offer in-depth commentary and statistical information about players. Whereas once this information was only available to sports staticians, it is now open to every single sports buff, all with a single click.

[quote]Sports marketers who are hoping to reach their fan base in new ways may want to consider creating apps that provide some service to their most loyal sports fans.[/quote]There are numerous untapped opportunities in this space, so honing in on a niche group and offering a service that fills a need through an app is a great way for sports marketers to get involved with new marketing opportunities. Examples of sports apps that have had success in this space include parking apps for sports events, Fantasy Football apps and even apps that help its users improve their golf swings on the go.

Sports marketers who connect to consumers through apps not only have numerous opportunities to engage with their app users, but also have numerous more touch points and ways to collect information about their using habits. Sports junkies rely on apps when they’re on the go, and in this fast-paced digital era, they’ll be frequent users of apps that offer utility.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando ad agency</a> thinks that for sports marketing, useful apps are some of the best ways to score points with sports junkies. Let us help you create your own app today - <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact us</a> to get started!",,10/11/2013 14:16,20,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The-Importance-of-Apps-for-Sports-Junkies.jpg,the-importance-of-sports-apps-for-avid-fans,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Unlock The Power of Using Babies to Market Your Brand,"Babies are adorable! There’s nothing in the world as beautiful as a smiling newborn. For years, marketers have caught on to this, providing uplifting content that features babies in the forefront. One example is an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOdyt7RsqTU"">Evian campaign</a> that features babies on roller skates, dancing to “The Rapper’s Delight.” The video has over 18 million views on YouTube. Another example is the famous E*Trade baby commercials that we look forward to while watching the Superbowl every year.

But beyond just babies, the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> thinks the fanfare around using babies to market your brand offers opportunities to make emotional connections to their target consumers. By being able to identify with their users, marketers can target the emergence of celebrity baby stories, and can often leverage these no matter what their relationship to baby products.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Through Twitter and Facebook,</a> companies attach to celebrity baby stories that seem to fall in line with their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand stories</a> and brand visions. Motherhood and maternity-oriented businesses seem to be especially in line with welcoming newborns, though it seems that broader companies like Target and Wal-Mart could stand to benefit just the same.

When the royal baby was born merely months ago, Twitter was on fire with tweets from marketers around the globe. Pampers used the birth of Baby George to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">promote a video</a> under the pretense of the fact that every baby is a prince or princess, which it had obviously been waiting to push until the moment the Royal Baby arrived.

Marketers also catch on the tabloid celebrity baby fads. When Kim Kardashian and hotheaded celebrity Kanye West, recently gave birth to their daughter North West, marketers flocked to the notion that the baby could epitomize what it means to be a luxury baby brand. Additionally, there are rumors that Kim herself is planning to launch a clothing line for babies, attesting to the marketing power of celebrity status and the Kardashian family’s ability to capitalize on it.

[quote]The luxury baby market is expected to be a $10.4 billion industry in 2014, with strollers going for as much as $3,000 for an Aston Martin brand leather stroller.[/quote]

By latching on to uplifting baby stories, marketers can identify with the emotions behind the brand’s mission. In joining the conversation, these marketers prove they are in tune with things that are happening in the world, and that they are appreciative of the uplifting nature of a good celeb baby story.

Be it Alec Baldwin, Fergie or Simon Cowell, fans love and support stars on their mission to start or continue growing their families. By offering comforting tweets about celebrity babies, marketers can seize the opportunity to join the conversation, while also pushing their products incidentally.

Brand are solidified based on their relationships with potential customers, so encouraging chatter about celebrity babies and being early informers of such breaking news helps drive a brand’s social media.

The best thing about all this is that people aren’t going to stop having babies anytime soon, and as long as there are babies, there will be opportunities for people to love seeing them.

The Differing Appeals of the Healthcare Field in the Mom Market,"Once a marketer has addressed the proper mom segment for his product or service, it becomes time for him to create an approach that reaches out to her. Finding an appeal that works to address the target helps generate brand preference down the line.

Just as there are multiple methods for subdividing the moms market, there are multiple appeals that are effective within the moms market. These may be appeals rooted in emotions, practicality, humor, fantasy, adventure, or a number of other types of appeals that relate to the needs, wishes and desires of the mom.

Different industries will see success with different appeals. A heartfelt appeal may be of less value to a luxury goods manufacturer than an appeal that offers a notion of adventure or fantasy. Industry-specific appeals can help drive the audience’s imagination, thereby beginning the process of instilling brand preference. Below, we will examine the appeals of the healthcare field.

People need healthcare services throughout every stage of their lives. Therefore, healthcare organizations tend to be family-friendly, fostering an environment of care and support, much as the family unit does. This also leads to marketers to hone in marketing to moms within this sector by emphasizing a commitment to care and service.

However, because of costs, service quality, expertise and other factors, moms have innumerable choices when it comes to providing healthcare for themselves and their families. Healthcare marketers may wish to convert new customers and retain existing ones by marketing in a manner that speaks to either the mom’s rational side or her emotional side.
<h3><i>Rational Appeals</i></h3>
[quote]Reaching out to moms by addressing their rationality is a strong tactic for healthcare marketers.[/quote]A rational appeal is a grounded approach that backs up marketing information with data-specific information and expertise in order to help sway the mother into making the “best” choice for her family. For example, when a marketer notes that four out of five doctors recommend a product, this appeals to rationality – if the doctors agree that it is the best product, then certainly it’s good enough for a mother and her family unit.
<ul>
 	<li><i>Statistics. </i>Statistics are great ways to create a rational appeal. If studies show that your child will be 90% safer with a certain type of car seat, it is likely that a responsible mother is going to be willing to spend extra money to ensure her child’s safety.</li>
 	<li><i>Expertise. </i>Backing up claims with expertise is also a great tool that marketers in the healthcare field can use to create rational appeal. A product endorsement from a noted physician or health care organization can help increase sales, as people are inclined to respect the product as they respect the noted professionals. An endorsement or testimonial assures the viewer or reader that the marketed product is effective, safe and useful.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3><i>Emotional Appeals</i></h3>
[quote]Designed to reach the mother at a greater level, the emotional appeal should elicit a deep feeling in the mother.[/quote]By nature, mothers are protective and offer a safety net for their children, as a mother is expected to help keep her child away from harm and to foster an environment of education and care. Touching on aspects of the child’s life that may jeopardize those elements will prompt the mom to act in a certain manner, and brands can recreate these feelings to help appeal to the mom, particularly when it comes to healthcare marketing.
<ul>
 	<li><i>Fear. </i>No matter how brave we might seem, there are some things that we fear on a daily basis. In the world of healthcare marketing, these items may be as broad as increased risk of illness, or keeping a child away from injury. It may also involve continual monitoring of a child to ensure that he or she is in good health. Marketers can help warn of the potential dangers by using a tactic designed to instill fear into mothers, thereby causing them to take action. Demonstrating dangers and then providing solutions is a solid way for healthcare marketers to make sure that they are sending their messages loud and clear.</li>
 	<li><i>Comfort, Security and Safety. </i>On the other hand, a strategy that incorporates comfort, security and safety may also provide a powerful incentive for moms to invest resources into healthcare. A hospital that idealizes itself as a caring environment may appear to be better suited for a sick child than a competing hospital that does not offer a feeling of comfort.</li>

"Spooky Ways to Reach Your Customers, Hallow-tastic ideas","Halloween is doubtlessly the spookiest holiday of all. For some people it means candy corns and tasty treats, but for others it means creepy surprises and discoveries around every corner.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> team has been following some of the best ways to reach customers in unexpected ways, ways that seem mysterious and spooky for Internet users that are unfamiliar with the tricks of the digital marketing trade. In honor of the upcoming holiday, we encourage you to make the most of Halloween by exploring <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency’s</a> list of spooky ways to reach your customer.

<b>Site Retargeting:</b> Have you ever been on a website, only to find an ad for that same site while surfing a different website days later? That’s a direct result of site retargeting, which uses cookies to capture user data in order to direct advertisements to them at a later date. The benefit of retargeting is that it helps advertise your products or services directly to people who’ve already expressed interest in your site, presumably leading to a higher rate of conversion for every ad dollar spent.

<b>Facebook Ads:</b>  For years, companies have been hesitant to experiment with Facebook ads. However, many people do not know that such advertising can be relatively affordable, especially for companies that offer niche products or services. Facebook’s ad platform allows users to create different iterations of their ads, and allows them to compare Facebook advertising metrics for each ad run. These ads can also be geo-targeted, so that they only reach people who are logging on from specific locales. It’s frighteningly easy to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">increase awareness</a> and conversions with just a few dollars toward a Facebook ad.

<b>Google AdWords:</b>  Like Facebook ads, Google <a href=""http://www.google.com/adwords/?channel=ha&amp;sourceid=awo&amp;subid=us-en-ha-aw-bklphd0~66539927045&amp;gclid=CJ3Ptd2Nl8UCFYw8gQod5ZoAiA"">AdWords</a> are great ways to market directly to your target customer. AdWords searches allow advertisers to align their ads with popular search terms. It’s important for people who are budgeting their ad searches to purchase keywords that are not necessarily too popular, but words that still reap hits. Google has a variety of tools and analytics to allow users to effectively use its AdWords services.

<b>Promoted Tweets:</b>  <a href=""http://ads.twitter.com/"">Promoted tweets</a> are tweets that brands can purchase that directly target users’ interests based on who they follow and how they use Twitter. For companies that invest in promoted tweets, this can be a great way to get the word out about a new product or service. However, if the promoted tweet does not ultimately encourage interaction and engagement, Twitter will discontinue the use of the promoted tweet, which ends up saving money for the person who purchased the promoted tweet slot.

[quote]The amount of money companies spend on paid media continues to grow as businesses see value in reaching out to potential customers in new ways.[/quote]Through a mix of paid, owned and earned media, companies can develop strategies to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">create awareness</a> within niche audiences, and ultimately reap the benefits through increased conversions. The team at our Florida marketing agency hopes that when it comes to investing in spooky methods of creative advertising, businesses won’t be afraid, and will ditch the tricks for the treats.

The Best Way to Embrace the End of Daylight Saving Time,"Many regions of the world recognize Daylight Saving Time, or DST, which is designed to allow more time for us to perform tasks while the sun is out. In the years when electricity wasn’t so widespread and many jobs required day labor, an extra hour of sunlight meant more time to finish tough jobs. But did you know that customers are more likely to spend money when the sun is out? An extra hour of sunlight can have a major impact on sales.

“Springing forward” affords us an extra hour of daylight in the evening during the summer months. This means an extra hour to enjoy the sunset, to lay on the beach and for kids to play outside. It also means we’re more alert and on-the-go for an extra hour, leaving plenty of time to shop and take care of errands and tasks. [quote]Whether real or psychological, it’s true that we start to wind down as the sun comes down, save for the night owls and late night partiers.[/quote]

However, the time change reminds us that winter is right around the corner. In some areas of the country, it means residents are bracing for snowstorms and ice, whereas here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we’re just happy if we get to see the leaves change color.

Given our appreciation for all, we’ve learned to embrace the end of Daylight Saving Time. Here are a few tips that we hope will make it easier for you, too.

<b>Get some sunshine:</b> Sunshine breaks are great ways to keep your energy up even though the days are shorter and the nights are colder. Stepping outside 10-15 minutes a day can do wonders for your immune system, health and mood.

<b>Exercise:</b> Sunshine has a positive effect on mood, so shorter days means that these feeling may be depleted more quickly throughout the day. Since you can’t make the days longer, exercising in the morning can help get your energy levels up even when the stars are still in the sky above you.

<b>Eat Healthy:</b> Fall is the perfect time of year for apples, pumpkins, squashes and other delicious fruits and vegetables. Cooking with seasonal ingredients can help embrace the upcoming fall weather. Light, veggie-filled meals mean more energy, even when the sun is gone and the stars are out.

<b>Invest in Natural Lights:</b> For both yourself and your business, investing in natural lights can help keep your mood and energy up through the day. Light therapy lamps are an excellent tool for people who tend to get the blues as the year comes to an end.

Thinking about your health and wellness in the fall can help you embrace the end of good ol' DST, allowing you to make the most of it for you and your work. While Daylight Saving Time may have come to an end, but that doesn’t mean it has to be a downer. Our team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> hopes that you will use our tips to you advantage - and <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact us</a> to help you maximize your daytime efficiency in the workplace!",,11/5/2013 10:30,3,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/How-to-Embrace-the-End-of-Daylight-Saving.jpg,how-to-embrace-the-end-of-daylight-saving-time,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Learn to Beat the Competition: It's Agility in Action,"At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a>, we’re constantly taking strides to work efficiently and effectively. It’s easy to get bogged down in the details of day-to-day operations. However, in organizations across the country, managers are now looking to agile and lean tactics to help keep their businesses ahead of the competition. These managers understand that their businesses operate as a unity of moving parts, and as such they’ve taught their employees to move rapidly and outpace competitors through easy-to-execute maneuvers.

In an era of so many digital products, there are now new ways to practice agile tactics in order to help your business succeed. For example, I recently heard an anecdote about a person who works for large corporation. At that business, all tweets must be approved by a high-level marketing manager. While in theory this would make for higher-quality marketing, prevalent research shows this is typically not the case. Once a tweet has gone through the entire chain-of-command, Twitter topics may no longer be relevant. This results in inefficiency for both the high-level employees and the rest of the marketing department.[quote]As anyone with a Twitter account knows, posting dated information is a great way to lose followers.[/quote]

A simple solution here is to edit the Twitter process. By <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">designing a playbook</a>, the company could offer a listing of tweets pre-approved by management, as well as a listing of the tweets that should always be approved at a higher level. This simple practice could save hours all around, allowing the teams more time to work on other projects.

This is an example of an agile solution; a solution that reduces inefficient labor but still allows higher-level oversight of the day-to-day operations of the brand. Companies that don’t engage in this type of behavior are missing opportunities to connect with customers and add value to relationships with the brand’s fans and followers.

While most digital marketers think of agile tactics in terms of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a>, these types of practices can be spread across the board in terms of measures that businesses can take to be more responsive on a daily basis. For example, one medium-sized ad agency in Manhattan now engages in daily “standing meetings” at the beginning of the day, meetings in which each person in the organization announces what they’re working on, and where they can use help. This collaborative environment helps people work together in new ways, all based on a firm understanding of the need to be responsive and flexible in the agency environment.

Other agile tactics in marketing may include customer service initiatives, such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">introducing social media customer</a> service via Facebook and Twitter. More and more large companies are seeing success through effective communication via social media, which are often a preference for people tired of waiting on hold for hours and filing email complaints that go unanswered.

Like the best athletes, the best businesses are the ones that are powerful, but are also focused on keeping up. Companies that fail to embrace innovation risk futures such as those of <a href=""http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/how-polaroid-came-back-from-the-brink-of-extinction#__federated=1"">Polaroid</a> or Microsoft – futures where their entire business model depends on people failing to adopt new practices that help them thrive in the digital era.

What's Growth Hacking All About? And What You Should Know,"The Internet is cluttered. Here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we’re inundated each day with reasons to try new products and services, and as we all know, what’s hot one day might not be so popular a week from now. In marketing, the difficulty of creating enough personal touch points to gain a conversion is compounded by shortened attention spans, and an influx of outlets to reach people - some of which may not be so helpful in the long run.

Fortunately, digital marketing thought leaders have particular expertise in being able to reach people in new ways. One of the tried and true methods of reaching individuals is through a concept called growth hacking.

While ideas for what might be considered a “growth hack” are as disparate as the innovators who concoct these ideas, there are some fundamental foundations that owners of startup companies can use to help leverage growth for their businesses.

One of the most commonly cited examples of growth hacking in action comes from Hotmail.com. Several years ago, Hotmail was a leader in the email industry. But as it was rising, it faced a high barrier to entry in the marketing arena, taking on tough competition from the already-established America Online email programs.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">Hotmail’s marketing</a> team found no success with traditional channels. This was also in an era before social media, making easy sharing impossible. Instead, Hotmail investor Tim Draper came up with a simple hack. At the bottom of his email, he would put an automatic email signature, one that said, quite simply, “P.S. I love you. Get your free email at Hotmail.""

This way, the message would get out to every person emailed from a Hotmail account. If any people switched to Hotmail email, the same signature would automatically be placed on their emails as well. In an era before the term “viral” existed in digital marketing, this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing strategy</a> went viral, leading to success for Hotmail for a number of years. (Read the <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/18/ps-i-love-you-get-your-free-email-at-hotmail/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">whole story</a> over at TechCrunch.)

These days, there are a number of other methods people use to encourage growth for their businesses.<a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> AirBNB</a>, a favorite company of tech enthusiasts, relies on good design as part of the overall strategy in order to keep consumers returning for more. However, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-harvested-craigslist-to-grow-its-listings-says-competitor-2011-5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">as Business Insider reports</a>, in its initial phases, it relied on growth by posting to none other than <a href=""http://craigslist.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Craigslist</a>, an internet classified ad system that itself began as a barebones startup that spread to many cities throughout the country.

People interested in learning more about growth hacking can join the community to learn more about trends in the industry by signing up at <a href=""http://www.growhack.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GrowHack</a>. In addition, Skillshare and <a href=""https://generalassemb.ly/online/videos/growth-hacking"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">General Assembly</a> offer courses on growth hacking.

Growth hacking can require significant experimentation, but luckily this type of trial-and-error methodology often has few costs and can lead to significant benefits.[quote]Companies that haven’t tried growth hacking should look for ways to shortcut growth in their businesses.[/quote] Outside-the-box thinking fosters innovation, and this innovation can help marketers figure out new ways to help grow their businesses, often on a shoestring budget.

The Seven Best Black Friday Marketing Practices You Should Know,"Black Friday is the biggest sales day of the year with a record $59 billion spent in 2012. Retail stores are seeing more and more people, lined up earlier and shopping later than ever. There’s just something about a nice Thanksgiving dinner that makes people comfortable spending cash on their loved ones (and themselves!) the day after.

Marketers who work for retail companies can expect sales upticks on Black Friday, but what can they do to make the most of it? Here, the marketers (and shopaholics) at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> share the 7 best Black Friday marketing tips for your company:

<b>1. Start Early, End Late:</b> Years ago, Black Friday was limited to just that. However, a <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/27/pf/black-friday/"">Black Friday summary</a> from CNN Money showed that 10% of Black Friday shoppers were at stores by 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving night, while 28% were there by midnight, showing that businesses can make even more profit with longer Black Friday hours.[quote]In the digital space, ecommerce companies also focus on Cyber Monday, which encourages deals for people who shop from their computers, tablets and mobile devices.[/quote]

<b>2. Look at Trends:</b> What sold well last year? What types of discounts helped the most? Looking at data form past promotions can help marketers tailor their sale strategies to consumer activities. Evaluating these trends also helps with the next item on our list…

<b>3. Set Goals:</b> For most companies, the Black Friday goal will always be to increase revenue. But perhaps the company also harbors secondary goals of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">increasing social media engagement</a> or pushing products that haven’t been selling as well. Looking at previous trends can help marketers set attainable goals, and can also help them tailor their strategies to insights regarding consumer behavior.

<b>4. Promote Where Your Potential Customers Are:</b> When determining where to place your ad dollars, try to assess your customers’ personas to figure out where you can most likely reach them. Internet savvy businesses may get more out of investing in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">social media campaigns</a>, while department stores with older clientele may have more success with advertising in print publications.

<b>5. Seek Publicity:</b> Each year, hundreds of media outlets report on Black Friday – not just the people lining up to be the first to snag a deal, but also months after the event to recap sales and trends. Businesses can seek to be part of this publicity storm by offering unusual deals, selling packages designed just for Black Friday and advertising unique offerings.

<b>6. Encourage Return Visits:</b> If one of your company’s goals is to increase sales between Black Friday and Christmas, it may be wise to offer coupons redeemable only after Black Friday. This can help incentivize people to return to the store and spend more money throughout the holiday season.

<b>7. Reward Employees:</b> Though more of a management tip, it is highly applicable to all business owners and CEOs who are running Black Friday campaigns. This time of year can be extraordinarily stressful, so incentivizing and rewarding hard work is one of the ways to help ease this stress for everyone.

Marketers who follow these tips can look forward to seeing success with their Black Friday campaigns. In the retail industry, it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate oneself, but with targeted marketing and advertising, the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> believes good marketing can turn Black Friday into lots and lots of green. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact us </a>today for more retail strategies to ensure you're prepared for a bevy of new customers!",,11/27/2013 11:41,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Back-to-Black-–-The-7-Best-Black-Friday-Practices-for-Marketers.jpg,the-7-best-black-friday-marketing-practices,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

Therefore, it allows marketers to implement testing strategies to help optimize their emails, and allows them to consider both the frequency of the emails and the content therein.
<h3>Alexa:</h3>
As a free tool, <a href=""http://www.alexa.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Alexa</a> helps marketers keep tabs on their competition. It helps marketers determine who their competitors are, and what those sites’ traffic and activity looks like. And, all it takes it knowledge of a competitors’ website; it helps determine global rank, rank within the U.S. and where people are finding the site. This can help marketers figure out what working--and what’s not.
<h3>SocialMention:</h3>
<a href=""http://socialmention.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SocialMention</a> easily allows people to conduct social listening, allowing them to pull from a multitude of sources to figure out what people are saying about a given product or trend. Using just a keyword, it can help users learn what people are saying about the given keyword, pulling from sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and Ask Jeeves.
<h3>BrandWatch:</h3>
SocialMention is a great tool for figuring out what people are saying about a given keyword, but <a href=""http://www.brandwatch.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">BrandWatch</a> is a great tool for learning how social media users are talking about brands. While there may be some overlap between the two services, BrandWatch is much more involved, offering visual interpretations of data and helping brands figure out larger patterns.

Without these types of tools, our jobs as marketers would be much more difficult and far less efficient. The team at our Florida ad agency gives thanks for these uber-helpful marketing tools, all of which continually help us produce the best marketing strategies for brands of any size.

Do You Know How the best way to Advertise on Twitter?,"Fresh on the heels of an IPO, there’s plenty of speculation about the future value of Twitter and how it will sustain revenue over the next few years. Certainly, it’s been proven that Twitter is around to stay, with a sizable base of users who constantly check their feeds for more content. Plus, there’s significant buzz around the value of Twitter, given its decision to close off its API and keep tracking data internal.

Regardless of how investors feel about Twitter, there are real opportunities for businesses of all sizes to advertise on the social media platform. There are three different ways to advertise on Twitter: Promoted Hashtags, Promoted Accounts and Promoted Tweets.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida ad agency</a> thought it would be helpful to break down Twitter ads to figure out the best ways to help businesses lever Twitter marking for their businesses.
<h3>Promoted Trends</h3>
Promoted trends are the true moneymakers for Twitter. Companies can purchase a Twitter hashtag for 24 hours, starting at about $200,000, for the exclusive right to be featured prominently as a trending hashtag throughout the course of the day. Obviously, this requires a huge marketing budget, but large businesses that can afford a promoted trend can typically expect to see a massive return on investment. Sponsored hashtags appear in the trends section of the desktop site and have featured placement on Twitter mobile.

On a recent Tuesday, the evening’s promoted trend was <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/tuesdaynightfootball"">#TuesdayNightFootball</a>. The hashtag appeared in a sidebar for every person who used Twitter on his or her computer for that entire day. The success of that marketing effort wasn’t just massive Twitter appeal; much of it was in the fact that people were consistently using that hashtag in their own Tweets, creating a network of posts and retweets to help <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">create awareness</a> of Tuesday Night Football. It also became a cross-promotional effort, with TV viewers being encouraged to tweet with that hashtag and attracting new viewers to their televisions to watch Tuesday Night Football.

Companies who opt to go with this type of advertising often do so through agencies, and do it in order to promote events or product launches. Only one promoted hashtag will run at a given time, so it is given a premium spot at a premium rate.
<h3>Promoted Accounts</h3>
Business owners can promote their accounts for much cheaper than they can purchase promoted hashtags. A promoted account features the advertiser’s account prominently on the desktop under “Who to Follow,” and reach only people who fit a particular profile, as determined by the advertiser.

Promoted accounts works best for people looking to grow their user base over time by cultivating user engagement. These seem to be a longer-term strategy. Also, advertisers only pay for users who follow their accounts as a result of the promoted account.
<h3>Promoted Tweets</h3>
[quote]Most small business Twitter success stories come from promoted Tweets.[/quote]These are easy to implement and geotarget, or, small businesses can choose to relay such tweets to niche populations who are interested in specific subject matter (which is based on the accounts a person follows and tweet topics).  These are best to use to drive immediate traffic.

Recently, a friend of mine who had a recently published book decided to take a shot at Twitter advertising. Her efforts garnered more than 2,000 impressions and hundreds of new followers. And, this all cost her a mere $5. With careful planning, this tactic can be an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">effective strategy</a> for engaging with potential customers.

Increasingly, businesses are learning to leverage Twitter to help grow their user base and engage with them more. People who are not getting the results they want from simply tweeting may wish to investigate Twitter advertising as an additional source of awareness. Business owners who have yet to experiment with Twitter advertising can <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact</a> our Florida marketing agency for help with creating the perfect Twitter ad campaign.",,12/5/2013 12:14,3,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Do-you-know-how-to-advertise-on-Twitter-.jpg,do-you-know-how-to-advertise-on-twitter,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How You Can Better Understand the Customer Journey,"I’m always baffled when I learn about marketers who don’t have a full understanding of their customers’ behaviors. To me, the customer’s journey is the first place marketers should turn when trying to analyze ways they can improve their business. From a theoretical perspective, understanding the journey helps the marketer understand the business itself. Oftentimes, marketers who instinctively look to the customer journey don’t have a specific name for it; at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a>, we think clarifying why customer's take a certain journey is a huge step in growing a business.

Analyzing a customer journey offers an opportunity for marketers to learn about how awareness leads to a purchase or other action. Assessing the customer journey helps determine whether, for example, the client should spend more money on awareness efforts or should stick to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">optimizing a website</a>.

[quote]The customer journey first involves looking at where people get most of their information about a company’s products or services.[/quote]Years ago, marketers could create conversions after connecting with a customer approximately seven times, typically though print or television advertising. However, because of the rise of social media, these various touches don’t always create as much impact, and now marketers suggest that it requires between 20-30 touch points to gain a new customer.

In the digital space, social media steers these touch points, driving the first step in the customer journey: <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/""><b>awareness</b></a>. Be it paid or owned social media, this is often the first line of contact. However, it can also come from paid or organic search. Understanding where customers are finding out about your product or service helps target your advertising efforts to where you’re more likely to drive traffic to your website.

Next comes <b>consideration</b>. This is where it becomes important for a marketer to convince a person that a product or service is right for them. This requires having a strong understanding of your target demographic, complete with user personas. Having a firm understanding of your target customer can help guide all brand decisions, and the results of these decisions should be able to push people into the next phase of the customer journey: <b>intent</b>.

While <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">good UX</a> should always be a strong consideration when building a website or virtual shopping cart, it’s most important in the intent phase. Think of Amazon.com’s shopping cart feature. Sometimes, people who drop off at this point may have intent to purchase, but forget or drop off for some other reason. This is where strategies such as ad retargeting can be helpful, reminding the user of their intent to purchase.

Citing <a href=""http://amazon.com"">Amazon</a> again, think of “1-Click” ordering. A person can choose to purchase in a single click, making the user experience as flawless as possible… and giving people fewer chances to change their minds between the intent phase and the next phase: the <b>purchase</b>.

Finally, the customer will make a purchase, resulting in a sale for the business. However, this is not necessarily the end of the customer journey; some marketers link this back to <b>advocacy</b>, such as when a person writes a glowing product review or shares it with friends.

Understanding your customer’s journey can help marketers find ways to simplify the process by cutting out friction in the purchasing or conversion phases.

The Top Three Secrets to Succeeding at Social Media,"Business owners often don’t understand the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">importance of social media</a>. Yes, when teenagers are posting selfies on their Facebook pages, it’s easy to think that Facebook is for “the kids.” But here’s a reality check: More than a billion people are on Facebook and, unlike TV advertising, businesses can target them based on very specific aspects of their lives. Business owners should think of their brands’ social media as their own “channels,” in much the way that TV channels work: the more good, interesting content you put out there, the more likely people are to latch on to you, follow you and engage with you.

Of course, social media also means there’s much more room for glut – but it’s also a place for small businesses to defy the odds through clever marketing strategies. Here are some key takeaways for small business owners to help maximize their social media exposure.
<h3>1. Yes, You Need to Be on Social Media.</h3>
Regardless of a business’s size, being active on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media can only help your company</a>. If you think people aren’t interested about, say, commercial plumbing services in Reno, Nevada, you’re wrong: people tweet and post about nearly every topic imaginable. Plus, social media is a great opportunity to field customer service inquires.

Businesses that still aren’t sure about social can implement <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">testing strategies</a> to determine social success, but be forewarned: as the world becomes more and more digital, there will be more and more reasons to be on social media.
<h3>2. No, You Don’t Need to Be on Every Social Media Outlet.</h3>
[quote]A company that specializes in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> doesn’t necessarily need to be on Pinterest and Instagram, particularly if the business’s customers aren’t on Pinterest and Instagram.[/quote]Business owners have limited bandwidth, and with such an influx of social media outlets, no one expects a business owner to be on all of them. In fact, doing so could actually cause harm, because in trying to build communities on all of them, a business owner could essentially fail to cultivate a community on any of them. What’s the best way to deal with this? Select your small business’s first social media outlet carefully, and expand from there. Typically, companies will first look to Facebook or Twitter, and can expand once they’ve established a routine and a community on one of those sites.
<h3>3. You Might Want to Put a Few Bucks Into Social Advertising.</h3>
Companies that aren’t experimenting with social ads could see if a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social ad strategy</a> works for them. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/advertising"">Facebook ads</a> are hyper-targeted and can offer, for some businesses, a high return on investment for carefully crafted ads. The same goes for Twitter.

However, for some companies, Facebook ads may not make sense. For example, due to stiff competition, searches related to car insurance have a high premium on keywords. However, other outlets such as Reddit and Pinterest offer ads that may be a better fit for brands with competitive keywords.

Why Should You Use Mobile Advertising? One Word: RESULTS,"Recently, <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/08/the-rise-of-the-mobile-born/?ncid=fb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TechCrunch.com reported on</a> a new generation that will grow up with only digital technology. These days are quickly approaching, and while many people are terrified of what it means for socialization skills and handwritten letters, the reality is that someday, people may never even need these tools. It’s easy to imagine an Armageddon that wipes out technology as we know it, but then again, our society still hasn’t a clue how Egyptians erected the pyramids thousands of years ago. As such, it’ll be important to embrace this technology, and the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a> thinks your business should start today.

It’s more than the devices we see on a daily basis: the tablets, the smartphones, and the ultra-light computers.[quote]Many of the devices that will change society the way the iPhone did are still yet to be invented.[/quote] It’s possible that someday, there will be as many different forms are mobile advertising as there are devices, and that’s something that advertisers should take note of as they seek to reach their target users.

As people are becoming more mobile, so too are ways to reach mobile users through creative advertising methods. According to AdAge, this year, mobile ad spending will surge 75% from 2012, up to $8 billion, with Google taking away nearly half that. <a href=""http://pewinternet.org/Commentary/2012/February/Pew-Internet-Mobile.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Pew Internet</a> reports that, in May, 56% of American adults owned smart phones, and that number has likely grown even larger throughout the year. Compare this against the 61% of people who own laptop computers and 58% of people who own desktop computers. While these are still the leading platforms in American households, evidence shows this won’t be the case for long.

Why are people so intent on mobile advertising? Because they’re seeing results. <a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/11/07/mobile-advertising-wins/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mashable recently posted</a> an article about small business success stories for companies using mobile ads. According to the article, 17.6% of web traffic comes directly from mobile, though that number will certainly rise as more and more companies find ways to leverage mobile use for their businesses.

As the Mashable article reports, 60% of Twitter’s user base is mobile, which means that companies advertising through mobile tweets can see targeted and oftentimes instant results. Rock/Creek, a company profiled in the article, used Promoted Tweets to advertise a sale, increasing their following by 172% over the prior month, leading to a 40% increase in sales.

Other companies are seeing significant success through geotargeting through location apps like Foursquare. Foursquare’s boasts a user base of 40 million people, and nearly all of those are mobile users. One significant Foursquare case study is that of<a href=""http://business.foursquare.com/success-barcade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Barcade</a>, a relatively small chain of arcade-themed bars throughout the Northeast, notes that for every customer conversion that costs $1.71 for the bar, each person spends about $20. Additionally, unlike print advertising, interactive analytic data allows Barbade’s marketing team to track the customer’s journey from first encountering the Foursquare ad, to the actual conversion when the customer first checks in.

No doubt that the coming years will see more methods of mobile advertising. The team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a> dubs this the mobile millennium, and expects to see big changes on the horizon.

Six Ways You Should Revamp Your Personal Brand in 2014,"Here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE’s Florida ad agency</a>, we spend a lot of time working with brands to help them define their voice and vision. We strategize every day, with the goal of implementing ideas and technologies that help connect brands with their audiences. But as the year begins, we think it’s important to remind our readers that there’s one brand that also takes time to cultivate and grow: your personal brand.

As we resolve to improve ourselves in 2014, it will make sense for many of us to reevaluate our personal brand: the message we put out there in the world about ourselves. Every day, through each of our interactions, we tell stories of who we are as people, and through these interactions, our audiences – everyone from family members to casual acquaintances – decide how and why they should want to work with us.

Here are a few tips to help you revamp and grow your personal brand in 2014:
<h3>1. Do a Brand Brief – For Yourself</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> consistently develops brand briefs for our clients, but did you know that you can also use this idea to help brand yourself? Doing a brand brief for yourself helps you to think critically about your own vision and mission: who you are, what you represent and what that means as part of the bigger picture.
<h3>2. Get Social</h3>
People who aren’t using social media are at a distinct disadvantage behind competitors. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Social media offers an easy way to stay connected with people</a>, and to share content that friends, business associates and acquaintances may find interesting. People who don’t feel comfortable posting personal information online can use social media in a purely professional context. Those considering taking that route might start with LinkedIn, which also allows users to connect through networking groups and by sharing interesting content.
<h3>3. Create Cohesion Across Channels</h3>
This is a simple marketing idea that also applies to individuals.[quote]People recognize brands because they recognize the brand voice and imagery, be it logos or other elements of design.[/quote] By making sure your personal letterhead matches your email signature and Twitter handle, you’re effectively branding yourself across channels in much the way a big brand like Nike or Pepsi does on a continuous basis.
<h3>4. Keep In Contact</h3>
The major reason brands send <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">promotional emails</a> at regular intervals is because they are extremely effective in helping them to retain customers. Therefore, sending out a monthly email newsletter with updates about various projects may help keep your personal brand in the forefront of peoples’ minds. However, if the newsletter email route doesn’t seem to work for you, try instead setting aside time each week to send out personal emails to old friends and colleagues.
<h3>5. Make Time For Others</h3>
With only so much time in the day, it can be compelling to spend more time working and less time meeting in person for lunch or coffee. However, taking the time to meet with old colleagues and acquaintances is a great way to keep up the networking mojo – and consequently, to help <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">improve your brand</a>.
<h3>6. Improve Your Business Mind</h3>
Investing some time and money into career improvement is a great way to help strengthen your personal brand. Taking online or in-person courses through companies like <a href=""http://www.coursera.org/"">Coursera</a>, <a href=""http://www.skillshare.com"">Skillshare</a> and <a href=""http://generalassemb.ly"">General Assembly</a> is an excellent way to help improve your personal brand.

How Website Optimization Can Help Grow Your Business,"Remember the first days of the Internet, when it felt as though every single person had a Geocities page, full flashing graphics and crazy clip art-inspired interfaces? This was in an era when search engine technology was miniscule, which most of us now rely upon.

In this day and age, there are many more options for businesses to build impressive web pages. But all the features in the world won’t necessarily make for a better website: the key lies between optimized design and optimized content. The team at our Florida marketing agency is ready to break down ways for business owners to do both - here, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> brings you a few thoughts regarding web optimization, and how it can help grow your business:
<h3>Website optimization:</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">Designing a great website</a> requires a calculated mix of graphic design and user experience design. Most companies that have great graphic teams may be lacking in the UX department, meaning that even if a website looks beautiful, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to navigate.

One solution to this is to enact user <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">testing on your website</a>, both throughout the development process and periodically after the site launches.[quote]Google Analytics offers powerful tools to help track users’ behaviors once they reach a website.[/quote] A high bounce rate may mean that your Google AdWords strategies are misleading, or that your site takes too long to load. Business owners can also test website functionality by asking about user experience through survey data or even informal questioning. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/quantitative-research-services/"">Collecting qualitative and quantitative</a> data as to friction points can help business owners find ways to ease user concerns. Some small businesses note massive increases in conversion to sales after installing quick and easy fixes such as a call to action on the front page or seamless shopping cart functionality.

Business owners can also optimize their websites using tools like <a href=""http://optimizely.com"">Optimizely</a>, which helps facilitate A/B testing to see which website designs work best within a given user base. Additionally, data mined using<a href=""http://moz.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Moz</a> can help boost the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> ranking of your website through design optimization in accordance with Google’s search algorithm.
<h3>Content Optimization:</h3>
Even the most beautifully designed website isn’t going to gain search engine traction if the content isn’t optimized. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Website content optimization</a> doesn’t just depend on the actual text on a website, but also is contingent on metadata, tags and a whole host of other facets that content writers can read about at Moz.

The number one rule of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO website optimization</a> is to avoid tactics that seem slimy, such as linkbaiting practices and poor-quality, keyword heavy content. These will seriously damage SEO rankings, and it may take a long time for a domain name to recover after losing rankings due to bad practices.

Companies can also improve SEO rankings by blogging. Focusing on a few keywords and posting about relevant topics pertaining to that field can give companies even more opportunities to appear in organic search.

Site content is just the start of search engine optimization; Moz and a host of other companies offer packages to help optimize the backend of your website using a variety of tools and facets, many of which are updated frequently to reflect constantly-evolving search engine ranking algorithms.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Florida ad agency</a> hopes you can use these tools to help optimize your site to get more money for your dollar. While website optimization in some cases may be a large investment, it can have a major payoff when it comes to the bottom line.  For more information as to how your business can optimize its website, please <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact</a> BIGEYE’s Florida advertising agency.",,1/14/2014 10:15,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/How-Website-Optimization-Can-Help-Grow-Your-Business.jpg,how-website-optimization-can-help-grow-your-business,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why Your Brand Should Consider Using App Development,"It’s a new year, and people around the country are working hard to keep their resolutions. Be it trying to smile more, have more fun or save money for that big vacation, resolutions are typically admirable goals that, if reached, can grant more positivity and joy to a person’s life.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our advertising agency</a>, we think one of the most awesome things about living in a world of smartphones and digital technology is that there are tons of apps to help us reach our goals. These are apps that help us manage our budgets, our fitness goals and our work-life balance.

The great thing about the digital economy is that marketers are able to use app development to find creative ways to tap into these tools to help integrate digital products with their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">marketing strategies</a>. When brands pick up on a need for their audiences, they can effectively develop apps to help provide a service while also marketing their own brand.

Take, for instance, <a href=""https://www.mint.com"">Mint</a>, which is a great tool for helping budget and save. Because it is able to provide a useful service to users, it can also strengthen its brand by partnering with major banks to help provide recommendations and advertising. Anyone resolving to save money in 2014 can use Mint to help plan for the future, and can also get tips on personalized banking options and experiences.

Those who’ve resolved to lose weight this year can use help from a number of apps, but none is as highly regarded as the Nike Fuel Band app and it’s partner device. Nike, a company once known only for its shoes, spent significant time and money on research and development to become a lifestyle brand. In doing so, it created a device that acts as a pedometer that syncs with a smart phone app, allowing people to easily monitor their progress and share with friends. This innovative technology goes far beyond what a shoe company has to offer, but at the end of the day, more people working out also equals more shoes sold by Nike. Plus, that doesn’t include the massive amounts of data Nike is capturing about its users. This is why Nike will remain a leader in the athletics and fitness space for a long time.

Finally, there are numerous apps that help people with education. For instance, language companies like <a href=""http://www.rosettastone.com"">Rosetta Stone</a> compliment their foreign language programs with immersive apps. In doing so, they not only provide a service to their users, but are also accessible to beginners who might be interested in partaking in the full program at a later date, but for the moment simply need to learn where to find the bathroom.

Take a tip from our<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> brand marketing agency</a>: Marketers should look to this these inspirational ideas for app utility to figure out what kinds of apps might help their users and their audiences. Doing so not only acts as great marketing, but also helps provide a service to users. In turn, those new products can help the brand grow into something bigger than itself.

BIGEYE'S Technology Predictions for The New Year!,"The movies would’ve had us believe that 2014 would be a year of flying cars, hover boards and even USB implants in human beings! While society still hasn’t yet evolved to that level (and, in some cases, thank goodness!), there are a number of things we can look forward to in 2014. As big companies like Google, Apple and Samsung continue to develop interactive technology, we expect to see interesting developments in app development, wearable tech and transportation services.

And now, we present to you, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency’s</a> list of tech predictions for 2014.
<h3>Wearable Tech: Google Glass, Smart Watches and Fitness Tech</h3>
Your iPhone 5 is great, but 2014 holds even more promise in terms of creating technological ease of use, utility and efficiency. [quote]As more companies see promise in wearable tech, these companies are beginning to offer numerous options in terms of devices and applications.[/quote]

For instance, in 2013, Google introduced the Glass Explorer program, in which it offered Google Glass to a number of select participants. Glass has proven to offer tremendous opportunities as a way for people to capture their lives and to communicate with others, using head motions and a series of finger taps. Now, it’s up to leading development teams to begin creating apps for Google Glass, as well as other new technologies such as the Samsung <a href=""http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/wearable-tech"">SmartWatch</a>, which interact with users’ cell phones to offer alerts and important information.

Additionally, we will see more companies investing in fitness tech. When Nike introduced the Fuel Band several years ago, it began offering fitness-savvy individuals a new way to interact within the fitness community. As fitness technology gets better, so too will the ways in which people use it to help set up – and achieve – fitness goals.
<h3>New Retail Strategies: An iBeacon of Hope</h3>
It’s no surprise that brick and mortar stores are struggling to maintain presence in a time where people can have products delivered to their doorsteps in just days. Still, new innovations in retail have shown some success with the <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202880"">iBeacon</a>, which provides targeted advertising to smart phone users geolocation services.
<h3>Education Innovation</h3>
As grad school costs continue to soar, more people are opting to pursue alternatives to an expensive and sometimes impractical training program. That’s why online education programs have proven so successful, and why their popularity only continues to rise. For a fraction of the cost of a full MBA program, people can learn specific skills like coding, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">web design</a> and business strategies.
<h3>Ride Into the Future: Transportation Services</h3>
With car services like Uber taking the nation by storm, it’s likely that we’re going to see more companies capitalizing on transportation trends. Last year, Virgin introduced the first glass-bottom plane, while the past few years have seen self-driving cars at Google’s campus, technology that will likely spread into the mainstream in the near future – possibly as soon as 2014.

May 2014 be full of excitement, joy and innovation! <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact</a> our team of experts today to determine how we may assist you in jumpstarting your marketing strategy in the new year!",,1/21/2014 9:49,25,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bigeye-Tech_Predictions_for_2014.jpg,bigeyes-tech-predictions-for-2014,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
4 Tips for Understanding Social Media Marketing ROI,"It’s not easy to determine a dollar-for-dollar return on investment for social media. The good news, though, is that a company needn’t find itself buried in this task: there are numerous ways to track whether social media marketing ROI investments are paying off in big ways.

Recently, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">marketing consultant</a> told me how when she first came on board with a new client, a large corporation, the CEO told her repeatedly that they should cut their social media because he couldn’t see a return on investment. So, she suggested they run a test that involved taking social media away for a period of a few weeks. Perhaps surprisingly, sales dropped throughout the course of the test.[quote]Circumstantial evidence led the marketers to deduce that the social media activities were, in fact, driving at least some sales.[/quote]

Luckily, brands are coming up with more effective ways to measure social media ROI. It begins with looking at analytic data, and using that to determine how that relates to financial data. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our Orlando ad agency</a> has a few tips that may help you in determining social media ROI for your business.
<h3>Tip One: Think Carefully About What You’re Measuring</h3>
It’s nearly impossible to measure direct sales from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media engagement</a>, just because someone saw or “favorited” your company’s tweet, it doesn’t necessarily mean that alone is what drove them to a conversion.

However, most sites have built-in analytic dashboards that allow their users to see which links are leading to hits for your site. (If you aren’t already collecting data through <a href=""http://www.google.com/analytics/ce/mws/?utm_expid=71218119-7.lBgmrTO8R3uEDwsxNxa_Nw.1"">Google Analytics</a>, sign up for a free account today). If you have evidence that someone clicked through an ad and landed on your site, it’s effectively telling that you that it was good for that, and if they’re not converting, there may be some other reason for it.
<h3> Tip Two: Think About the Quality of the Interaction Itself</h3>
It’s great when someone retweets your post, but it also makes a difference if the person sharing your content has one follower, or one million. In this way, companies can think more about the reach of a certain post than simply about the interaction itself. People with many followers often act as influencers not only online but in the real world, so <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media managers</a> can tap into influencer activities by having continuous conversations with these fans. Influencers can help companies build sales over time, so look at the investment the company is putting into engaging with fans and monitor whether sales increase over time.
<h3>Tip Three: Consider the Benefits of Social Media Beyond Marketing</h3>
While <a href=""http://twitter.com"">Twitter</a> is a great place for people to share their thoughts and comment on things they find interesting, it’s also a great way for them to reach businesses directly through their social media accounts. Many people report that their problems are answered more quickly when tweeted than when they try to call on the phone, and as such marketers should be prepared accordingly. As such, take into account how much money your company is saving through using social media as a customer service alternative.
<h3>Tip Four: When You’re Not Seeing a Return, Reassess Your Strategy</h3>
When it seems to your marketing team that your social media isn’t offering a significant return on investment, it’s time to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">address your strategy</a>. If your company sells a product that’s visually appealing, like gourmet food or luxury clothing, make sure you’re posting images on Pinterest that click through directly to your site. If you’re an author trying to market a book, consider doing a live chat with your fans about subjects related to the book, which can be informative and interesting and, in some cases, can even become a trending topic on Twitter.

"How to Create Great, Shareable Content For Your Business","In today’s world, it’s fairly common to find marketing materials filled with boring ad copy, mundane graphics, and subpar information. Companies are obsessed with producing content, without much regard for what the content actually entails. Don’t go on Facebook and see what brands find passable for “content.” Creating great content (<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a>) takes time and may not be quite as cheap as curating content from other sites. However, original content can be great for your business, as content that is quite sharable and interesting can easily gain traction on social media.

[quote]Creating good copy isn’t so much of a science as it is an art.[/quote] While at its core, the best advertising might be subjective, there are certain things marketers and copywriters can do to make their copy and content objectively better.

So, how can your business craft <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">interesting content</a>, content that potentially may go viral? Here are some of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency’s</a> favorite tips for creating great, shareable content:
<h3>Tell a Story!</h3>
A story can be a great lead-in to a bigger and more valid point (think of the essays by <a href=""http://gladwell.typepad.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Malcom Gladwell</a>, for instance). A story can help create an emotional connection with the reader, and for many companies, a brand is only as good as its story. This isn’t necessarily limited to story in the literal sense… companies can tell brilliant stories using images and limited text, as this <a href=""http://www.shopify.com/blog/7589919-the-secret-behind-oreos-social-media-marketing#axzz2px43G0Gr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Oreo case study</a> shows.
<h3>Make It a List!</h3>
Why are there so many lists making rounds on the internet these days? Well, the primary reason is that the list format makes things easy for readers to digest. Lists are tremendously sharable, so often times the most shared items are lists of content paired with compelling visuals. When thinking of what kinds of lists might benefit your brand, think of new takes on topics that have already been covered, or think about throwing a topical bent into a funny premise.
<h3>Make It Pretty!</h3>
People are more emotionally attached to images than they are to text alone. If you have a great story idea, finding a compelling photo or creating a great infographic to go along with it can be an easy way to make your content even more sharable.

[quote] <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/a-rockin-legacy/"">BIGEYE created some rockin’ content for an Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children donorship event. Check it out!</a> [/quote]
<h3>Make it Funny!</h3>
Some of the most sharable content on the internet is humorous content. Humor is a great way to connect with audiences, and media companies such as <a href=""http://www.collegehumor.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">College Humor</a>, <a href=""http://www.funnyordie.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Funny Or Die</a>, <a href=""http://www.cracked.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Cracked</a> and <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Buzzfeed</a> have found numerous ways to tap into a culture that shares content they think is funny or interesting. Humorous or uplifting content is typically more widely shared than negative or controversial, though I’m sure you can think of plenty of exceptions.

Branding Strategy Tips That Make an Awesome Impression,"If you have any sort of introverted qualities, you probably understand that it can take quite a bit of work to muster up the courage and energy to take that first meeting or introduce yourself to someone new. According to the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a>, the first impression you make on a person is the first impression they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. So, if you want to make it anywhere in the business world, that first impression has to be a good one.

Luckily, I’ve learned to beat that introversion, and you can too. All it takes is a little bit of practice and as much confidence as you can muster, using a few of our recommended <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">branding strategy tips</a> that make an awesome impression:
<h3>Tip 1: Address Your Appearance</h3>
You might be the best tech entrepreneur in the world, but no one is going to know that if you don’t look the part. Get a haircut, trim that beard and wear your nicest jacket if you want to leave a strong impression. While there are exceptions to this rule (think of Mark Zuckerburg and his infamous hoodie), wait until you’re already at that level until you decide you can start dressing down. Looking like a million bucks will also help you feel like a million bucks, so don’t be afraid to splurge just a little in the name of good style.
<h3>Tip 2: Stand Up Straight</h3>
Years of sitting in front of a computer may have left you with an awkward slouch. Make a conscious effort to stand up straight. Doing this will not only make you look more confident, but will psychologically make you feel more confident as well. Along the same lines, be conscious of your actions and try to avoid fidgeting, as this comes across as anxious and excitable.
<h3>Tip 3: Get a Good Night’s Sleep</h3>
You ever have any of those days where you’re sitting in a meeting and you started dozing off because you’d been working until 2 a.m. the night before? In our culture, we’re taught to value hard work, but that doesn’t mean you can’t sleep and can expect to get through the day on coffee and M&amp;Ms. Getting a good night’s sleep will give you a clear head, which will keep you bright eyed for your important meeting with the person who might just hold the key to your future.
<h3>Tip 4: Smile and Make Eye Contact</h3>
Smiling is another one of those psychological tricks a person can pull to make himself or herself and those around him or her feel better.[quote]Even if you have to force it at first, the act of a smile can help trick the mind into establishing feeling of happiness.[/quote] Also, making eye contact establishes rapport, and excellent rapport is ultimately the key to leaving a great first impression.
<h3>Tip 5: To Leave a Lasting Impression, Always Follow Up</h3>
This is by far the easiest thing a person can do. You had a great meeting, so within less than 24-hours, make sure you’re still on the person’s radar by shooting a quick note to thank the person for their time. It’s as easy as pie, right? But you’d be surprised how many people neglect to take this vital step.

Email Marketing Strategies To Ensure Higher Open Rates,"Email can be a drag. You’ve seen it – the constant emails from businesses begging for your money, offering not-so-great “deals” and “limited time offers,” emails that you immediately delete or leave as unread, depending on whether you’re super organized, or are a bit of an email hoarder, like me.

But wait… every once in a while, there’s that email from that brand you love: Nike, <a href=""http://www1.bloomingdales.com/index.ognc?cm_mmc=google-_-Brand+Terms+-+Main-_-Brand+Terms+-+Bloomingdale%27s-_-s_%2Bbloomingdales__36365056504&amp;mkwid=sqjaspt9B&amp;pcrid=36365056504&amp;keyword=%2Bbloomingdales&amp;matchtype=e&amp;gclid=CNDS1fqfwsUCFVYXHwodDR4AMg"">Bloomingdale’s</a>, or maybe<a href=""http://www.toms.com/?cid=ps_usbrand&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=toms&amp;utm_campaign=US+Brand+Head+Terms+-+Exact&amp;utm_content=sRhWiAt62_dc|pcrid|61794146095|pkw|toms|pmt|e|""> Tom’s</a>. It’s the one you always open, even if you know you’re not in the market for anything they’re offering anytime soon.[quote]You know once you open it, you’ll see something that inspires you, and reminds you why you love the brand in the first place.[/quote]

These awesome messages are rare, but guess what? You can make awesome <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">emails for your brand</a>, too! It’s part art and part science, but get the materials together, and the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> assures you that you too can entice fans to open your emails every time.
<h3>The Art &amp; Design Of It</h3>
You don’t have to be the Frank Lloyd Wright of email design to make a great-looking email. There are decent, customizable templates all over the internet, and for just a little more, you can hire people to make it for you. Once you have the template set, you can (and should) use that as a resource for all your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> for quite a while, so don’t be afraid to put a few bucks to get the real deal, as opposed to the a cheesy knockoff.

But it’s not just making a beautiful email that pops out toward the reader – it’s also about making sure it has a great voice, and that the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">voice matches your brand</a>. Are you a quirky company? Then why not include a silly fact or joke on your list? More serious? Then be sure to use elegant language and great imagery.

Also, in your email blasts, there’s no room for typos. Get a second opinion before you try to connect with your thousands of loyal patrons.

<h3>The Science Of It</h3>
Okay, so it looks great, it’s well-written and there are no glaring issues that might make it seem unprofessional. But, you’re still not seeing results. What gives?

Well, unfortunately, good visual design isn’t enough. Even though your email might look stunning, there are also unfortunately a few user experience cues to take in order to design the perfect email for your brand.

The best way to test user experience is to get feedback. Not from your friends and family, because they’ll always want to tell you how great you are, but from – you guessed it – the people who will actually be reading your emails. Send them a survey using <a href=""http://www.surveymonkey.com"">Survey Monkey</a> or any one of the other dozens of survey programs out there.

You can also do A/B testing to test the effectiveness of things like subject lines, the wording of your call to action, and photo placement. When testing, think of the scientific method: Question, research, hypothesis, test, analyze and share your results. Following this method will give you great data sets that you can put into action on future emails.
<h3>The Result: Best Email Marketing Ever!</h3>
The reality is, you don’t have to rely on terrible puns and silly cat photos to help sell your product through email marketing. Try these tips from our Florida marketing agency to create clear and effective emails, and watch as your emails become the only ones that don’t directly to the archive.

Resort Marketing Tips That Turn Small Budgets Into Big Results,"In the hospitality business, it’s sometimes necessary to slash budgets, and unfortunately, sometimes the people who suffer that the most are the people in the marketing department. Hotel and resort managers may be hesitant to invest money in projects unless they can see a clear return on investment, which is sometimes not easy to prove in the world of marketing, and in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media marketing</a> in particular.

However, companies that are struggling with small marketing budgets should look at this as a competitive advantage. At the outset, it seems counterintuitive: with large budgets, shouldn’t the businesses be able to spend more money to get the things they need?

Smaller budgets push hospitality marketers to work more creatively. It allows them to focus more closely on one facet of marketing that is often overlooked by larger corporations: the people.

That’s right. Sometimes, hotel chains or mega resorts become so big that it seems as though they somehow forget about the community that got them there in the first place. By thinking small and using it as an advantage, these smaller businesses are able to facilitate more direct relationships with their customers, something that larger businesses try unsuccessfully to do all the time.

For tourism and resort marketers and others in the hospitality industry, here are a few tips from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida ad agency</a> that will help guide your resort marketing efforts, even if you’re working on a shoestring budget.
<h3>1. Be Genuine</h3>
There’s something humbling about receiving an email from a mom and pop, independently owned businesses that take pride in offering visitors impeccable service. People in these types of businesses are there because they want to be there; unlike at some major chains where people are simply there because they need the job.[quote]By putting the emphasis on the relationship with the customer, the smaller shop has an advantage in that it can tailor its service to the needs of the individual.[/quote]
<h3>2. Use Social Media as a Way to Engage the Community</h3>
When dealing in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">social media</a>, the only budgetary restriction is time. But, the platform itself is free, and by investing in a good social media manager, a company can reap the rewards of someone who is skilled at interacting with people, who is also a customer service master and a pro brand advocate.

Since some of the best marketers a brand can have are influencers within an engaged community, allocating some investment in social media can help the company grow its <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media presence</a>, thereby helping it stay connected to its audience. For resort marketers, this is especially valid, as your audience may be comprised of people from all over the world.
<h3>3. Show That You’re Reliable and Trustworthy</h3>
Another advantage that smaller resorts have over big chains is that they have a more intimate connection to their customers. Who hasn’t tried to contact a large hotel chain and ended up feeling like more of a robot than a human being? Resorts that offer a hands-on approach to marketing and customer service can prove they have their customers’ best interests at heart. And, at its core, real resort marketing is about being authentic, and going above and beyond customers’ expectations.
<h3>4. Keep It Simple</h3>
So, you don’t have it in your budget to run a big TV ad takeover or a massive billboard campaign. That doesn’t matter, because working with a smaller budget allows resort marketers to tailor their marketing efforts to the people who are most likely to offer a return on that investment. Rather than trying to copy the pros, try instead to simplify marketing efforts to see how members of the community react. Chances are, they will appreciate the attention to detail that goes into these types of marketing efforts, and will reward your business by thinking of your resort first when it comes to making travel plans.

In these days of high-tech services and constant distraction, sometimes people just want to make a connection with another human being. People are hungry for this social connection that seems to be lost in the digital age. For large businesses, that connection can seem impossible, but for smaller resorts, it seems like a natural way to allow employees and staff to be truly authentic in their communication and marketing efforts.

7 resort marketing tips to help your bookings skyrocket,"In the era of the internet, it’s easy for the most amazing resort experiences to get lost in the endless stream of advertising and digital content. With so many resort options, resort marketers who truly want to break through the noise have a variety of tools in their arsenal to help them make the most of their advertising dollars by helping them recruit the customers — often times customers who become repeat visitors, coming back again and again, year after year.

Here are seven resort advertising tips – courtesy of your friends at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> – to help your bookings skyrocket.
<h3><b>1. Invest in search engine optimization</b></h3>
In a highly competitive space like the resort industry, it is important to ensure people can actually find your business in the midst of all the other websites out there. In this industry in particular, tailoring your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">website’s content</a> to make sure your site appears in organic search is a great way to attract attention to your site.
<h3><b>2. Experiment with Google AdWords and Facebook advertising</b></h3>
AdWords is a great way to give your business an extra boost in terms of search. Marketers can set their own rates and can also bid on keywords. By using such a service, marketers can experiment with images, call to actions and landing pages when testing on Google <a href=""https://www.google.com/adwords/"">AdWords</a>. This type of advertising can sometimes takes a little experimentation to get it just right, but, if it makes sense for your business to try it, AdWords users often experience excellent results.

Similarly, Facebook Ads allows users to select keywords and set rates for their campaigns. Facebook also offers hyper-targeted approaches, offering ads targeted directly at users based on their interests (i.e., travel, leisure) and location.
<h3><b>3. Optimize your webpage</b></h3>
If you’re still working with the website someone designed for you in 1996, chances are your page isn’t optimized for the web. In terms of optimization, there are numerous approaches. One is to design the site for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> purposes, so that it <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">appears highly-ranked in organic web searches</a>, but sometimes this isn’t the most visually-pleasing approach, and may result in high bounce rates. Therefore, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">experimenting and testing items</a> such as the placement of a call to action, the page aesthetic, and placement of keywords and phrases can help you nail down what works best for your site visitors.

Also, be sure to optimize your site for mobile and tablet experiences using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">responsive design</a>. In doing so, you can create an easy-to-use site that looks good no matter what platform.
<h3><b>4. Collect email addresses, front and center on your homepage</b></h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">Email marketing</a> is here to stay, mainly because people who use it see results. They’ve found they’re able to reach their users directly in their inboxes, which is a great way to keep users up to date about deals and happenings at the resort. Implementing an easy email collection box is a great way to increase the number of people who see your email blasts.
<h3><b>5. Optimize your emails</b></h3>
Optimizing your email experience will improve the number of people who click through the email to the site. Even factors such as the subject line and the time of day they <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">receive the email</a> can have a major effect on whether people take the time to look at them. Then, once they do open the email, what do they see? If the content isn’t optimized for mobile and tablet devices, users could decide not to view the email if it takes too long to load or looks garbled.
<h3><b>6. Invest in customer service</b></h3>
In the digital age, customer service and marketing are inextricably linked. A happy customer is the best marketing tool your resort can have, as that customer is likely to share their experience with their friends or on social information sites like <a href=""http://yelp.com/"">Yelp</a> and <a href=""http://tripadvisor.com/"">TripAdvisor</a>. Make it easy for the user to provide feedback and to talk to a real person when they have questions or suggestions for improvement.
<h3><b>7. Try ad retargeting</b></h3>
Once a person does visit your page, they may be interested initially but could get distracted from the ultimate goal of purchase as they move on to other items. A relatively new technology called retargeting uses the viewer’s browsing habits to store information, allowing brands to position their ads in front of the user at a later date on a completely different website. The idea is that the person may be inspired at that later time to purchase the good or service they’d only thought about before. Resorts can capitalize on this, as it often takes people some time to decide they want to book a vacation, and retargeting can help put the experience right in front of them, over and over again.

Taken together, these resort marketing factors can ensure more visitors come to your site and spend more time there, which will inevitably result in more bookings. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> thinks that resort marketers that are already taking these steps to improve the booking experience are at a distinct advantage, as is reflected in higher booking numbers.

Hyper Targeted Advertising in a Spike Jonze World,"Recently, I had a chance to see <em>Her</em>, the Spike Jonze-directed film about a man who falls in love with a human-like operating system. It is a wonderful film, and certainly is deserving of its place as an Academy Award-nominated film this awards season.

However, plot details aside, watching the film led me to think about about marketing and advertising in a new way, and to consider whether the current landscape push towards trends such as personalization and geolocation is actually a good thing. How do we address hyper targeted advertising in a Spike Jonze world - of sorts.

These days, companies are striving to give us each personalized experiences on our cell phones, tablets and laptop computers. Every day, more and more services spring up, trying to give you insights into the world around you. Many of these businesses purport to clear the noise by offering personalized recommendations as to where to eat breakfast, or which gym to join. But, often times all they do is cause more clutter.

The question that one might ask is, “Is hyper targeted advertising actually bad for us?” In the movie, it’s not clear - there are both plusses and minuses to such a hyper specific system that clearly understands the users thoughts, feelings and emotions. But, alas, that’s just a movie, written, shot and performed in a such a way as to help explore our deepest sense of what it means to be human. In the real world, it seems that the answers are much clearer.

For example, society hasn’t yet reached a place where artificial intelligence is a reality — just ask anyone from our Florida advertising agency who’s ever tried to get an answer from Siri and has been repeatedly given incorrect results, sometimes to the point of absurdity. We’re a long way from living in a world where machines can fulfill our deepest emotional needs. Rather, it is the content therein that often fulfills us.

For example, reading your favorite blog encourages you to be more proactive about your health or your career. When you’re bored, services like <a href=""http://www.meetup.com"">Meetup</a> and Eventbrite can inspire a person to take action, to partake in the events going on in the world around them.[quote]Even looking at pictures of food on a friend’s Instagram account can inspire a feeling of positivity and comfort.[/quote]

In a lot of ways, the hyper-targeting based on our personal wants and needs seems to be helping us fulfill those internal desires to connect with others. And, with the added convenience of being able to do these things on the fly, one can make a strong argument that our constant connectivity brings us closer together. Of course, that’s sometimes harder to believe when an acquaintance spends a full five minutes browsing the internet while you’re out to dinner together.

Still, it seems to me and the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando ad agency</a> that being able to receive personalized recommendations based on your location, age, gender, preferences and a host of other factors seems to be the best way to receive and digest information. Until we reach the day where artificial intelligence can seriously impede our need to communicate socially as human beings, then I believe we can live in a world where our connectedness can continue to bring us closer together.

Three Personal Branding Tips To Inspire Your Branding,"It hits all of us at some point - the latent feeling that we’re missing something, lacking inspiration in the work that we’re doing. Maybe it’s because we spent all night up with our sick children, or it might be because we’re burned out on the day-to-day minutia of running a successful business. Even though these moments are unavoidable, there are numerous things people can do to help boost inspiration in moments when it might not seem so easy.

The ideas I’m about to share not only apply to finding inspiration in business, but also to finding inspiration in everyday life. The goal should be to put your mind at ease, because as you will learn, the most creative, logical solutions often come when we’re relaxed, at ease and inspired. If you’re feeling a bit bogged down in your work or life, follow these personal branding tips from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> to help add a bit of extra positivity and inspiration to your world.
<h3>1. Create a Mood Board</h3>
A mood board is your own personal art project, and it’s really easy to create one. I typically use corkboard, but some people may find that using tape and a piece of cardboard works better. Use this as a guide, and post only things that speak to you and inspire you. If you’re designing one for your business, use it to add images, textures and articles that speak to the brand you aspire your business to become. If you’re designing it for yourself, find things you love and add them to the mood board to help develop a sense of who you are as a person.[quote]There’s no right way to create a mood board — it’s all about how you feel in the moment.[/quote]

Creating a mood board can be cathartic, and going forward, it can offer you a moment of zen when hurrying through an otherwise busy world. Keep it by your desk, and look at it each time you find yourself drifting off. Simply adding an image of a beautiful sunset can remind you of your inspiration to work long hours so you can enjoy that upcoming vacation you’ve planned.
<h3>2. Explore Your Surroundings</h3>
You’ve probably heard this advice before, but it’s always worth repeating. By taking a stroll to explore your surroundings, ideally though a setting in which you are in touch with nature, you have time to clear your mind and focus on the present, a practice called mindfulness. Rather than thinking about that next deadline or project, instead take time to focus on your breathing and enjoy the aromas of the world around you. This type of relaxation can be a great way to stimulate creative thinking.
<h3>3. Have a Healthy Snack</h3>
If you haven’t been eating right, then you’re certain to crash at some point. [quote]This can lead to a lack of inspiration or, even worse, severe headaches or crankiness.[/quote] Rather than going for the candy bar, coffee or energy drink, instead try munching on nuts or fresh fruit. It’s all the good stuff with a lot less of the bad, which can help you feel better, have more energy, and help you sort out your thoughts as well. Try to make this a daily, lifelong habit, as people who eat and live healthy tend to be more relaxed, calm and focused, which can do wonders for your both your personal life and your business life.

Simple Marketing Tips and Tidbits You Need To Know,"As the saying goes, you learn something new every day. That’s especially true in marketing, where sometimes even the smallest steps can lead to the largest payoff.

The items below are simple marketing tidbits we’ve learned after endless trial and error, and that we’re passing along to you because we think you can benefit from our Florida marketing agency’s blood, sweat and tears.

1. Putting a site wide search box can offer you great insight as to what people are trying to find when they come to your site, as you can track these searches through Google Analytics. If you run a blog, capitalize on this by producing content in accordance with what you find.

2. Only <a href=""http://marketingland.com/survey-online-6-percent-smbs-mobile-sites-45-percent-dont-site-73937?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed-channel&amp;utm_content=mobile"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">9% of U.S. small and medium-sized businesses are optimized for mobile</a>. This is true even though 34% of Americans admit that their cell phones are the primary device they use for going online, and smartphones and tablets accounted for more than 15% of all ecommerce sales in 2013. That number also fails to take into account the large number of people who browsed ecommerce sites from their phones or tablets but waited until they were at a computer or retail location to make purchases. Some experts estimate failure to optimize for mobile may cost these businesses, on average, $40,000 to $60,000 per year.

3. There are dozens of tools to use to determine how well your site functions and to identify problem areas. Try keying your site domain name into <a href=""http://nibbler.silktide.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://nibbler.silktide.com/</a> to see how it stacks up.

4. Maintaining an active Google+ site makes it more likely that your brand page will stand out on search engines. <a href=""http://moz.com/blog/google-plus-correlations"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Moz reports</a> that a URL’s number of +1s is highly correlated with its ranking in search. While Google claims +1s aren’t directly tied to search rankings, each +1 creates a link back to the post, which increases a site’s number of inbound links. These inbound links are one of the factors search engine algorithms use to determine the credibility of a site.

5. According to Experian (<a href=""http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2013/07/email-marketing-stats.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">via Salesforce</a>), $44.25 is the ROI for every $1 spent on email marketing. Even in spite of this, <a href=""http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-email-mobile-list"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">only 11% of emails are optimized for mobile</a>. [quote]Many ecommerce sites don’t even collect emails.[/quote] To get the most out of collecting emails, implement a highly visible, yet non-intrusive email submission form front and center on your homepage.

6. More Facebook page likes doesn’t necessary mean better business for your company. What’s most important is the quality of the follower. Having lots of low-quality followers could actually be detrimental to your brand. Don’t believe it? <a href=""http://adage.com/article/the-media-guy/viral-video-deftly-slams-facebook-advertising-vehicle/291634/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Check out this article</a> and pay special attention to the video from Veritasim. We’ve actually seen significant success for some brands with Facebook Ads, so take the experiments with a grain of salt.

A Few Simple Steps for Effective Content Optimization,"What do you think of when I say “optimization?” I’m willing to bet most of you think in terms of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search engine optimization</a>, the art of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">getting your website</a> and web content into the highest placement on related search engine searches. That tricky thing called SEO is as much of an art as it is a science. Try to cheat, and you risk making your website completely invisible on search.

[quote]Optimization isn’t limited to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>.[/quote] In marketing, there are a variety of ways you can optimize your homepage, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> and app experience, under a cluster of what some people call conversion optimization. If you’re aren’t taking care to make sure you’ve implemented optimal design, then you might be making it more difficult than necessary for people to find your site, navigate your homepage and email marketing, and ultimately, convert. Below is an overview of each from the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a>, as well as some information as to what steps you can take to optimize your content.
<h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
I opted to start with content optimization or SEO when it comes to ""optimization"" because it tends to be the most familiar, and because it can be so helpful in driving customers to your site. Essentially, search engine indexing systems rely on a series of algorithms in order to make sure the most relevant content appears first when a person keys in a search term. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Content creators</a> can capitalize on this by figuring out a few relevant keywords and posting content that relates to those subjects. Unfortunately, the average blogger can’t possibly understand all the factors at play in good SEO. However, website tools such as those offered by Moz can help ensure the blog experience is optimized for search, even giving content creators an optimization score per post. These types of tools can be highly valuable in making your site searchable within the clutter.

Additionally, other areas for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search engine optimization</a> include site static content (such as the “about” page or the introductory copy on the homepage of the site) and page headlines. Look carefully at what search terms are most valuable to your brand. A shoe retailer may not be able to optimize on the word “shoes” against corporate giants like Nike and Adidas, but may have more success with something more specific, like “beach shoes” or “summer sandals.” The <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDoQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fadwords.google.com%2Fo%2FTargeting%2FExplorer%3F__c%3D1000000000%26__u%3D1000000000%26ideaRequestType%3DKEYWORD_IDEAS&amp;ei=i0L-UoDBKIP6oATevILwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFaL4W6x6-_B_y-rAiiEgOZ-kEF-A&amp;sig2=TlJxM7nRxiyTerJZXk9u6Q&amp;bvm=bv.61190604,d.cGU"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google Keyword AdWords Tool</a> is a great way to figure out search viability for specific keywords, and then structure your content as to feature those words.
<h3>Conversion Optimization</h3>
This type of optimization strives to improve the visitor’s experience, with the goal of ultimately leading to the most conversions.

Optimizing a website means making sure it’s designed responsively. It means making sure that people can understand the content whether viewing it on mobile, tablet or desktop.

It also means making sure that you page loads very quickly, that information on the page is easy to navigate, and that the code used to make the page is strong. It means making sure links work and that there are no broken links. People interested in knowing how their site adds up for website optimization purposes can use check use <a href=""http://optimize.ly"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">optimize.ly</a> to run tests.

It also means running tests to make sure the calls to action are clear, and for ecommerce sites, it means checking to make sure the checkout process is as seamless as possible.

Conversion optimization also applies to email marketing. Experimenting with email length, subject lines and email template design is a great way to improve the effectiveness of the email marketing, resulting in more conversions.

If you’re not optimizing, you’re missing out on serious opportunities to increase your conversion metrics.

Why Digital Video is Such a Good Idea for Your Brand,"Whenever I discuss <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production</a> with small and medium brands, I often hear a lot of reasons why it’s not a great idea. “It’s too expensive,” clients tell me. Or, I’ll hear, “What happens if it doesn’t go viral?”

Well, more often than not, video can be a great idea for your brand, and with all the digital video production equipment out there, it doesn’t have to be expensive. Of course, there’s going to be a difference in quality between a Superbowl Ad and a short Vine that you post on Twitter, but if you’re creative enough — and I’m sure you are — there are fun and interesting ways to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">create engaging video</a> content with just a laptop or cell phone camera and a good idea.

Of course, anytime you make a video, there’s the urge to hope it goes viral. Fortunately, even if it doesn’t, the video content can still do a lot of good for your brand.[quote]If you create videos that tell great stories about what you’re doing, to be seen only by your social media followers, you can instill goodwill in your most loyal brand advocates.[/quote] Many would argue that’s much more important than having your video seen by a thousand people in Europe who have no interest in purchasing your product or service. In any case, if vitality is your goal, you can enlist the help of companies like <a href=""http://www.unrulymedia.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Unruly Media</a> to help seed your content for viral sharing.

There are numerous other great reasons to create digital video content for your brand. Here are some of my favorites, from our Florida marketing agency to you.
<h3>1. People are visual beings</h3>
A visual image will attract more attention than text alone.
<h3>2. Google gives preference to video content</h3>
Notice when you do a Google search, you’ll often see a designated area for videos related to your search, even if you were only looking for a website or article. This is because Google gives preference to video content. Such content doesn’t have to necessarily be hosted on YouTube (which is owned by Google), though it helps.
<h3>3. Video sharing on Facebook outperforms other types of content in 5 out of 6 industries</h3>
<a href=""http://www.michaelleander.me/blog/video-sharing-on-facebook-outperforms-other-content-types-in-5-out-of-6-industries/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">In a study</a> of 42 brands over 7 consumer categories, video was the most commonly shared type of content for 34 of the brands.
<h3>4. Video sharing is becoming more popular as internet and mobile speeds increase around the world</h3>
These days, many people do not even own cable due to the abundance of content they can find online for free on YouTube channels, as well as sites like Hulu. Some YouTube channels have millions of subscribers, showing that people can build up a loyal following with their web-based video content.

How to Develop a Social Media Strategy for Your Personal Brand,"When most people log into Facebook, it’s not usually because they’re thinking about how to improve the strength of their personal brand. However, if you ask the best marketers at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, they’ll tell you that they’ve learned how to carefully curate a personal <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a> to reflect who they are.

It’s a fact that people who head large corporations often develop a large social media following, in spite of the fact that the personal brand and the company’s brand are not one in the same. People who’ve developed strong personal brands can become thought leaders, and can capitalize on that through valued connections, speaking engagements and strategic partnerships.

To become one of those people, think of your social media as a gateway to your own brand. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida ad agency</a> thinks you can get the most out of it by taking the following steps:
<h3>1. STAY TRUE TO YOUR VALUES.</h3>
It’s important for people who are developing their personal brand on social media to stay true to their values. If you desire to be known as a political junkie, don’t be afraid to use social media to pose difficult questions. If you’re more interested in cultivating an atmosphere of positivity, it makes much more sense to stay away from mean-spirited jokes or controversy. Whatever those values are, adhere to them closely as you build up your brand presence.
<h3>2. AIM FOR CONVERSATION.</h3>
Celebrities like Lady Gaga and Britney Spears are so popular on Twitter because of their constant interactions with fans. They encourage followers to tweet at them and share their experiences with them, which helps to cultivate relationships in a sometimes passive medium. While it may not be possible to respond to each and every post or comment, making an attempt to engage with and respond to your audience is a great way to build up rapport and credibility.
<h3>3. PROVIDE CONTENT ON A REGULAR BASIS.</h3>
If you have a background in branding, you’re probably familiar with <a href=""http://hootsuite.com"">HootSuite</a> and how to use it to schedule posts to keep content flow steady. [quote]Those who are not using HootSuite for their personal brands are at a distinct disadvantage.[/quote] Try using the platform to set up posts throughout the week, and see how much better your postings do when they’re scheduled rather than on the fly.
<h3>4. REPURPOSE CONTENT.</h3>
Does a topical event in the news relate to something you’ve posted about in the past? If that’s the case, it’s completely acceptable to repurpose it and share it again. Those who keep active blogs can also post tips from there <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">directly to social media</a>, which is a great way to keep the content flowing when there’s no time to research and post something new.
<h3>5. KEEP IT INTERESTING.</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Interesting content</a> — and lots of it — is the key to keeping followers interested on social media. While we can’t all be the Shakespeare of the internet, we can decide to post only content that truly resonates with us in some way, thereby avoiding cliches or “fluff.” The days of posting what you ate for breakfast should be gone, especially with so many interesting things happening in our daily lives and the compelling content being posted each day on the internet.

Top seven Tips to Stretch a Small Marketing Budget,"It’s been said that limitations are the key to creativity.

If you have millions of dollars to throw around with marketing, chances are, you’re going to end up spending a fair bit of it on things that don’t actually work...that’s precisely why small marketing budgets can be a blessing in disguise.

If you’re working at or own a business, but have only a limited marketing budget, have no fear, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida ad agency</a> is here to help you grow, one dollar at a time with the following seven tips:

<strong>1. Make a plan:</strong> A marketing budget, no matter how small, will go much further if you have a set of concrete goals to apply your funds. Even something as small as $500 will go a lot further if you have measurable goals in mind.

<strong>2. Know that your biggest investment is time:</strong> If you have time, you have a distinct advantage over businesses that have large marketing budgets but limited time to implement strategies. Allocate your time wisely, and apply it strategically to help get the most value for your dollar.

<strong>3. Look for growth hacking ideas:</strong> Growth hacking means finding small and inexpensive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">ways to seed awareness</a> of your product or service.

<strong>4. Start a company blog:</strong> This can help you establish credibility as a leader in your field, and can also be great in terms of search engine optimization. The more articles you post, the more ways potential clients or customers will be able to find your site.

<strong>5. Consider a handwritten note or gift:</strong> Even a small token of appreciation to your early customers can go a long way in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer marketing</a> and repeat purchasers. Include some stickers, and invite your customers to Instagram photos of where they’ve put them. Create a specific hashtag specifically for this purpose.

<strong>6. Create how-to videos:</strong> At this point, most people in the media business agree that people will forgive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">moderate video production</a> quality for grassroots and growing businesses as long as the content itself is good. No one is expecting a Stephen Spielberg-esque production; just set aside time to record some how-to videos pertaining to your product, service or field, and use that to leverage even more credibility and to increase your following on <a href=""http://youtube.com"">YouTube</a>.[quote]Repurpose the content by linking out to the videos on your social accounts as well.[/quote]

<strong>7. Send a newsletter:</strong> Weekly or monthly newsletters provide easy ways for businesses to grow their marketing base and get repeat customers. Provide interesting content in a visually appealing way. Once you have the template set, the biggest task is the time it takes to draft and send the email. If possible, experiment with subject lines, copy length and calls to action to determine what works best for you.

And for a bonus tip -- Make it easy for your customers to share their experiences! This includes making sure there are easy-to-find social share icons on your website, and simple templates for feedback and customer service. Remember that customer service and marketing aren’t as attenuated as once previously thought, as happy customers can serve as your brand’s biggest influencers.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a> encourages you to follow these tips to help grow your business, without breaking the bank.

7  Ways to Get Lucky on St. Patrick's Day INFOGRAPHIC,"<strong>7 Ways to Get Lucky on St. Patrick’s Day</strong>

By Rhett Withey Posted on March 13, 2014

<strong>1. Start the morning strong with Irish coffee </strong>

To prepare for the day or recover from the night, this is one way to wake up refreshed. Too much consumption may result in one believing in leprechauns.
<ul>
 	<li>1.5 oz of Jameson Irish Whiskey</li>
 	<li>1 oz of brown sugar syrup</li>
 	<li>Hot brewed coffee</li>
 	<li>Unsweetened cream</li>
 	<li>Lightly whip and enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<strong>2. Search for a four leaf clover</strong>

Legend says that each leaf of the clover means something: the first is for hope, the second for faith, the third for love and the fourth is for luck.

<strong>3. Wear green</strong>

The ancient Irish used to wear green to show their love for the harvest gods. Show that special someone how much you love them by wearing green. Clothing is definitely recommended with extra points for creativity.

Over 94 million people plan to wear green on St. Patrick’s Day!

<strong>4. Give thanks for your pot of gold</strong>

Say this Irish blessing: “May good luck be with you wherever you go, and your blessing outnumber the shamrocks that grow.”

<strong>5. Celebrate Irish heritage</strong>

Grab a pint and thank the Irish for creating this binge-drinking occasion that could bring you and your significant other together by fate, or Irish car bombs.

There are an estimated 34 million Americans with Irish ancestry.

<strong>6. Pucker up</strong>

Find a lucky pair of lips to lock with. They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone it will give you magical powers of persuasion. We recommend you find your own “Blarney Stone”, but we warn you that a combination of Guinness and thinking you have powers may result in a slap to the face. Proceed with caution on this one.

<strong>7. Move your feet</strong>

Get into the groove by learning an Irish folk dance or crank up some classics like U2. However we do not recommend that you try not to take too much of the spotlight - this may result in obnoxious and embarrassing posts via social media.",,3/13/2014 7:48,23,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SHARE-THIS-INFOGRAPHIC-–-7-Ways-to-Get-Lucky-on-St.-Patrick’s-Day.jpg,7-ways-to-get-lucky-on-st-patricks-day-infographic,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
3 Questions to Ask When Creating Brand Preference in Moms,"For marketers who are aimed at creating brand preference in moms, it is useful to take a look at the brand itself. You want to attract the right types of moms for the brand, as attracting the wrong type can lead to dilution of brand value. Look at what your brand has to offer the mom market, and then embellish those qualities that allow it to stand out amongst competitors by asking a few key questions:
<h3>1. Is our brand memorable?</h3>
Though the brand doesn’t necessarily need to be in a mom’s face at all times, she does need exposure to the brand and needs ways to be able to find it when needed. In this era, being able to find the brand means that she can find it in the store, using Google, on Amazon, or social media sites.[quote]The harder it is to instill the brand into one’s memory, the harder it will be for brands to generate loyalty in their targets.[/quote] In order to help make the brand memorable, it’s essential to go to the platforms where moms are sharing information with one another in order to leave a lasting impression.
<h3>2. Is our brand meaningful?</h3>
Whether it’s enjoying a meal together at <a href=""http://olivegarden.com"">Olive Garden</a> or walking through the mall in attention-getting <a href=""http://gucci.com"">Gucci</a> shades, the brands that have positive impacts on the target’s lives are the ones that will succeed in creating preference. Without meaning, there’s no difference between buying Huggies and buying store brand diapers; but many moms are more apt to go for the Huggies because of their variety of facets, such as age-appropriate diapers, that help ease the frustrations of changing diapers. Huggies have made a connection point not only in their marketing, but also in their appeal to make the lives of women easier.
<h3>3. Is our brand likable?</h3>
Brand marketers should work to ensure that their brands are in line with the desires of mothers. A brand with a tough edge can open up it’s market to the modern mom by softening up, portraying the brand as likeable and fun. The brand marketer should embellish the aspects of their products that make moms’ lives easier, more exciting and more fulfilled. A company that sells necessities for children can better reach moms by bundling items such as diapers and baby wipes. Also, with new developments in big data, it’s easy to monitor what your users are saying about your products on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and other social media outlets. Make sure that you are listening to the conversation, engaging your audience and taking quick action to resolving any problems that may arise.

The Relationship Between a Customer Service Strategy and Marketing,"Once upon a time, marketing and customer service were completely separate entities. Particularly in areas where there was slight competition, bad customer service didn’t matter because people had only limited options; for the most part, entities such as the post office and DMV still function like this.

However, as the world has become more global, it’s become clear that there are almost always other options. As such, the divide between marketing and customer service has blurred. If you don’t believe me, ask anyone whose brand has ever suffered a bombardment of complaints from unhappy users via social media. Such complaints and criticism is no longer limited to a one-on-one phone call — people all over the world can read these complaints in an instant, as long as they have access to the internet.

While some companies have always had an emphasis on customer service, others have taken for granted that they can actually lose customers in the long run if they have had terrible customer service experiences. Take, for example, Ryanair, a low-cost British airline that relied on being efficient, even if that meant being rude to paying customers. Late last year, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/20/ryanair-idUSL5N0HG1F020130920"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the company’s CEO admitted</a> that the brand was ready to take on a new strategy that involved being nicer to customers.

Because we live in an age where customer service complaints can spread like wildfire, it’s important to consider customer service as a marketing commodity. Some companies have built entire businesses around excellent customer service experiences, such as <a href=""http://zappos.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Zappos</a>, a company that integrates customer happiness into its overall brand strategy.

[quote]At the end of the day, a brand should be about its customer, and that shouldn’t end at the point of a sale.[/quote] Thinking of customer service in terms of marketing means developing an understanding that your customers are your biggest advocates, and that they are the ones who will be spreading the word about your business. When people <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">share a great brand experience on social media</a>, they are sharing that with all of the people around them. And remember, when it comes to sharing about brand experiences, people tend to only comment on really good or really bad - no one ever goes to their Twitter feed about an okay customer service experience.

Thinking about the evolving relationship between customer service and marketing means making sure your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media customer service strategy</a> isn’t just a canned response, offering someone a phone number. There’s a reason they took to Twitter; it’s possible they were bothered by long phone wait times or are simply in a place where it’s inconvenient to make a call. While different social media customer service strategies may work differently for individual brands, the strategies should always reflect an understanding that customers deserve to be treated like people, even if it means simply responding with care to a tweet or Facebook comment.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida ad agency</a> thinks understanding this relationship is a great way to go from happy customers to happy brand advocates.

5 Creative Ideas for Local Business Marketing and Advertising,"Your business is doing well, but you know it could be doing better. You’ve tried all kinds of things, but aren’t seeing the results you want. Well, the team here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando ad agency</a> wants to offer you five creative ideas to help you improve your local business marketing.
<h3>1. Sponsor a little league team</h3>
Many times, these teams will wear sports jerseys advertising the sponsor at all their games. All that advertising will expose your brand to their parents, which will not only help grow your business but will also make your business seem like a charitable leader within the community.
<h3>2. Get active on Yelp and Foursquare</h3>
So, you think you don’t need to be active on Yelp and Foursquare because your target audience isn’t using those services? You might be surprised. Often, when people conduct searches, Yelp is one of the first sites that comes up. And, as some business owners know, a difference in half of a star in a Yelp review can make or break a business. As for <a href=""https://foursquare.com"">Foursquare</a>, what better way to get repeat customers than to offer incentives for them sharing their experiences?[quote]Many people use the service to check-in to places, sharing their whereabouts with their network.[/quote] These people can share offer tips and mini-reviews for friends and strangers alike, so being active on Foursquare can actively bring more people to your business.
<h3>3. Introduce yourself to local business owners</h3>
Many times, small business merchants know one another. If you’re a coffee shop, wouldn’t it be great to have the monopoly on referrals from your friends at the barbershop down the block? This tends to work exceptionally well in neighborhoods that are mixed residential and business, as people who know each other can <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">create interesting networks of client relationships</a>.
<h3>4. Throw a party</h3>
Parties and events are great ways to get people in the door. Try pairing up with a local charity, and if possible, attempt to find donors for food and beverage. (However, if you are planning to serve food and beverage, make sure you comply with any local health and safety laws.)
<h3>5. Try a Groupon or LivingSocial deal</h3>
Groupons and LivingSocial deals tend to be most popular at a hyper local level. People purchase Groupons that they know they will use, and this tends to frequently be when the location of the business is relatively close to where the person lives. As such, if a business can structure a Groupon as to where they’re not taking a hit by running it, then it can be an extremely valuable marketing tool to help get people in the door. People often spend more than the value of the Groupon, and they may be likely to return after having a great experience.

These ideas can help bring business to your company, while also staying true to the value of a local, community-driven business.

Why Differentiation Is the Most Important Marketing Tactic,"Even as marketers, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a> knows we’re also consumers. Each day, we face hundreds of choices as to where to eat, where to shop, and which brand of soda to buy. Giving your money to one brand is, essentially, giving your support to that brand to keep doing what they’re doing. Particularly, in the case of a repeat purchase, you’re telling the brand you’re satisfied with the product and have returned to using it again.

But, what is it that drives you to that decision to support that brand? Often, it’s convenience, like when I’m on the road, starving, yet the only restaurant around is that McDonald’s just off the highway. However, typically people have more options. Instead of going to the Publix down the street, you could drive a bit further to <a href=""http://freshmarket.com"">Fresh Market</a>, where you know you’ll be welcomed by a team of happy people serving fee samples, and will have the opportunity to purchase healthier foods that you might not get from a competing store down the street.

Or, maybe you like Fresh Market, but you know you can get a much better deal from <a href=""https://www.winndixie.com/"">Winn Dixie</a> down the street. It may not be as fancy, but you know their deli meat prices are unbeatable. In this case, Winn Dixie can differentiate itself based on cost.

Many times, business owners and marketers fail to recognize the importance of differentiation. Differentiation is a key aspect of effectively marketing a business. It is what tells people why you’re superior to other businesses and competitors in the space. If you can’t beat other businesses based on cost, then perhaps you can beat them based on luxury, convenience or customer service.

[quote]Differentiation is the process of standing out in some way.[/quote]If there are a million others just like you, there’s not much to make you stand out. But, if there’s some way you can distinguish yourself from others, you can beat out competitors by being the best at whatever that is. It’s okay if your brand can’t beat others in every category… it’s a matter of finding the one that’s right for you, and committing to being the best within that space.

Take, for example, <a href=""http://shopethica.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethica</a>, a grassroots business dedicated to women’s apparel. If the business were limited to just that, they wouldn’t stand a chance against larger retailers that can make clothes cheaper using factory laborers. But, that’s just it. Ethica’s founders decided to adopt a social good initiative, allowing them to only carry clothing and accessories that they can verify is created ethically. Because of that, they’ve garnered attention from some of the leading fashion publications in the United States. Differentiation is key in the company’s success.

You can see many examples of differentiation in the choices you make every day. I tend to spend more money on my favorite brand of tissue, but I’ll forsake quality for price when it comes to kitchen needs, like plastic wrap or aluminum foil.Everyone has preferences, so for marketers it’s often just a matter of delving into those specific preferences.

When thinking about your business, ask yourself how you are differentiating your business. If you can’t think of anything, then start today by emphasizing your strengths, and working to design campaigns around those differentiators. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando ad agency</a> guarantees that focusing on differentiators will bring results. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact us </a>today to get started setting your company apart!",,4/1/2014 9:54,10,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Most-Important-Thing-to-Know-About-Marketing-Differentiation.jpg,why-differentiation-is-the-most-important-marketing-tactic,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How to Create an Effective Hospital Marketing Plan,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">Marketing plan development</a> is the most important step in executing a solid hospital marketing initiative. After receiving business objectives, the marketing team should create a plan to address the objectives. If the business objective is to increase market share by 2%, the marketing plan would include budget, initial measurement, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">research</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign strategy</a>, measureable campaign performance indicators, media schedule, creative strategy and projected outcomes.

Here are the elements of the plan in further detail:
<h3>Budget</h3>
[quote]In a landscape with limited resources, it is important to properly estimate the amount of funds to be designated to each project.[/quote] Underestimating the financial and resource cost may create problems or, in some cases, may jeopardize the initiative. When allocating resources, planners must remember to take into account aspects such as personnel, project costs, technological considerations (web hosting platforms, project management systems) and design and printing fees.
<h3>Performance Indicators</h3>
Choosing the correct performance indicators is contingent upon knowing what is important to the hospital or service line. If the goal is to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">increase awareness</a> of a new medical unit, increasing the hospital’s email list is not necessarily the best performance indicator; better metrics may include the number of new customers acquired, or data measured by patient questionnaires. Delineating these as part of the marketing plan will help hospitals keep relevant data sets, which can be useful in evaluating campaign success in future marketing efforts or in budgeting.
<h3>Media Schedule</h3>
A media schedule will help a company keep track of assets, project launch dates, costs and hours worked. The media schedule should be careful to take into consideration both digital and print media schedules, as well as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">social media pages</a> and the resources required to keep them up-to-date.

<h3>Creative Strategy</h3>
The creative strategy needn’t encompass every piece of creative work expected throughout the course of the year; rather, it should focus on only the baseline message, assets and resources. The creative strategy should help copywriters and art directors see the bigger picture of the marketing plan and can help the creative team adhere to these guidelines throughout the year.
<h3>Projected Outcomes</h3>
Predictions help solidify goals. If, for example, performance indicators show that the campaign is coming up short of desired outcomes, this offers leeway for the team to amend the project, conduct a post-mortem and to determine the cause of the shortcomings. Over time, a collection of data can help the team to stay on course to help ensure growth and stability within the hospital.

Social Media Listening and Social Media Marketing,"Marketers can garner a ton of data from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media listening</a> — some people would argue it’s even too much! It can be daunting to try to sift through the noise, but with a little bit of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">calculated research</a>, doing efficient social media listening can help marketers better understand brands, customers and the relationship between the two.

The biggest thing about social media listening is that it takes time. However, taking a few weeks to conduct a proper <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">social media brand analysis</a> is ultimately much cheaper than spending a significant amount of cash to conduct a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">focus group</a>. This type of social media research also takes money, granted you’re working with large brands and need to use powerful social media listening tools such as those from Sysomos and Radian6. But, if you don’t want to pay for such tools, there are a variety of methods to help learn about users and how they interact and engage with social media content. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> thinks you should try the following:

<strong>SET A GOAL</strong>

The most important and often overlooked aspect of social media listening is to determine a goal. “Get more Facebook likes” is not a goal; if that’s all you really wanted, there are plenty of places to buy them on the Internet. What would likely be a better goal for that brand would be to get more engagement, which for them would hopefully create more site traffic and ultimately more sales. The more specific this goal, the better the results of your social media listening survey will be.

<strong>RESEARCH THE BRAND</strong>

When conducting social media listening, a great place to start is by researching the brand through other sources. Checking Wikipedia, conducting informal research about the brand and closely reviewing the website helps understand the consistent viewpoints, and the dichotomy between the ways the brand describes itself, and what others say about the brand. If the brand has a brick-and-mortar location, visit it in person.

<strong>START WITH FACEBOOK</strong>

Then comes the fun part. Start by checking the brand’s Facebook page, and specifically, clicking on the box that says “likes,” which will take you to another page that will show you the brand’s activities in terms of mentions and new likes. It’ll also tell you which week was the brand’s most popular week, so you can look to that to see the kind of content that gets the best result. Also, if people are sharing photos and fan curated content, this might offer <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">some insight into the types of marketing promotions</a> you can run in the future.

<strong>CHECK TWITTER</strong>

Then, check Twitter to find out what types of things people are tweeting at the brand, and how the brand is responding. Take note of any patterns or canned responses for complaints, as this can be an area for improvement in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a>. Many times, brands are more active on Facebook, but have much stronger followings on Twitter, which can be a valuable insight in learning how to better leverage Twitter.

<strong>REVIEW OTHER SOCIAL CHANNELS</strong>

Finally, start looking to other social media networks: Instagram, Pinterest, tumblr, and anything else that might offer some insight into how people are interacting with the brand. In a recent review, I found that one of my clients had a significant Instagram following, yet did very little to engage with them. I also found that another brand had a massive and engaged following on Pinterest, yet was doing little to leverage this in terms of campaigns, and encouraged them to experiment with ways to grow their following.

<strong>CREATE A CAMPAIGN</strong>

Once you have the baseline information, the next step is to take behaviors you’re already seeing and to leverage them in order to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">create a campaign or strategy</a>. An active Instagram fan base might inspire a photo competition, while a heightened Pinterest strategy might lead to more of an interest in aspirational brand photography than previously used. But remember to keep your eyes set on the goal, as your strategy may differ if the goal is to increase site visitors than it would be to try to get more people to visit a stores’ physical location.

In any case, social media can be a valuable tool in helping you understand your brand.

How to Kiss Long Strategic Findings Documents Goodbye,"In doing the work that I do as a strategist, it can be difficult to take long and complex research sets and narrow them down into short, concise documents. I tend to think every little insight I discover is groundbreaking and should be carefully perused by everyone at every level at a company, but I’ve been doing this long enough to know that nearly no one wants to read a long document full of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">analytic data.</a> For some of these folks, looking at a long document full of important strategic findings is just about as interesting as reading your tax returns for the last ten years.

However, I’ve luckily found numerous ways to keep clients, as well as the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida ad agency</a>, satisfied through presenting data in a much clearer and more engaging manner. The goal is to rely on an often-used phrase, “Keep it simple, stupid!” I promise I’m not calling anyone stupid, it’s just a great way to remember to simplify in every aspect of business where possible — including writing research reports. Here are some of the tips I’ve employed to keep people interested in the content so my memos don’t have to keep competing with stacks of other boring documents.
<h3>Summarize</h3>
If you must write a long research report, offer a clear summary of findings on the first page of the report. For many people, and especially high-level executives, this will be the only part of the report they will actually read.
<h3>If it’s a Brief, Keep it Brief</h3>
There’s a reason they call it a brief, you know. Keeping it under two pages will make it more likely that people will read the entire thing, ensuring they won’t miss any important items.
<h3>Use Images</h3>
Almost any type of image will add more interest to a page of text. A chart or graph can make for an excellent storytelling device, and a photo can offer a visual description of the content or inspire ideation. If nothing else, take a quote from the report, add some white space around it and highlight it, making it stand out on the page.
<h3>Use Humor</h3>
This may not be appropriate in all circumstances, but where it is, use it to your advantage. In presenting material using humor, you are more likely to keep the reader interested in the content, plus funny lines or quips will help them better remember the material. Even inserting a funny image of a <a href=""http://www.lolcats.com"">LOLCat</a> can help make an otherwise stale collection of data into something more interesting, which will also make you look like a star when people can’t stop talking about it in the break room. [quote]Remember, your content doesn’t have to be boring and stale, and in fact, making it more interesting will help people to better remember the content.[/quote]

Unleashing the Power of LinkedIn for Business Development,"It’s no secret that <a href=""http://linkedin.com"">LinkedIn</a> is an incredibly valuable networking tool. However, like all social channels, LinkedIn isn’t simply about the number of connections. Business owners that know how to leverage LinkedIn can build it into their business development strategies, helping them to create strategic partnerships with people who have compelling experience or interesting skills to help grow the business.

Business owners who want to use LinkedIn for business development efforts may accomplish this in a variety of ways. LinkedIn offers areas for sponsored content, which means that if you can provide <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">interesting content</a> specific to your industry, you can use paid LinkedIn marketing to grow your business and your personal brand by solidifying yourself as a thought leader in your area of expertise.

However, while paid placements can be tremendously valuable, the platform is really about the engagement.[quote]It’s more than simply posting updates and interesting articles, though that’s a great starting point.[/quote] If you want to be truly effective at using LinkedIn, it’s important to incorporate it into your overall business development initiatives.

[/featured]

One of the easiest ways to get started using LinkedIn to help grow business is to develop a strategy. This way, you can create goals and desired outcomes, and can even create a playbook of best practices.

Because LinkedIn is a professional social media outlet, as opposed to Facebook or Twitter, which are designed more for general interest, it’s easy to overlook the effectiveness of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">creating a LinkedIn campaign</a> the way you’d create a Facebook or Twitter campaign. But, if you’re planning to attend a conference soon, you can develop a creative LinkedIn campaign to do outreach, with an attempt to set up meetings prior to the conference or introduce yourself to noted speakers. Or, if you’re pushing out a new product, you can reach out to your network on LinkedIn for feedback and validation. Hearing from people in your related field can prove much more valuable than the feedback you might get from friends and family. Active involvement with LinkedIn groups and engagement with your favorite companies is a great way to make the most of LinkedIn.

In using LinkedIn as an effective business development tool, it’s important to consider the value proposition you’re offering. You don’t want to waste anyone’s time, and this holds especially true if you’re reaching out to a person in a powerful position to help you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">achieve your business goals</a>. If you’re asking someone for a meeting, think about what you can offer him or her. Is it as simple as a cup of coffee, or can you offer to introduce that person to someone else who might be in a position to help them? Having an idea in mind of how you can help them is a great way to facilitate contact, and creates a more tailored experience than just a sales pitch.

Like any campaign, using LinkedIn as an outreach tool requires <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">testing and optimization</a>. Experiment with InMail subject lines and outreach strategies. Creating goals can help you measure the success of your campaign, and can help you revise future campaigns to make them more effective.

If you’re having trouble managing your contacts due to the sheer breadth of them, look into using tools such as <a href=""http://contactually.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Contactually</a> to help store and manage your contacts. This program provides easy ways to keep in touch, so that your contacts remain on your “hot leads” list until you close a deal.

Six of the Best Copywriting Tips From Our BIGEYE Team,"It’s springtime again, and even if you haven’t gotten around to doing much spring cleaning yet, there’s one thing we can suggest you clean up: your business’s copywriting strategies.

Good copy can sell a product. Great copy, on the other hand, can sell a way of living. Think of Nike’s “Just do it,” or Apple’s “Think different.” Both are powerful slogans that also give immediate insight into how the brand is trying to improve your life.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">Copywriting</a> is as much of a skill as it is an art. Ask a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriter</a> where her most brilliant ideas come from, and many times she’ll tell you it was simply a moment of inspiration, or an experience that excited her and got her thinking. That’s something you can’t necessarily learn in an ad agency.

However, we can certainly try to achieve those effects in more structured environments. Here now are some copywriting strategies from the pros at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> to help your business bloom faster than an orchard full of orange blossoms.

A quick note: the word “copywriting” can mean lots of things, but in this instance, let’s say that the term “copy” means any words that we’re using to market a business or brand, in whichever capacity you need them. Most people tend to think of this in terms of marketing copy on websites, blog and in print, but for our purposes, we’ll say copy can extend to presentations and social media as well. Here, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> presents 6 of the best copywriting tips to assist you in your efforts:
<h3>1. It’s About the Audience</h3>
Marketing copy should always be about your audience. It’s easy as a marketer to think about your business in terms of what you’re selling, but it is important to remember that you must have the audience’s interests in mind at all times. Writing with this in the back of your mind will help you come up with powerful copy that genuinely speaks to the reader.
<h3>2. Focus on the Words</h3>
As most writers know, it’s important to parlay information, often in just a few short words. However, in this cluttered world, it is exceedingly important to stand out in terms of voice, mission and vision. Stay away from buzzwords, overused phrases or cliches. Discard tired words and figure out ways to replace them, and try to find ways to make your business’s copy fun and interesting.[quote]Don’t be afraid to use a curse word or inject a bit of humor, as long as it <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">matches your brand’s voice</a>.[/quote] Also, avoid ambiguous language.
<h3>3. Aim for Stronger Verbs</h3>
If verbs imply action, then it follows that using verbs in your copy can also inspire action. There are dozens of online thesauruses, so pick your favorite one and use it as a tool to help you think of better verbs for your marketing copy.
<h3>4. Use Similes and Metaphors</h3>
Using metaphors and similes can create vivid imagery in a reader’s mind. People can find themselves swept away by powerful similes and metaphors, leading to a persuasive effect that entices people to purchase goods and services.

[quote] <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/a-rockin-legacy/"">BIGEYE created some rockin’ content for an Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children donorship event. Check it out!</a> [/quote]
<h3>5. Understand Your Demographic</h3>
A young, hip audience is going to be much more open to edgy copy than a high-end luxury retailer. To gain a deeper understanding of your audience, look through magazines to get an idea of the types of voices already out there, and let them inspire your own copy. Think about the consumer demographics as well as their interests, and try to tap into that. For instance, <a href=""http://seamlessweb.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Seamless</a>, a food delivery service in several big cities throughout the United States, often creates campaigns that liken its services to issues busy metropolitan adults face on a daily basis. One example: “Stilettos don’t puddle jump,” which, in four short words, explains the benefits of ordering in, as opposed to traveling out in the rain to go to a restaurant. Creating customer personas can help you better understand your audience.
<h3>6. Remember to Explain How Something Benefits Someone</h3>
It’s much more compelling to explain to someone the emotional benefits of a product or service than simply the features. People want to know why these things are going to make their lives better. They don’t want to know you’re selling a “brown hat.” They want to know that the hat will make a person seem stylish and posh. Thinking from this perspective can help you sell the story that sells the brand.

5 Mom Marketing Tips for Your Travel Industry Strategy,"People travel because they like to experience something new. They may wish to experience the relaxation of a different setting, an educational experience or a thrill seeking tour full of activities such as skiing, safari and <a href=""https://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/"">theme parks</a>. However, when people have children, the vacation dynamic may shift, so it’s key for the travel industry to understand mom marketing.

For women with children, vacation may have at one time been an escape for one’s self, either alone, with a spouse or with friends, but it may not involve the entire family, or else moms with older children may opt to leave the kids with a relative. Depending on the type of mom segment, our Florida advertising agency has found that marketers can reach out to these women by targeting the following appeals.
<h3>1. Adventure</h3>
No one loves a fun, educational experience more than a parent. In households where the mother makes many of the purchasing decisions, the mom may find value in visiting museums, exploring nature and <a href=""https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/animal-kingdom/"">visiting the zoo</a>. All of these provide opportunities for children to engage their curiosity, helping them to explore the world around them and to view it in new ways. Marketing strategies that appeal to a mom’s adventurous side may entice them to visit a unique travel destination, to sign up for an interesting tour or to embark on an adventure that is fun for the entire family.
<h3>2. Fantasy, Escape &amp; Relaxation</h3>
Sometimes moms just need a break. Cruise lines are notorious for marketing in ways that offer people a glimpse into the world around them. Cruising and other luxury travel allows moms to escape the pressures of balancing work, day-to-day childcare tasks and home issues. Appealing to a mom’s internal desire to escape through fantasy reminds her that she too can take some time away with the family, thereby escaping the real world.
<h3>3. Entertainment</h3>
Entertainment marketers can reach out to moms in ways that entice them to spend. With a variety of options for moms, ranging from relatively inexpensive to outlandish, marketers have good reason to reach out to the mom market to help sell their goods and services. Generating appeals that work directly toward the mom give her an emotional reaction, prompting brand preference and loyalty down the line.
<h3>4. Emotional: Family-Based</h3>
For a family-based entertainment company, an emotional appeal that speaks to the family can help drive moms to invest in such activities for their children and for themselves.[quote]The “fun for the whole family” experience leads to quality time with the kids, as well as helps to create memories that will last a lifetime.[/quote] Moms who want to subject their children to unique events and experiences are apt to respond to an emotional, family-based appeal.
<h3>5. Fantasy: Leave the Kids Behind</h3>
On the other hand, there may be times when moms seek entertainment without the kids by their sides. This may be in the form of a girl’s night out or date night, and many moms can attest to the good feelings that come from a night out on the town. The Sex &amp; the City style-fantasy can appeal to moms everywhere, who are eager to continue to have fun in spite of the fact that they have children at home. An appeal to a mom’s desire for fantasy helps drive brand preference in the modern mom, one who hasn’t abandoned her social, active lifestyle for domesticated motherhood.

4 Ways to Perfect Your Content Strategy From BIGEYE,"Each day, when I log on to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, I see dozens of people trying to feed me content. Many of these people are talented, intelligent and hardworking, but at the end of the day there’s just not enough time for everything.[quote]Rather than trying to read it all, most of us pick out the things that seem most interesting to us, if it’s really good, we decide to share.[/quote] The act of sharing is much more likely if the writers have first thought of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content strategy</a> when posting.

Some marketers are missing the mark in terms of what audiences are looking for in terms of content. Many times, this is because these marketers haven’t done their homework. Unfortunately, instead of being like the old Field of Dreams adage, “If you build it, they will come,” it works much better to think in terms of “If they like it, they will click.”

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando branding agency</a>, we’ve noticed that many businesses develop their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content strategy</a> without doing their homework. They know they need a blog, but instead of trying to hone in on their audiences and what’s important to them, these marketers think about what’s best for them.
<h3> 1. Identify the best channels</h3>
When assessing your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand’s content strategy</a>, it is important to identify the proper channels for your brand. Many people immediately log on to Twitter and Facebook, thinking those are their ideal audiences because they are the most popular. Therefore, they neglect growing networks such as Snapchat and Pinterest, which actually might be best for highly visual brands. Consider which networks might be best for your brand by examining each network’s user demographics, and, if you are already producing content on those networks, by assessing follower engagement. If you feel stretched for resources in trying to maintain profiles across all <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media platforms</a>, choose one or two that work best for your brand, and focus on those.
<h3> 2. Establish relationships with key influencers</h3>
Grow your audience by seeking out <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">influencers</a> in your space. If you can get the attention of the influencer, then that relationship can create numerous ways to connect with your audience. You can often find these influencers through blogs and Google searches, as well as tools like <a href=""http://FollowerWonk.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FollowerWonk.com</a>, which gives information about individual Twitter accounts, the people who follow them, and the people they follow. Follow and engage with leaders in your space, and also follow the people they follow in order to help facilitate growth.
<h3>3. Rethink your email strategy</h3>
Then, see how your audience is responding to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email strategy</a>. If you don’t have a strategy for your email list, then start collecting emails and create a strategy right now! Not only can you share your own content, but you can also share others’content, which people tend to appreciate if they find it useful. A digest of your brand’s content can be a great way to offer additional audience touch points to information you’ve already published on your blog or social media. There are numerous email platforms out there, but <a href=""http://mailchimp.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">MailChimp</a> and <a href=""http://constantcontact.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Constant Contact</a> are two of the most affordable email platforms that also offer email analytics and guides.
<h3>4. Cover relevant topics on your blog</h3>
Blogs are great tools for giving your audience interesting information within your space. Readers come to rely on and trust the blogs they love, which helps solidify the relationship between the creator and the audience. They’re also great for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> purposes. Make sure your blog is covering relevant topics by staying on top of current events, looking at what interests your influencers and showing that your business is keeping its finger on the pulse of what’s changing in the industry.

These ideas can then help your marketing team generate a content strategy focused on the most relevant content portals. Once you start seeing success with this strategy, you can then expand to other outlets or start A/B testing in order to optimize the strategy. You can experiment with messaging, headlines, email lengths and more, in order to help create the optimal experience for the user.

4 Ways to Use Google Analytics to Improve Your Website Experience,"For business owners who have never used Google Analytics, the breadth of customer data available can seem overwhelming. However, Google Analytics is an incredibly powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. It allows marketers an in-depth perspective of how people are using a company’s website, which can lead to much broader implications for branding, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO strategies</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/adwords/"">Google AdWords</a> strategies and homepage insights.

I recently had a client who was interested in a homepage redesign. From the outset, it was clear to me that his business’s marketing team didn’t fully understand the relationship between marketing and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website development</a>. After looking at his <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">webpage analytics</a>, I realized a homepage redesign would be crucial to his business’s success. His site was not optimized for mobile, even though 50% of his website visitors came from mobile devices. The site experience was very targeted for the male viewer, even though nearly half of his page viewers were female. And, perhaps most shockingly, his page loading speed was 12 seconds, far higher than the 2-3 seconds it should take to access a page for the first time. That offered a terrific insight as to why his page bounce rate was over 86 percent, in spite of the interesting, relevant content posted on a daily basis. Armed with this knowledge, we knew what steps to take in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">creating a website</a> that would result in a better user experience.

[quote]If you want to know whether your webpage is effective, Google Analytics is quite simply the best place to start.[/quote]While there are entire webinars dedicated to successfully using Google Analytics (I suggest checking out <a href=""https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Google Analytics Academy</a>), the team at our advertising agency in Orlando can suggest a few things to check immediately to help garner insights about your business’s performance.
<h3> 1. Bounce Rate</h3>
The bounce rate indicates any time a site visitor looks at only one page before leaving the site. If your business’s homepage is experiencing a high bounce rate, it’s important to try to figure out why. It might be that your site isn’t optimized for the mobile or tablet experience, or that you aren’t offering clear calls to action that would encourage people to continue exploring the site. A web tool called <a href=""http://optimizely.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Optimizely</a> allows businesses to quickly and easily test homepage elements to try to improve these metrics.
<h3> 2. Average Visit Duration</h3>
Again, if people are coming to your page but not staying on very long, there may be a problem with your landing page experience. However, it may also be that there is a mismatch between the content that is driving people to your site and audience’s actual interests. For example, a “clickbait”headline will succeed in getting more people to your site, but people will leave quickly if the headline isn’t supported by interesting content.
<h3> 3. Conversion Rate</h3>
Conversion rate metrics offer insight into the number people who visit your website, against the number of people who actually “convert.”Conversions typically apply to e-commerce purchases, but can also measure the number of people who sign up for your email blasts or the number of people who book a reservation using the website. If these numbers are low, you may wish to test the effectiveness of various calls to action, play with the visual imagery or experiment with different types of content marketing.

&nbsp;
<h3>4. Behavior Flow Report</h3>
The behavior flow report presents a visualization of how website users navigate from one page or event to the next. This report provides insights into the content on your site that’s driving engagement, and also helps identify potential content issues. Use the segment drop down to segment traffic and better understand how those segments flow through the site. You’ll see how search traffic (for example) flows differently through your site than mobile traffic. The dimensions drop down allows you to narrow results by referral source or medium, and even shows flow from specific keywords. This feature can help identify how visitors from a particular keyword engage with and convert on your site. Data geeks unite around the behavior flow report - it’s a gem.

The fountain located in the middle of Lake Eola is called The Linton E. Allen Memorial Fountain. It was originally build in 1957 but was refurbished in 2011. It is known as the official icon of Downtown Orlando. The fountain can shoot water 9 stories into the air.

Swans have been in Orlando's lakes since the early 20th century. In 1910, Charles Lord brought the 1st pair of swans to Orlando from England. They were placed at Lake Lucerne. Lake Eola can accommodate up to 200 swans, but to prevent crowding on shore, if they population rises above 60, the City finds new homes for the birds at the zoos. There are 5 species of swans at Lake Eola: Royal Mute, Australian Black, Whooper, Black Neck, and Trumpeter.  Did you know that you should avoid giving swans bread? It discolors their wings.

On average, July is the warmest month and January is the coldest. 18 degrees was the record low in 1894, however Orlando’s average low is 63 degrees. The average high is 83 degrees and the record high was 103 degrees in the year 1921.

 	<li>55 West - 377 feet tall</li>
 	<li>Bank of America Center - 409 feet tall</li>
 	<li>Orange County Courthouse - 416 feet tall</li>
 	<li>The Vue at Lake Eola - 426 feet tall</li>
 	<li>SunTrust Center - 441 feet tall</li>
</ul>

Ring ring! Orlando’s first telephone directory was published in 1911 when there were 498 phones.

<strong>The Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts will consist of 3 different theaters:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The Walt Disney Theater will seat 2,700+ attendees and will be used for Broadway shows, as well as concerts and other traveling shows.</li>
 	<li>The Alexis &amp; Jim Pugh Theater will seat 300+ attendees and will be a multi-purpose room ideal for theater, dance, music and education.</li>
 	<li>The Acoustical Theater will seat 1,700 attendees and will be used for symphonies, operas and theater/ballets.</li>
</ul>

How cow! In the early 1880s, an ordinance was passed to keep cows off the Downtown streets.

We get around: Annually, 1 million people ride throughout the Central Business District of Downtown Orlando on the free Lymmo bus service.

Orlando has a $9 billion digital media industry and Downtown Orlando will continue to serve as a hub for technological innovation.

Take Our Career Advice - It's Okay to Fail Sometimes,"Don’t we all wish things would fall into place for us easily, and that there wouldn’t ever be the need for failure? You may have a great job and a great career, but chances are that if you have both of those things, you’ve definitely failed at some point. Take our career advice and know that it's okay, and good, to fail!

Some people in the world just want a steady track in life. Those folks will end up in fitting jobs, and will work in semi-satisfying jobs while the daily grind turns into years of their lives. Sure, they may get raises, but they may never see any real increase in responsibility or any impact that might help make a difference down the road. And that’s okay.

Then, there are others of us who are driven to succeed. This defines each of the team members at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida marketing agency</a>, a team that is ambitious and determined to prosper. Unfortunately, the reality of the matter is that there’s a pretty darn good chance that on your path to success, you may fail.

Failure is not unusual, but the most important thing to remember is that if you fail, it’s because you’re putting yourself out there in the world and trying something new. For most people, the more you fail, the more you ultimately win. And when you win, you win big. When people think of Donald Trump, many fail to remember that some of the billionaire pseudo-celebrity’s businesses have also <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2011/04/29/fourth-times-a-charm-how-donald-trump-made-bankruptcy-work-for-him/"">declared bankruptcy</a>.

[quote]Failing is a learning opportunity.[/quote]Take, for example, a child who is learning how to walk. That child must fail a few times before she can take those steps, steps that will guide her for the rest of her life. But once she learns, she has it, and while that may not always be the case with success, it’s certainly much better than never trying in the first place.

In fact, some argue that failure can even mean freedom. When you fail big time, the worst is over. It offers you freedom to start from scratch, or to know you can rebuild from the bottom. There’s no more refreshing feeling than going out into the world with a clean slate, although it can be hard to see it at the time. How many times have you heard people say that their personal failures have ultimately led to positive changes throughout the course of their lives.

So, if there’s something you’ve been holding back on because of fear of failure, try to put yourself out there, starting today. If the goal is to get healthy, start with a walk around the neighborhood, and put the effort in to eat a little bit healthier each day. If you fail, then that’s okay —at least you’ve started making those important changes, and can use everything you’ve learned to your advantage later down the road.

The Power of the Return Customer in Resort Marketing,"From the time we’re young, many of us can remember traveling to a resort with the family. Some of us went only as far as <a href=""https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/"">Disney</a>, others went to the beaches of North Carolina or California, and some even traveled abroad, either on cruise ships or possibly the ever-popular overseas trip to Europe.

For many, this annual trek to a destination elicits memories and emotional appeal: everyone is having fun, they’re all happy, and they seem to let the real problems of the world slide away from them -  if only for a little while.

For many of us here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando ad agency</a>, these vacations had us staying at the same resorts year after year. This was always because we had a great experience once, and the resort became a reminder of the memories brought about by a fun family vacation.

In an era where we’re clouded by so much distraction, it seems much harder to get people to fall into the patterns we call traditions. That’s why resort marketers must take note: the most important customer you have is the loyal one. Loyalty is earned; people may be able to get better deals or better views elsewhere, but they keep coming back to your business because they know the resort they’ve chosen will always offer an excellent experience.

Resort marketing is all about increasing the number of return visitors, and to do this, marketers should always remember to appeal to the emotions of their audience. Is the resort clientele typically young families? If yes, then it’s important to ensure the marketing emphasized the breadth of children’s activities, as Disney resorts do so well. Or, if the resort prides itself in romance, then advertising the benefits of the romantic getaway will inevitably lure couples to the destination. Showcasing these benefits through advertisers and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> will help people make the choice to return to the resort by leveraging their emotions to help them decide it’s time to get away from it all.

In order to ensure the visitor will return to a particular resort over choosing a competitor, it is imperative to make sure that person has a great experience, and that the stay was directly in line with the individual’s expectations. Cruise lines are great at this, offering unbeatable service and luxury in order to entice visitors to return for future cruises.[quote]Some people go on numerous cruises each year, all on the same cruise line they’ve come to love.[/quote]

Another great way resorts can ensure repeat visitors is by incentivizing their return. Offering discounts and upgrades through loyalty programs is a great way for resorts to continue to improve the experience with each visit. Additionally, by offering incentives to the customer, the customer is more likely to spread the word and invite others to join, which leads to more business for the resort as a whole.

Resorts that offer incentives for return visits are saying, in essence, “Thank you for choosing us.” That statement makes a bold declaration about the brand and leaves a lasting impression on customers. Therefore, our Florida advertising agency suggests resort marketers capitalize on loyalty by offering exclusive offers to previous visitors, as well as encouraging them to participate in loyalty programs for more rewards down the road. Because who doesn’t love it when they’re made to feel special?

The Value of Professional Growth Strategies in Business,"<p class=""Body"">Most startup companies that receive investor funding or scale massively within a couple of years don’t do so without a plan. The plan outlines the vision for the company, the ways in which the organization can generate revenue and ultimate goals of the business. With a solid business plan, a company can go from one small idea to a big business the size of Google or <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/09/investing/facebook-worth-200-billion/"">Facebook</a>. Strategists spend months or even years detailing these plans. So, if a business and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">branding strategy</a> is so crucial to your business, then doesn’t it also make sense to spend some time developing one or more professional growth strategies for yourself?</p>
<p class=""Body"">Most of us tend to do this, at least in a passive manner. When you’re at a career standstill, you might consider the possibility of grad school. Or, when looking for business development opportunities, you might weigh the differences between working in the high-tech neighborhoods of Silicon Valley against exploring the luxurious snowbird communities here in sunny Florida.</p>
<p class=""Body"">But have you ever actually sat down and tried to design a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">business strategy</a> for yourself? By thinking about yourself the same way you might think of a true commodity or service business, you can come to some interesting assessments as to how to best develop your skill set in order to achieve maximum growth.</p>
<p class=""Body"">When business leaders design business plans, they combine several factors. First of all, they think of their current assets. For an individual, this might mean tangible assets such as your home, as well as other assets such as your savings, your years of experience and your education. All of these things can be leveraged in different ways for potential growth opportunities.</p>
<p class=""Body""> Then, they think of those assets in relation to the current landscape in order to make predictions about the future. For an individual, this might mean looking at the current market opportunities and figuring out what you might need in order to better prepare yourself for opportunities down the line. This doesn’t necessary mean taking two years off to enroll in an MBA program; rather, it simply means understanding the changing nature of the world, to essentially make sure you’re not investing your time and energy in dated technology or ideas. If there is a gap in your skill set, you can fill it by taking classes, reading relevant articles and even hands-on experience through volunteering.</p>
<p class=""Body""> Finally, big companies will then design goals for the future. For a business, that might mean sales goals, as well as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaigns</a> to help reach those goals. From a personal standpoint, this might instead mean income goals, or professional development goals. Campaigns might be interpreted as making strategic decisions as to how to spend your time, perhaps by going to more networking events and conferences to help grow your network.[quote]As the saying goes, it’s much easier to get from point A to point B if you know where you’re going.[/quote]</p>
<p class=""Body"">Thinking of yourself as your own small business can help inspire entrepreneurial thinking that not only helps your own personal brand, but also can help create business opportunities that help grow your company. By thinking strategically about personal growth opportunities, you can ultimately add much more value to business, and to your career.</p>

The 3 Ways To Win By Employing Teamwork In Business,"It’s easy to get carried away in personal accomplishments at work. Even a little bit of recognition goes a long way, so many people feel it’s best to work independently in order to get all the credit for a big project. However, while this may be the case in some scenarios, our advertising agency in Orlando believes that working in teams is a much more efficient process. After all, no one person can be great at every single task, and chances are that if you’re an excellent researcher and writer, there might be someone better-equipped to handle finances, graphic design, or even <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website development</a>.

The reality is, the potential to work more efficiently comes from how well the teams work together. Unfortunately, working in teams can also be challenging, particularly when working with someone domineering or with a “social loafer,”a slacker who wants to take credit for the work of the team in spite of that fact that the person hasn’t contributed to the progress of the project. Here, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> presents 3 ways to make teamwork win big for your business:
<h3>1. Assign a project manager.</h3>
One of the best ways to mitigate this is to assign a project manager to oversee the project. The project manager’s role is to ensure the project is moving on time, that budgets are in order and that peoples’needs are being sufficiently addressed. A good project manager is responsible for the outcome of the project and gives the team the support and autonomy to do a good job. The PM should also recognize when people are not carrying their weight, and can then take steps to address those issues. An ideal PM is also a good mediator, as this can be the go-to person when there are disputes amongst company members.
<h3>2. Improv.</h3>
Teams can also strive to employ a tactic that’s very popular in improv comedy philosophy: the art of yes-and. The goal here is to never actively reject an idea, but to build on it to make it stronger and better. This eliminates some of the disagreeableness that can put individuals on the defensive, and in long-form improv, to help to grow the scene as a whole. There’s a reason that so many professionals are being more and more inspired to take <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecenizalevine/2014/10/31/have-a-laugh-and-build-your-career-improv-for-professional-development/"">improv classes</a> or attend corporate improv workshops. It’s not just that they help improve public speaking skills, but also teach a philosophical framework that people can also apply to their everyday lives.
<h3>3. Be social.</h3>
Finally, workplace teams can plan to arrange social activities outside of work hours. This helps facilitate workplace relationships and a sense of camaraderie, which can translate into better collaboration.

[quote]In order to get the most out of teamwork, incentivizing the work of the team through rewards can help individuals come together for a collective goal.[/quote]Within those teamwork rewards, the team at our web agency in Orlando believes that a leader can also plan to recognize individual accomplishments in order to ensure that people don’t put all the hard work on one or two members of the team. Working as a team doesn’t have to be daunting. When workplace teams are effective, everyone wins.

6 things to Look For When Selecting Email Marketing Services,"Recently, a entrepreneur reached out to me, seeking my opinion on the best <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> services for his business. It would have been easy to offer up a few answers and tell him to just choose the cheapest option —but at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we’re also strategists, and we know there’s much more to it then choosing the company that’s offering the cheapest deal right off the bat.

In this case, this business owner was in need of advice to assist his startup with a small email list. His plan: to generate messaging via a weekly or monthly email newsletter. Sounds simple enough, right? Many people would have directed him immediately to <a href=""http://mailchimp.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MailChimp</a>, an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> service that offers its services for free for up to 2,000 subscribers and up to 12,000 emails a month.

And, indeed, MailChimp would be the best service had he been looking to never grow beyond 2,000 subscribers. But we’re marketers, and we know that one of the goals of initiating an email marketing plan is to gain quality new subscribers. There’s a reason MailChimp operates under a freemium business model —its team knows that once you’ve put in the work to build your email list up to more than 2,000 people, you aren’t likely to swap email marketing services because you’ve already taken so much time to learn all of MailChimp’s features.

[quote]When deciding which <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing service</a> works for your business, it’s important to think long-term.[/quote]Where do you expect your business to be in a year? In five years? If you’re a growing commerce business with a popular product, it’s likely that you’ll have well over 2,000 subscribers within the year.

So, which email marketing service is best for your business? Well, it depends on your business needs. Many of the email marketing services offer free trials, so it’s worth it to sign up with those and do some investigating on your own. That said, we understand it isn’t always realistic to do months of testing to choose an email marketing service.

Here are 6 essentials to look for when investigating the most appropriate email marketing service:

<strong>1. Templates:</strong> How easy is it to build a sleek, well-designed email? And, once you have that template, how difficult is it to optimize it? If you find yourself wasting valuable time trying to work out the kinks, then you might need to go with a different provider.

<strong>2. Analytics:</strong> What kinds of analytic data can the service give you about your customers? And, how easy it is to navigate the numbers? Does the tool offer suggestions to help you improve those metrics? Be sure to have a baseline familiarity with the service provider’s analytic features before you commit to the provider.

<strong>3. Mobile Optimization: </strong>How do your emails look when someone opens them on mobile or tablet? In some industries, more than 50% of email opens are on mobile or tablet (and that number is growing every day).

<strong>4. Service:</strong> How does the email marketing service support its customers? Even as a marketing pro, you probably still don’t know as much about email marketing than the team that handles your business’s email marketing. That’s why customer service is essential —an email marketing service with pro coaching can help you optimize your emails to get optimal conversion rates.

<strong>5. Pricing Plans: </strong>Which service provider can give you the most bang for your buck? Because there are so many variances in features and capabilities, it’s important to think long-term rather than going with the cheapest option. Figure out your goals, and then choose the best solution to help you reach them.

<strong>6. Ability to Grow:</strong> As your business continues to grow and evolve, you’ll become aware of the need for more and more features. Some email marketing service providers remain in close contact with their clients, adding new features regularly to keep up with changes in the email marketing landscape.

While we don’t want to advocate for any email marketing service that may not be right for your business needs, here are a few worth checking out.

How to Maximize Budgets with Website Testing Tools,"If you’ve been working in marketing for a while, you probably understand the importance of testing, at least on a theoretical level. When it comes to all things digital, website testing can help you optimize all your processes. But in the real world, when is there ever time to test? Unfortunately, failing to test means you’re relying on blind chance that your marketing plan will work. By failing to take the time to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">test your strategy</a> in order to improve it, you could be costing your company tons of time and resources.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we believe testing is one of the most important aspects of marketing, yet I see many marketers that allocate only a fraction of their budgeted resources to testing. If you’re not testing your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategies</a>, then you are missing out on chances to greatly optimize and improve your marketing and advertising activities.

If you haven’t already, I implore you to sign your business up for <a href=""http://www.google.com/analytics/ce/mws/?utm_expid=71218119-7.lBgmrTO8R3uEDwsxNxa_Nw.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F"">Google Analytics</a>. It is incredibly easy to sign up for Google Analytics, and companies that have not already implemented this data are at a disadvantage in understanding their audiences, user activities and the effectiveness of their marketing strategy. Then, start changing things on your websites to see if you can notice improvements. Does simply changing the verbiage of a call to action increase your site’s conversion rate? You’ll never know unless you test!

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">Engagement metrics</a> such as pages-per-visit, time on page and micro-conversions are great for measuring your whether people are investing their time and energy into your content strategy. Setting up goals is a great way to help track what you’re doing. This can be an email metric, an actual financial conversion or filling out a lead form. And, if you aren’t seeing results, then try making minor adjustments to the site content to see what helps.[quote]Sometimes something as simple as changing the color of a call to action button on a landing page can help to increase clicks.[/quote]

Facebook also shares data about the demographics of your users, and by pulling out the demographic data from Facebook it becomes easier to design a comprehensive content strategy. Sharing metrics can also help gage the effectiveness of individual pieces of content. Compare something humorous to something simply informative. Do you see a difference in response? If so, then perhaps you’re learning that your readers’tastes, and knowing what resonates with your audience can help improve your conversions over time.

You can also help boost the reach of your content by investing in your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a>. Promoted tweets and sponsored stories are great ways to amplify your efforts. Extremely focused keywords can be very cheap, leading to a very cheep per-visit rate. These stories should be interesting, rather than self-promotional. As much as possible, it should seem thoughtful and organic. Test these by trying variations of different posts, and see which ones maximize results. Most platforms that offer promoted options also offer analytics to help review the effectiveness of your paid media.

In testing the effectiveness of your marketing, marketers should also plan to invest in A/B testing. A/B testing involves replicating the exact same test, with a single variable that looks different to different audiences. Ideally, it works best to try only one variable at a time, but we know that in the fast-paced world of marketing, that’s not always possible. Still, any insights you glean from A/B testing can help validate ideas about how your audience reacts to different messaging and imagery. One of the easiest places to start A/B testing is with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a>. <a href=""http://MailChimp.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">MailChimp.com</a> and <a href=""http://ConstantContact.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ConstantContact.com</a> both make A/B testing easy.

Failure to test can cost companies thousands of dollars per year.

Tips on Maintaining Your Contacts for Business Development Success,"At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a>, we believe that our relationships are critical to the success of our business. One of the most important ways to make or break your business is the successful management of your contacts. Your network is the most essential path to strong business development, helping you gain new clients or strategic partnerships that can help you increase your business’s bottom line. It’s hard to keep in touch with everyone, but luckily, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> team presents the following 5 tips on maintaining your contacts - in an effort to help maximize your business development outreach strategy.
<h3>1. Use Templates</h3>
Do you have <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">emails styles</a> that you send on a regular basis, such as follow-ups for coffee or birthday greetings? Use templates to help save time. Lots of CRM (customer relationship management) tools offer templates, but for my money, my favorite is the free one that I can use right through my <a href=""http://gmail.com"">Gmail</a> account. Set it up by going to “Settings”and clicking “Labs,”and enabling “Canned Responses.” You can still edit the email as needed whenever you want to send it. And don’t let the feature name fool you…you can use it for your outreach efforts, too.
<h3>2. Create an Email Marketing Strategy for your Brand</h3>
It seems intuitive that if you have thousands of contacts in your database, you should be able to easily reach them by sending a regular email to update them on information they may find useful. However, you might be surprised how often people tend to overlook this easy way to connect with old contacts and facilitate referrals. Sending emails anytime you have big news, sending quarterly emails with updates and sending emails that are simply collections of useful links are all terrific ways to use email marketing for your brand.
<h3>3. Host a Dinner Party</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">Email marketing</a> is great, but as we all know, nothing beats face-to-face interaction. One of the best ways to get people talking, networking and building opportunities is through a good old-fashioned dinner party. People bond through food, and by carefully designing a guest list that brings people with similar interests together, you’re not only building your network but are also offering the opportunity for them to build theirs over cocktails and delicious food. Talk about a great value proposition! If you don’t think you have a prime location to host a dinner party, ask a friend, and go in on it together.
<h3>4. Continue the Conversation on Social Media</h3>
One of the reasons I love <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> is because it allows me to connect with people I may not be in contact with via email on a regular basis. When an old friend comments on a Facebook post, it reminds me that I do, in fact, have a relationship with that person, and that the person is interested in what I’m up to as well. Even if it’s hard to find time for a coffee meeting with an old friend or colleague, you can at least keep up the conversation on social, by commenting or replying to their posts and remaining in their vision. I’ve reconnected with several influential contacts as a result of a simple Facebook post, which in turn have led to new client relationships.
<h3>5. Invest in a Contacts Management Tool</h3>
Recently, a friend told me about <a href=""https://www.contactually.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Contactually</a>, a tool that helps people manage their contacts and ensures important contacts don’t fall off the radar. While real estate agents have become huge advocates of this tool due to the nature of their work, it also has great implications for people who are simply interested in maintaining contact with their personal connections as well. Contactually has built-in templates and will send regular reminders for you to follow up with contacts who may have slipped through the cracks.[quote]With built-in analytics, you can keep up with your progress on a daily basis.[/quote]

At BIGEYE, we work hard to develop and maintain relationships with important contacts that in turn can also assist our clients.

Here are the Tips for Comprehending Consumer Behavior,"Imagine that I owned a store next to your office, where you would occasionally drop in to buy candy. Imagine I were to tell you that you could buy some candy today for full price, but that you could come back tomorrow and all the candy would be 75% off, chances are you’d wait until the next day to buy that candy (unless you were seriously craving some Hershey’s Kisses!). After all, you can save a lot of money that way, so it seems like the rational thing to do.

However, the entire story changes when the dates matter. Imagine I told you that candy would be cheap tomorrow, February 15, because it’s the day after Valentine’s Day. If you were standing in the store on February 14 because you hadn’t already gotten your partner a gift, you’d gladly pay full price.

While it seems technically irrational, it’s a matter of understanding the emotional needs of a consumer. A person isn’t necessarily always driven by the lowest price —there are so many competing factors that brand managers need to take into consideration when they try to comprehending consumer behavior.

Luxury brand managers are able to do this with expert finesse. People will often irrationally spend money on impractical items simply because of the prestige that comes with owning such a product. Think of a wedding ring. People are willing to pay so much for diamonds because of the symbolic representation of what a big, beautiful ring implies.

Of course, that doesn’t mean that you have to be a luxury brand to be able to capitalize on human emotions. People purchase Nike shoes because they feel inspired by the brand, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand’s image</a>, and the brand’s commitment to improving individuals through athleticism. Or, a person may choose Coke over Pepsi because of the element of nostalgia that comes with purchasing a Coke.

[quote]The good news is that by tapping into consumer behaviors, you can also learn to influence their purchasing habits.[/quote]The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida marketing agency</a> sees this as the entire rationale behind marketing —how can we convince people to spend their dollars with us? The best way to know where to start is to explore differentiation, which means creating and defining a distinguishing characteristic about your business and highlighting it.

Brands with a defined point of view tend to see more success than competitors. Think about any brand you love and think about why you choose it over alternatives: it might be that it’s cheaper, it tastes better, it’s more convenient, or it simply looks more interesting. Emphasizing what sets your business apart from others is the best starting point to build a bigger strategy for your brand.

From there, you can <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">design marketing campaigns</a> around that distinguishing feature. Taking into account these human emotional behaviors, you can create a campaign that’s aspirational, inspirational or just funny —these are all types of things that might encourage a person to use your item or service over a lower-priced competitor.

Why Automobile Companies Must Understand Mom Marketing,"It’s a movie cliche we’ve seen a million times: a woman goes to purchase a car, but gets swindled by a sleazy salesman because she supposedly doesn't know her way around a car. Regardless of whether this was ever an accurate depiction of women’s role in the automobile purchasing process, this is certainly not the case today. To draw on another cliche: the times, they are a-changin’! So, automobile marketers need to embrace mom marketing.

A new report from Cars.com shows that <strong>73% of moms consider themselves to be the sole decision-maker in the vehicle shopping process</strong>. And, it makes sense — after all, if you’re going to have to haul Sammy and Stella from soccer practice to swim team to ukulele lessons, then it’s important to make sure you’re able to do it safely and comfortably.

In the era of smartphones, tablets and lightweight laptops, it’s easy to research a car from anywhere with an Internet connection. And, granted that I can spend close to an hour trying to find a good restaurant on Yelp, I can also spend far more time trying to find the right vehicle to meet my needs.

However, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando ad agency</a> has noticed that when you see TV ads for new cars, they’re nearly always marketed toward men. But if moms have so much influence on the car purchasing process, doesn’t it make sense to try to court them through marketing, too?

In viewing a compilation of Superbowl <a href=""http://jalopnik.com/5981258/the-2013-super-bowl-car-commercials-watch-all-of-them-here##kxsegs=o7mp4e3md,o9i68fk9g,pexi6me2k"">car commercials</a>, I noticed that not one of them featured a female driver. Whether this is more of a response to the automobile marketing landscape or simply just the Superbowl demographic, it still seems strange. After all, of the 111.5 million people who watched the Superbowl, 50 million were female.

Yet for some reason, these car companies don’t seem to care as much about attracting moms. It’s interesting because moms tend to have a lot of say in most major purchases across the spectrum - we’re not just talking about cleaning supplies these days. <strong>The purchasing power of millennial moms is estimated at $170 billion</strong>. And, if moms are making the car-buying decisions, then why are these companies trying so hard to sell to dad?

Car companies that decide to market to women would have an upper hand in trying to lure their business, since as it stands right now, there is so little competition in that space. And, we’re not talking about trying to sell women on light pink minivans with extra compartments to keep makeup. Women need cars to be useful and practical.

Moms tend to be more concerned with safety and durability, and with all the new safety features the car companies are introducing these days, there’s no reason they shouldn’t think about moms in the marketing process. They also care about gas mileage because lugging children around can put a lot of miles on a car. Focusing on these benefits is a terrific start in helping reach the mom market.

[quote]Women make up more than half of the world’s population, and drive at least half the cars on the road.[/quote]Car companies are already installing the features that make moms happy. As such, the team at our Orlando marketing agency thinks these companies should spend more of their dollars trying to reach moms, who more than ever, are in the driver’s seat in making automobile purchasing decisions.

The Importance of the Role of Design in Marketing,"I recently subscribed to an email list for a friend’s business. But, when I saw the first email newsletter, I found myself very uneasy. The business deals with photography and design, and yet the email that landed in my inbox was a bare-bones, plain text email. You’d think someone like that would put more care into the message he’s trying to convey — maybe I need to tell him that the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> has a few ideas to help him understand the role of design in marketing.

Now, in marketing, each of us has our strengths. I understand that a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriter</a> at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a> shouldn’t necessarily be counted on to design a document, or a strategist doesn’t need to know a ton about website development. But I do think design should permeate through all areas of business.

It’s important to have consistency in all brand assets. This doesn’t just mean <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print ads</a>, but applies to internal and external marketing tools including sales decks, memos, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">website design</a>, social media and, as you saw above, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email experience</a>. The goal here is to make sure you’re <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">telling the same story across all platforms</a>. This will make it easier for people to identify your brand, and they can then follow along for the ride when they see your emails or your Facebook posts. And, it just looks nice!

Thinking about my friend’s photography business, he probably has a number of excellent assets to help sell the story of his business. He’s asking people to spend a lot of money to use his services, and while having an email signup list is a great first step, that list also needs to reflect the essence of the brand he wants to create. A plain text email? I see plain text emails all the time. What I want is for you to really wow me! Use these visual techniques to help entice me to choose you over competitors.

[quote]<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/arsenal-venture-partners/"">BIGEYE created a responsive web design for Arsenal Venture Partners that produced the ideal interaction they were hoping for. Check it out!</a>[/quote]

Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a> should be a reflection of your business. The assets you put on your site and photos that you choose are all ways you market yourself, so it’s important to take care in what you’re presenting to the world. This even goes into the user experience of the site - you need to make sure that if you have a shopping cart feature, it’s easy to use, and that if you have a ton of content on the site, it’s easy to navigate. For some reason, people tend to overlook these essential aspects in trying to design websites —but these days, you can’t afford not to think about them because they translate to real ROI.

Recently, I heard about the <a href=""http://barbariangroup.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Barbarian Group</a>, an innovation agency in New York highly focused on design. True to the brand, when they moved to a new office, they emphasized the importance of design. As such, they created a massive single sharable desk as a place for people to keep ideas flowing. It’s a testament to the fact that design truly permeates every aspect of the business - even in the workplace setup.

The five Tips for Identifying Your Business's Target Audience,"For most companies, your audience is the heart of your brand. When they’re satisfied, it means that the brand has lived up to its promise. People who love their favorite brands can be some of the best marketing resources you have…and you don’t even have to pay them! When your audience is so impressed with your product or service that they’re sharing it with others, you’ve hit the sweet spot in the market —a figurative bulls eye comprised of finding your target audience and filling their need.

But for some companies, the tricky part isn’t necessarily the audience itself; the tricky part is the challenges that present themselves when trying to find the <em>right </em>audience. Your new luxury hotel isn’t going to do so well if you focus all your marketing towards people who don’t travel, and your sports industry business isn’t going to fare well if you spend all your ad dollars trying to reach people who aren’t interested in sports. Seems pretty obvious, right? Unfortunately, it’s not always so straightforward.

Take, for example, a business that sells customized staircases to high-end clientele. This is a very niche need, so rather than trying to build awareness with everyone, you’d need to focus your efforts on a group of people with that specific need. You might have a low conversion rate, but even a single conversion leads to an extremely high-value transaction, the goal is to focus on reaching quality potential customers, as opposed to just reaching a high quantity of people.

So, how do we go about finding your business’s target audience? Here are a few ideas from our Orlando marketing agency.

<strong> 1. Market research reports:</strong> These days, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a> is available all over the web. Some of it you may have to pay for, but it’s usually a wise investment - market researchers from companies like <a href=""http://forrester.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Forrester</a> and <a href=""http://nielsen.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Nielsen</a> have already done the hard work for you, so it’s cheaper than spending your own business dollars to try to glean insights into customer behavior. [quote]There are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research reports</a> on almost every topic under the sun: from organic eating habits to people’s growing use of mobile technology.[/quote] Look to these reports to help you understand the consumer landscape.

<strong>2. Census data:</strong> We often think of the census as that thing the government does every 10 years. However, the <a href=""http://census.gov"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">U.S. Census website</a> has a ton of interesting demographic information that can be extremely useful in targeting people based on geographical needs. Use this in tandem with other research for best results.

<strong>3. Survey data:</strong> Companies like <a href=""http://surveymonkey.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SurveryMonkey</a> and <a href=""http://qualtrics.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Qualtrics</a> are useful for gaining statistical insight into peoples’ activities. Use this information to formulate hypotheses about your target audience, which you can then supplement with research data and test through your communications and marketing strategies.

<strong> 4. Qualitative data:</strong> While often more expensive than the other forms of research listed here, this is one of the best ways to gain insights about your target audience. This is because it frees people to give open-ended responses, giving the person conducting the interview or focus group more opportunities to gain insights beyond a simple yes or no response, as is typically the case with survey data.

<strong> 5. Online listening:</strong> Looking at brand mentions on online platforms can help figure out who influences your brand. By reviewing those <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">peoples’ demographics</a> and their own audiences, you can find out more about them and how they interact with your brand or business. There are a host of online listening tools available, but some favorites here at our Orlando advertising agency are <a href=""http://brandwatch.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Brandwatch</a>, <a href=""http://radian6.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Radian6</a> and <a href=""http://www.sdl.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SDI Social Intelligence</a>.

The Expert Methods For Reaching the Luxury Customer,"<p class=""Body"">When you think of a luxury consumer, what comes to mind? Is it a young tech millionaire? A wealthy housewife? Someone living off of a family trust fund?</p>
<p class=""Body""> At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we believe that if you’re dealing in luxury goods or services, it’s important to have a deep understanding of your customers - and, perhaps more importantly, how they behave in both the world and in the digital space. This is particularly true with higher-end consumers, as their discriminating taste means they have higher expectations than a typical consumer. For this reason, it's critically important to employ expert methods to reach your ideal luxury customer.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Earlier this year, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/14/us-luxury-bain-idUSBREA0D0O420140114"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""Hyperlink0"">Reuters reported</span></a> that the number of luxury goods purchasers increased to 330 million in 2013, and could be as high as 500 million by 2030. The article attributes this growth to rising wealth in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. And, more than half of these purchasers are age 49 or older. Just 13% are between ages 13 and 33.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Contrary to what one might think, an <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2013/05/23/luxury-consumers-value-products-not-buying-experiences/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""Hyperlink0"">article in Forbes</span></a> points out that luxury consumers love to shop at Costco, which is a far from glamorous experience. However, alongside the rows upon rows of bulk toilet paper and paper towels, Costco also sells things like vacation packages, high-quality electronics and expensive watches. It’s not exactly what you might picture the luxury shopper doing, but it’s important to understand this mindset and behavior. The reality is that even when these consumers are spending a lot of money, they’re still also always looking for a deal.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Many luxury consumers don’t even leave their homes to shop. <a href=""http://www.luxurydaily.com/92pc-of-affluent-consumers-made-online-purchase-in-q4-of-2013-report/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""Hyperlink0"">According to Luxury Daily</span></a>, in Q4 of 2014, 92% of affluent shoppers made a purchase online. <a href=""http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/luxury-shoppers-around-world.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""Hyperlink0"">Think With Google reports</span></a> that in mature markets such as the United States, 69% of all luxury customers searched online before making a purchase, and in newer markets like China, Brazil and Russia, 92% of luxury consumers went online to search before making a purchase.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Knowing that the market is rising and that people are using the Internet to guide their purchases and, in many cases, to actually make purchases, it’s increasingly important for luxury marketers to realize that their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">digital presence</a> is a reflection of who they are as brands. Every time a person has a bad experience with your website or can’t read your email because your business’s emails aren’t optimized for mobile, you’re putting up a figurative wall between your brand and your customer. [quote]Particularly when dealing in luxury goods, the experience is part of the decision-making process.[/quote] It’s hard to convince someone you’re a luxury retailer if your website looks like something you could have designed with clipart on Geocities in 2004.</p>
<p class=""Body"">It’s also becoming more and more important for luxury marketers to engage their communities online. If they’re not actively sharing content and jumping into the conversation, they may be costing themselves thousands of dollars in sales each year. The Internet is full of rich data as to how people are using their luxury products and services, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">conducting a social media listening</a> audit is typically much less expensive than a focus group.</p>

5 Ways to Spice Up Tried-and-True Office Routines,"The everyday office routine can become pretty mundane day in and day out. With hours spent drafting documents, sitting in meetings and refreshing your email inbox, it is easy to fall into a monotonous pattern and struggle to stay creative and passionate about your work. But, no fear! <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> is here with some useful tips to brighten up that snoozer of a workday and bring back your former creative spark and drive - here, we bring you the following 5 ways to spice up tried-and-true office routines:
<h3> 1. Communal Lunches</h3>
Whether you order in lunch for the whole team or simply agree to all convene and eat at a specific time, holding a communal lunch is a terrific way to start great conversations and elevate the overall mood and atmosphere of the office. The lunch can give people something to look forward to in the morning and boosts everyone’s energy for the afternoon!
<h3> 2. Bring A Pet</h3>
With your bosses and colleagues approval of course, having a dog or cat friendly office or a designated “Bring Your Pet to Work Day” can help add excitement and even a much needed relaxation outlet throughout the day. What a better way to shake off tension from a particularly stressful meeting than by petting a furry friend at your desk. A pet can completely change the mood of your office environment and adds a bit of fun!
<h3><strong> </strong>3. Redecorate Your Workspace</h3>
Every few months change up your workspace by rearranging your setup, bringing in fun trinkets or changing out the pictures in your photo frames. A change of scenery may help reenergize and maybe even help you look at your work from a new perspective!
<h3><strong> </strong>4. Play Some Music</h3>
It’s proven fact that music can drastically alter moods, so why not use that power and play some cool jams in your office while working? If you work in a communal area try using an app like Jukebox for <a href=""http://spotify.com"">Spotify</a> to play music that everyone can listen to. These apps enable your entire team to add songs to the current playlist from their phone and vote up songs that they want to listen to more. It can even add a fun competition to see who can get their song at the top of the playlist.
<h3> 5. Do Something Nice For Your Colleagues</h3>
We all could use a little good karma now and then, and it’s a known fact that doing things for others helps boost your own mood as well. So, next time you’re out on a coffee run bring back your coworker their favorite drink. Or you could do something as simple as leaving a sticky note compliment on your coworker’s desk while he or she is away. Whatever it is, doing something nice can add a little extra something to you and your colleague’s day. So why not give it a try next time you’re looking to break the everyday routine?

Using the Benefits of Luxury Industry Branding To Your Advantage,"If you work in the luxury market, chances are you know something about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">branding</a>. You know how important it is for the brand to know its customer inside and out, and to use this knowledge to continue to build and sell products or services that create a meaningful experience for those indulging in aspirational lifestyles. Your brand is your identity - from your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo</a> to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a> to the voice in which you communicate on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media</a>, there’s a line that offers immediate recognition. It creates that feeling that the essence is “on-brand.”

Unfortunately, sometimes luxury industry branding includes making decisions that lead them down the wrong path. For instance, they may start producing lower quality goods in order to increase the bottom line.[quote]But the reality is, especially in the luxury industry, that customers can see right through this.[/quote] Making a person spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a shoddy project is a guaranteed way to make sure they never buy from you again. And, even worse, in this social media-driven world, you can bet that the person who has a bad experience is going to log on to <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/12/social-media-we-complain-879-million-timesyear-and-facebook-is-our-top-target/"">Facebook</a> and Twitter to complain about the experience to friends and followers. Imagine how rough it would be to recover if said unhappy customer is a fashion blogger with a million followers!

But brands do other things to dilute their brands, too, and in some cases, without even knowing it. For example, if your brand voice isn’t <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">consistent on social media</a>, that quickly becomes evident to your followers. People follow you because they’ve come to recognize a certain standard associated with you and your business. If you’re a high-end luxury brand that exudes class and elegance, you could lose credibility in tweeting out images of Miley Cyrus’s infamous tongue. It’s important to understand the types of things that drive your customers so you can keep your finger on the pulse of what’s relevant in their lives.

And, when it comes to luxury industry branding, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando marketing agency</a> knows that more followers doesn’t necessarily translate to a better brand. I don’t fully understand the practice of buying followers from so-called “click farms” in other countries, because even if it does inflate your follower count, you’ve just paid for the experience of having tons of followers who don’t actually care about your brand. Sure, the number looks good, but with no real engagement, it seems like a waste of money. But this doesn’t just relate to click farms - this experience of doing off-brand activities in order to help raise your follows and likes can actually have a detrimental effect on your brand. Sure, you may get more exposure, but if that exposure is from people who don’t represent your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">target audience</a>, then this can easily dilute your brand’s value on social media.

Another way you may be diluting the value of your brand is by having <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media accounts</a> that haven’t been updated in months. People follow you because they have an expectation from you, and if you don’t have the bandwidth or strategy to extend to that social media account, it’s important to assess whether you should take it down entirely. It’s my opinion that for most businesses on most platforms, having no page is better than having an inactive page.

If you’re a luxury brand, you have to act like a luxury brand —this is true in brick and mortar locations, as well as in the digital space. Remember that in branding, the customer is savvier than you think.

Here are the Four Fun Content Ideas to Boost Engagement,"Ever notice how the ads that people like best during the Superbowl are the funny ones? This shouldn’t be a surprise, because people love to be entertained (and if you don’t believe me, just take a look at how many movies you’ve watched on Netflix in the last month!).

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Florida advertising agency</a>, we know companies don’t have to be super serious to also be perceived as professional. Take, for example, <a href=""https://www.geico.com/about/commercials/#.VVTmVJNVhBc"">Geico</a>, which deals with heavy insurance matters on a daily basis, many of which involve injury or even death. The brand could have taken an approach that touted the seriousness of the business and its commitment to all things insurance, but can you deny that would have been slightly, well…boring? Instead, it opted to give in to the creative impulse, generating an Australian talking lizard that is now etched into the mind of every person in America (whether we want him to be or not).

My point is that your content doesn’t have to be stuffy, even if your industry isn't all that laid back. As such, we've developed 4 fun content ideas that can help break your brand from the strongholds of thinking everything has to be all business, all the time. In looking at this list and generating your own <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">creative content ideas</a>, remember that people are most likely to share funny posts and uplifting content (hence, the success of sites like Buzzfeed and Upworthy). [quote]By generating your own content in this capacity, you’ll be giving your followers plenty to talk about.[/quote]

<strong>1. Stop-motion Vines: </strong>Who’d have thought a company like Lowes would have been a pioneer in the land of 6-second videos? Lowes’s series of Vines give you practical home tips with a DIY aura…all in six seconds! Check out this <a href=""https://vine.co/v/bU61aqq2YOp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">screwdriver/rubber band tip</a> and tell me you’re not impressed.

<strong>2. Throwback Thursdays: </strong>What started out a few young people posting photos from their childhood on Instagram and Facebook is now a full-on trend. People love to see these photos from the times when you actually had to walk two miles in the snow uphill both ways to get to a place that would print out your photos. Even if your business isn’t necessarily trendy or cool, you can still tap into this trend by showing old photos of your founders or your first brick-and-mortar location, or even a photo of an old newspaper clipping about your business that you have hanging around. Just don’t forget to tag them “#tbt.”

<strong>3. One-Second-a-Day Videos:</strong> These <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">types of videos</a> can be extremely fun and inspiring, and take literally, one second a day to create (plus perhaps a little bit of time at the end to edit). Try showing one second a day from your work or your office to capture just a slice of your daily work. For a slightly different variation on this, make a one-minute video featuring exactly one second at 60 of your favorite local landmarks. And, the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday/id587823548?mt=8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">1 Second Everyday</a> app makes it super simple to record.

<strong>4. Awards and Recognition: </strong>People love to be recognized, and when you offer them some form of recognition, they’ll typically share that with their social circles. Recently, a friend of mine was recognized by a small women’s group. The company wrote a blog about her and invited her to speak at a free monthly panel discussion. The cost? Perhaps a couple of hours to write the blog and plan the event, and a few dollars to provide food and beverages at the panel. However, when the recipient shared her blog, the blog post generated thousands of page views, hundreds of likes, several shares on Facebook and tons of goodwill in the community. Recognizing a strong employee, young leader or a powerful member of your community is a great way to build visibility.

8 Simple Time Management Tips to Boost Your Efficiency,"Let’s face it: we live in a world where we are surrounded by distractions. At any given minute, there are what feels like more than one hundred phone calls to make, thousands of people to chat with on Facebook, and over a million emails to respond to. Sometimes, it seems impossible to get it all done…and oftentimes, that’s because it is.

One of the most essential skills I’ve learned in the business world is the art of time management. It’s not easy to manage all those meetings, projects, tasks and interruptions, but luckily I’ve had the luxury of learning a few tips that have helped me navigate through the mess. The team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our advertising agency</a> hopes that the following 8 simple time management tips to help you boost your efficiency help to make your daily grind a little less taxing.
<h3>1. Figure Out How Long Things Really Take</h3>
Notice how sometimes things we think we can get done quickly tend to take much longer, and we find ourselves wondering where the time went? For one day, walk around with a stopwatch and time yourself doing everything you do on a regular day. How long does it take you to brush your teeth? How long is your commute? How long does it take you to go into <a href=""http://starbucks.com"">Starbucks</a> and get your morning latte? Once you figure out how long things really take, you can be more realistic about how much time you need to set aside in your day…and where to trim the fat from your daily schedule.
<h3> 2. In One, Out One</h3>
You may have heard this concept before. The idea is that if something comes in (for example, a new pair of shoes), you have to get rid of one of the same thing (in this case, a different pair of shoes). This will keep your clutter to a minimum and will prevent you from getting overloaded with junk.

While this may be a rule for personal organization, it also relates to business organization in that every time you get a new business tool, it’s time to get rid of an old one. Some companies use multiple CRMs, project management tools, and pipelines, but don’t use any of them very consistently. Get rid of all those tools, documents and internal projects that are simply causing clutter.
<h3> 3. Everything Has One Home, and One Home Only</h3>
How long does it take you to save a file to the right place? Ten seconds, max? Yet for some reason, we’re often apt to save to our desktops or some other place where the file doesn’t belong, only to spend hours looking for that document later on.

[quote]Searching for lost documents is one of the business time-wasters, even at the executive level.[/quote] By ensuring everything has one home, you’ll always be able to find what you need when you need it. But, this doesn’t apply only to computer files. You can also apply it to things around your house like keys and shoes, and to items at the office like supplies and paper documents.
<h3> 4. Be as Paperless as Possible</h3>
Speaking of paper documents, one of the best ways to reduce clutter is to be as paperless as possible. Who here hasn’t spent hours searching for a single copy of that one important document that you intended to take home and read over the weekend? Invest in an <a href=""https://www.apple.com/ipad/"">iPad</a> and make sure you’re applying the rules above to manage your documents, and watch all your paper clutter disappear.
<h3> 5. Manage Your Calendar to Budget for Every 15 Minutes of Your Day</h3>
There’s rule we have around the office, which is that if we budget for it, it’ll happen. This doesn’t only apply to projects that require funding, but it also applies to time: if you slice out time in your day to address certain things, you can be sure those will get done. Many people do this the night before so they can make sure to assign time to address each outstanding item.

If you’re having trouble sticking to this schedule, then try to set up working meetings with colleagues to help keep you on task. In the same way that going to the gym with a friend can help motivate you, working with someone else on a defined task can help keep you in check.
<h3> 6. No Agenda, No Meeting</h3>
Early on in my career, I found that meetings tended to derail pretty quickly. So, I started forcing people to provide meeting agendas, which helped us stay on task and cover the areas needed. Along this line, I also didn’t wait until the end of the meeting to instruct someone to send a recap with next steps. Rather, I assigned someone to send this recap at the beginning of the meeting, and worked to ensure this task was complete before the meeting’s conclusion. I’ve found that these two steps seem to make meeting time much more productive.
<h3> 7. Don’t Underestimate the Power of “Yes”or “No”</h3>
How often do you spend too long drafting a lengthy response to an email that you could have just answered with “Yes”or “No”? If you think about it, you’ll probably find it’s more often than you think. In 99% of these cases, “Yes”and “No”are fine responses.
<h3> 8. Use Email Subject Lines to Convey Messages</h3>
If you’re only listing a short message or response, include it in the subject line. That way, you don’t even have to send a full email, and the person reading can simply look at their inbox to see the response. This saves time for both the sender and the reader. The first time you use this trick with a new person, be sure to write “EOM (End of Message)”so that the person knows the message is complete in the subject line, and then you can use the acronym EOM at the end of subject line responses in the future.

Cultivating Community Through an Event Based Strategy,"At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we believe that in building your business, it’s becoming increasingly important to try to build a community around what you do. Building a community fosters engagement both online and offline, encouraging people to share their thoughts and opinions and to make their voices heard. One of the best ways to cultivate a community of people is through an event based strategy. Most of the strongest communities I’ve seen are those in private clubs and membership organizations and are hugely events-based, hosting more than 300 events a year in order to help keep their members and communities happy while simultaneously helping them grow their networks. But even if you’re not a fancy private club or a networking group, you can still take advantage of the sense of belonging that an events-based community strategy offers to your customers.

Since the era of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, the term “community”seems to have taken on a life of its own. To older people who aren’t actively using social media on a regular basis, “community”is synonymous with “social media,”which in reality is only partially true. A community manager’s job is to engage the community, and while social media may be part of that, so is blogging, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> and, of course, event marketing.

In order to run an effective event-based community strategy, it’s essential to know what your community wants. Do this by requesting information via <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/online-survey-company/"">survey data</a>, with specific questions about what you think they might enjoy. Wine stores might benefit from tasting events and private wine classes for VIP customers, while luxury hospitality businesses might want to woo their customers with formal dining events and open bar cocktail parties sponsored by popular liquor brands. Depending on your business, it’s important to know the time of day people are interested in attending (breakfast, lunch, happy hour, evening or all-day events) and which day of the week they prefer (for instance, people who have 9-5 jobs and small kids may prefer family-friendly weekend events to after-work events). Responding to their needs also shows that you truly understand your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a>, which is extremely important for any business.

Oftentimes, businesses that are faring pretty well have no desire to explore other ways to generate more business, particularly because they don’t realize how much more money they can generate by doing so.[quote]The good thing is that businesses of any size can hold events for nearly any budget.[/quote] If you have a space and a reason for people to gather, the potential is there…and things like appetizers and beverages can only sweeten the deal. If you’re using the information from the survey data and you’ve been careful to find out the types of events interest your group, then you should have no problem identifying potential guest speakers or planning leisure activities that can also help facilitate community involvement around your business or brand.

The problem for many people is that events aren’t always direct revenue drivers. Take, for example, a lawn care company that hosts a free wine and cheese client appreciation event. This may cost several hundred dollars in securing a location, providing food and beverage, and lost work hours in planning the event. It may be even more if you plan to create signage or need to purchase nametags and other supplies. But, if that small event encourages your clients to share their experiences with their friends and colleagues, and one of those referrals turns into a new client for the business, then it was well worth the time.

Events are great because they can build online and impersonal interactions into more genuine connections. From a business perspective, this makes good sense because the more people are engaged with your community, they more likely they are to hang around. We'd love to help you connect with your audience at-large - <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact us</a> to determine how we can help craft your engaging event based strategy!

Listen to the top eight TED Talks on marketing now,"Inspirational speakers can really motivate people to think differently and make smarter choices. When it comes to the marketing world, one good innovative idea can mean the difference between branding success and downfall. TED talks serve as an idea platform for viewers across the world by delivering interesting discoveries and starting conversation about topics people may forget about.

Compiled below are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE'</a>s Top 8 TED talks on marketing; these articles hold unique perspectives on how to attain true success in our ever-changing industry. From consumer preference and perception to branding, these talks are thought provoking and even humorous.
<h3>1. Malcolm Gladwell:<strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIiAAhUeR6Y"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Choice, Happiness, and Spaghetti Sauce</a></strong></h3>
This talk discusses the importance of striving for preference rather than perfection. There is no perfect solution to make every single one of your consumers happy. Your product or service must be adaptive to diverse opinions and tastes. Gladwell uses a brand of spaghetti sauce to prove that offering specific choices creates your own niche market, which in turn, increases sales.
<h3>2. Rory Sutherland:<strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=audakxABYUc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Life Lessons from an Ad Man</a></strong></h3>
Value is a matter of perception and persuasion, which is better than compulsion. At least that’s what this TED talk is centered around. Rory Sutherland discusses why it is important to use perception to your advantage. To be successful, businesses must understand it is seen through a consumer’s eye. The examples featured throughout this talk prove that simple manipulation of perception can create the best solutions to marketing problems.
<h3>3. Joseph Pine:<strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RD0OZCyJCk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">What Consumers Want</a></strong></h3>
Customers like to think that what they buy is authentic and real. However, Joseph Pine makes it clear that selling authenticity is tough because there is no such thing. But, there is such thing as creating “artificial” experiences and still make millions. Consumers want to buy experience more than anything, and this talk emphasizes the importance of staying true to who the business is in order to provide the most authentic experience possible.
<h3>4. Morgan Spurlock:<strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2jyjfcp1as"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Greatest TED Talk Ever Sold</a></strong></h3>
This talk is particularly interesting because Morgan Spurlock documents his journey and presents it in clips. He shares his quest to make a completely sponsored film about sponsorship, and takes you into the offices of different businesses. Not only is this talk funny, but it also educational as it explores the way many business go about brand marketing.
<h3>5. Sheena Iyengar:<strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pq5jnM1C-A"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">How To Make Choosing Easier</a></strong></h3>
It’s easier for consumers to feel overwhelmed by choices. Even walking into a convenience store to buy toothpaste can be a headache. With 50 different options staring you down, it can be difficult to make a fast decision. In this talk, Sheena Iyengar reveals a solution to this problem by giving businesses ways to improve the experience of choosing.
<h3>6. Dan Cobley: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cwW_S29faQ"">What Physics Taught Me About Marketing</a></h3>
Using Newton's second law, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the scientific method and the second law of thermodynamics, this marketing director from Google explains how marketing and physics have more in common than you may imagine.
<h3>7. Josh Luber: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q49LtMyXK7Q"">Why Sneakers Are A Great Investment</a></h3>
The secondary market for sneakers in the United States represents a 1.2 billion dollar industry. In this talk, Josh, who is one part sneakerhead and one part data geek, explains how Nike’s customers made almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor last year.
<h3>8. Mary Norris: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rToBZSrxjgM"">The Nit-Picking Glory of The New Yorker's Comma Queen</a></h3>
Meet Mary Norris, a charmingly precise, well-spoken copy editor from the New Yorker. Copywriters and wordsmiths of all sorts will swoon at her detail orientation toward word selection.

"Know the Difference, Content Creation vs Content Curation","At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we know we live in an era where content is key. Good content can help engage your community, keep your business relevant in the eyes of your audience and can even impact your business’s ranking in search. But, good content doesn’t come without a cost, and even within that framework, different types of content generate different types of results.

However, one of the questions we come across most frequently in talking about content is whether it’s more efficient to create content, or to curate it. First, let’s discuss the difference between content creation vs content curation.
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Content created by your marketing team</a> or business helps you get your own perspectives into the hands of your audience. This is typically comprised of things like original tweets, blogs, Facebook posts, infographics and all other content that someone creates on behalf of your business that you could potentially share via social media, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a>.

The benefit of this type of content is that if it’s shared, it’ll directly point others back to your business. Some studies show that original content is more helpful in creating conversions. This may be because original content about your area of expertise helps to build trust with the audience who will ultimately purchase from your company.

[/featured]

However, content creation can take significant effort to maintain. Many people start businesses and plan to incorporate blogs, only to find that blogging takes a lot of time and resources, resources you may not have if your business is working with a small staff. Still, these businesses seek to continue to create content in order to help maintain visibility and establish trust with their audience.
<h3>Content Curation</h3>
Content curation is the act of sharing content created by others. This might mean an interesting article, a great visual, an interesting tweet or even just a funny gif.

Sites like Twitter make it extremely easy to share others’ content, but even sites like LinkedIn fill their content base by relying mostly on content created by others. For companies that primarily curate content, people can come to rely on your business as a great way to seek content on a variety of relevant topics that reach your target audience.

Content curation typically takes less effort than content creation, but it’s still important to take the time to read each piece of content to make sure it’s completely on brand, and proposes an opinion you’re willing to support.

Posts linking to third-party content tend to get more clicks. Realistically, the best content on the web probably comes from large media organizations with high brand recognition, so it makes sense that links from smaller sites might not have as many clicks.
<h3>Content Creation and Content Curation: The Sweet Spot</h3>
Many effective strategies apply a mix of each of these. Businesses can supplement some original content with content from third parties in order to help keep the original content flowing. This is a solid balance between the struggles of maintaining original content and the more passive engagement of curating content.

In terms of conversions, companies that balance both types of content seem to generate the most conversions, according to <a href=""http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-measurement/new-research-finds-the-curation-vs-creation-sweet-spot/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Convince and Convert</a>.[quote]Simply curating content doesn’t do enough to generate interest in your own brand, while creating all your own content comes across as self-promotion.[/quote] Companies should aim to link to others’content 50-75% of the time. This means that in additional to posting original content on your feeds, you should also be following your favorite companies, brands and influencers, and be willing to share their ideas in order to help your business become a go-to spot for the most current and up-to-date content in your industry.

Generate Leads Using a Twitter Marketing Strategy,"You’re social media savvy, right? Sure, you may love to post your thoughts about the big game to Twitter, or tweet out about events and interesting articles. But if you’re trying to grow your business and aren’t seeing the anticipated results, then maybe it’s time to try a Twitter marketing strategy that includes a lead-generation campaign.

Twitter has a number of built-in ways to help you generate leads, plus, with a bit of creativity you can also create your own. Follow these guidelines from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando ad agency</a>, and watch as your business grows through your Twitter-based outreach strategy.
<h3>Try a Promoted Post</h3>
One of the easiest ways to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">generate awareness about your business</a> and services is through a Twitter promoted post. You can set up your promoted post based on users’interests and locations, meaning if you only want to target female college students in the Orlando area, you’re in luck! You can also target users based on the types of people and brands they follow. For example, if you’re in the high-end fashion business, you can target people who follow iconic fashion brands like Vogue and Vanity Fair. Twitter’s <a href=""https://business.twitter.com/solutions/lead-generation-card?lang=en&amp;location=na"">Lead Generation Cards</a> can shorten your conversion path and make it easy to collect <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">potential customers’email addresses</a>.
<h3>Or, Go Organic</h3>
If you don’t have the money to invest in Twitter ads, then you’re going to need to do a little bit more planning to focus on getting leads organically. Luckily, with a little bit of social media listening and some <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">influencer outreach</a>, you can make some major traction just by interacting with the right accounts.

First of all, you’ll need to follow the right people. If you don’t know who the influencers in your space are, go on to Google and do some searches to find out who’s talking about your brand or related brands. Also, on Twitter, search hashtags related to your brand and area of expertise. Spend a little time digging around to see who is connected to whom, and how they interact with one another.

Once you’ve identified these key players in your scene, do some <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">influencer outreach</a>. [quote]Tweet out at them, interact with them, and try to develop those online connections that can result in true relationships.[/quote] While you can’t force someone to retweet you to their hundred thousand followers, you can be funny, uplifting and engaging and hope your followers and influencers play along. And, in doing this, remember that no more than 10% of your business’s tweets should be outright self-promotion.

In using an organic Twitter outreach strategy, it’s important to remember that, especially for people with big followings, Twitter outreach alone won’t be enough to establish the relationships that will help you get your foot in the door. Instead, try <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">tracking down your influencers</a> through LinkedIn or through their blogs to help continue the relationship in a professional manner.

Remember that there’s no one way to use Twitter that’s going to work for every brand, so it’s up to you to learn how to best interact with your followers. Learn about the value you can provide for them, and then take it to the next level by connecting with them on a fundamental level, bonding over they things they’re already talking about on Twitter.

And, if you’re tried all this and still aren’t seeing the results you want, the social media strategists at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a> can help you create a Twitter marketing strategy and outreach plan that gives you the most bang for your buck. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact us</a> today to get the conversation started!",,8/5/2014 8:03,24,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/08/How_to_Generate_Leads_through_Twitter.jpg,generate-leads-using-a-twitter-marketing-strategy,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Transmedia storytelling as an effective theme park marketing strategy,"In a lot of ways, developing an effective theme park marketing strategy evokes quite the “roller coaster” of experiences. There are highs and lows and oftentimes, it even throws you for a loop!

But- it doesn’t have to always be that way, particularly when you have a good sense of what your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> is looking for in its theme park experience. At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our marketing agency in Orlando</a>, we understand that people visit theme parks to be entertained, excited and thrilled, but also to relax and escape everyday life. One of the best ways to get people to choose your park over your competitors’ is to tap into their emotions <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">through emotive storytelling</a>.

This isn’t a story with an introduction, a middle and a conclusion like you might’ve been told in your third grade English class. We’re talking about transmedia storytelling, which describes the art of being able to tap into what people are thinking about, and being able to give them great content and visuals to help inspire them. And, by inspiring potential customers through images of what a great vacation could do for them, you’ll hopefully also be able to inspire them to buy plane tickets to Florida to spend a week at a local resort hotel.

In telling an emotional story, your imagery and words should reflect your commitment to this appeal. A photo of kids laughing on a double decker carousel in LEGOLAND’S Fun Town is going to grab a child’s attention and make them want to escape in the same way. A bullet-point list of facts about your park? Maybe, but think about how much more the photo might resonate with a parent who has a LEGO- obsessed child.

<a href=""https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/"">Disney</a> is a master at this, and <a href=""https://www.universalorlando.com/Home.aspx"">Universal</a> has appeal through its rides inspired by famous favorite films. A perfect example of incorporating media and other immersive storytelling techniques into a marketing strategy is the soon to be newest Universal Water Park- Volcano Bay. Keep your eyes open for this marketing plan, it’s going to be one for the books (get it? Since we’re telling a story? We think we’re funny.)

Unfortunately not every theme park has learned to tap into that universal trigger that keeps people thinking about their experience there through the generations. So if you’re a theme park marketer, one of the most important things you can do is focus on the importance of story in everything that represents your brand. And if you need ideas on how to bring that story to life, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact</a> the expert team at our Orlando ad agency to help you navigate the twists and turns of this exhilarating industry!",,8/6/2014 11:04,26,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Theme-Park-Marketing.jpg,storytelling-as-an-effective-theme-park-marketing-strategy,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"Leveraging LinkedIn for Leadership, and What You Need to Know","If you’re looking to grow your business, one of the best things you can do is to focus on your personal brand. But, if you’re like many people I know, you’re probably asking: where do I begin?

Well, as a leader here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s Florida ad agency, I am committed to staying active in the community, and more importantly, I know that most people in my field and community are on LinkedIn. Right now, <a href=""http://mashable.com/2014/04/18/linkedin-300-million-users/"">300 million people</a> are on LinkedIn, and those people come from 150+ industries and represent more than 3 million companies.

But, as we all know, we don’t tend to get a lot of jobs from LinkedIn alone. Getting jobs and clients is all about networking. Good thing LinkedIn knows that too, and strives to emphasize that the site is not just about trying to help you find a job through it’s electronic database, but is also about helping grow business development opportunities through your personal connections.

Therefore, if you want to solidify yourself as a professional in your space, it’s pertinent to have a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">presence on LinkedIn</a>. But that’s the bare minimum. If you truly want to shine, you can use LinkedIn as part of your personal branding process, using it to display portfolio projects, to help improve your search rankings and to blog about topics related to your business.

For people interested in working with you for the first time, LinkedIn serves as your “elevator pitch” or value proposition. So, it’s important to treat it like one. If you have only a listing of past job titles and a bare minimum profile, you better have an excellent offline reputation or else people won’t know (or care) much about you when they read your profile.

With LinkedIn, the power of the technology is in the scale. If you were once sending newsletters to only your clients, you can now post them to LinkedIn for the world to see. In this way, LinkedIn can be a strong resource for helping you to build visibility in your chosen field. By blogging to LinkedIn, you have a built-in network of people who will see and read your content, which will help to build visibility for you and your business.

If you’re looking to build a strong <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">professional reputation</a> in your space via LinkedIn, make sure you use relevant keywords on your profile so people can find you. You never know when someone might search “hotel expert Orlando.” It’s in your best interest to make sure you’ve populated your LinkedIn profile with the right keywords to ensure your name comes up first.

Also, think about your photo. Does it tell people who you are, or is it just something you Instagrammed two years ago? Getting a professional headshot helps to solidify your place as a pro, and as we all know, first impressions count. Make the best one by presenting your best self in the digital space. But don’t feel like you have a wear a suit in your photo if your job rarely calls for one.

While brevity is important, LinkedIn is a place to highlight your accomplishments. You don’t have to brag, but it is important to build a strong presence by differentiating yourself from the norm. Post those items that impress the people around you. [quote]With all of your hard work, you’ve earned the right to showcase you expertise.[/quote]

If you haven’t been using LinkedIn as a way to convey your personal brand, now is the time. At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we know it is becoming more and more important to make sure that your digital footprint reflects your capabilities. Luckily, LinkedIn lets you be in control of that. So put it all up there: classes, past speaking engagements, Keynote decks, accomplishments and thought leadership blogs, and make sure that your online elevator pitch is the kind that makes people want to stay with you on that elevator - because they know it’s headed directly to the top.",,8/13/2014 13:03,26,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LinkedIn-to-Leadership.jpg,leveraging-linkedin-for-leadership,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

The Right Questions to Ask in Restaurant Marketing,"It’s not uncommon for restaurant marketers to reach out to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> for tips on how to effectively market their concepts. It would be great if the key to successful restaurant marketing meant there was a to-do list of items that, upon completion, would cause a genie to pop out of a bottle, and your wish for guaranteed success be granted. But unfortunately, the ideal strategy is much more complicated than that…

There’s no one-size-fits-all marketing plan that will work for every restaurant. A high-end restaurant that caters to tourists won’t necessarily have the same marketing strategy as a diner where all the locals hang out on the weekends. It’s important to identify your target audience, industry challenges, and what your potential customers want. Only then can you identify the right ways to reach them.

Often times, if the number of people coming to your restaurant drops off drastically, it could mean there is something about the experience that’s causing you to lose out to competitors. In some cases, it might just need a little bit of refining, while in others it could mean spell the need to make a major pivot (for instance, offering healthier options, as fast food restaurants <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/business/mcdonalds-moves-toward-a-healthier-menu.html"">have done in the past</a>.)

If you want to know what your customers want, there’s no better way to do this than by talking to them. Personally, I feel flattered when a chef comes out of the back just to say hello and ask me about my dining experience. A place that does something like that makes me feel appreciated, and is sure to keep me coming back again. But beyond that, keep the conversation going. [quote]Identify your regulars, follow them on Twitter, and engage with them to hear their thoughts and suggestions.[/quote] Sometimes, it’s less about doing the PR-worthy stunts to get people in the door, and more about listening to the feedback to perfect the restaurant experience as a whole.

One great place to find out what people are saying about your business is <a href=""http://yelp.com"">Yelp</a>. If you haven’t been on Yelp lately and are wondering if there might be something keeping people from your restaurant, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> advises you to look at the Yelp reviews. Admittedly, people are not afraid to say why they didn’t enjoy an experience, especially when they’re on the Internet, under the dark veil of pseudo-anonymity. With that said, you may want to take the reviews with a grain of salt (after all, reviewers aren’t typically food experts but just average people who may not know much about your cuisine). On the other hand, if 100 people have rated your restaurant with a single star, it may be time to rethink the experience.

In switching the question from “What can we do to get customers?” to “What do our customers want?"" you shift the focus to the needs of the people who are going to support your business. Understanding your target audience can help you find new ways to reach them. Maybe the reason they’re not going crazy for “all-you-can-eat wing night” is because they’re more interested in getting a perfect gluten-free veggie burger. Your potential customers won’t respond when you try to tell them what to do, but they will take action when you make a concentrated effort to give them the experience they deserve.

What a Bargain! Successful Strategies for Marketing to Parents,"Parents are always looking for ways to save money. If you have kids of your own, you know just how expensive it can be to feed, clothe and entertain an 8-year-old ball of energy. In fact, <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/the-cost-of-raising-a-baby""><em>Parenting Magazine </em></a>says the average child costs about $15,000 a year (and that doesn’t even include extras like private school tuition or ski lessons.) And, as a marketer, it’s important to consider these variable costs when you’re trying to reach their parents. Parents have to think ahead to be able to save for college tuition, for rainy day activities and for unexpected circumstances.

This is why most parents, like myself, will find themselves attracted to things that will save them money. Wholesalers like Costo and Sam’s Club do extremely well with their model of selling bulk goods at wholesale prices because people just can’t pass up a good bargain. You can buy a month’s worth of paper towels for a family of five in a single trip to Costco, and pay far less than you would for it had you gone to a local drugstore.

In marketing to parents, it’s important to consider their needs and think about the things that really affect their lives. The good news is that parents always need ways to entertain their children. They also desire to provide fun and interesting educational experiences to children, ways to give them new ways to think about the world and nurture their interests. And, when there’s a deal tied to a way to do that, it often sets forth a psychological signal that encourages the parents to buy.

Even when the deal isn’t necessarily that much better than the actual price, sometimes just seeing that you can get a free soft drink with a purchase inspires you to go for the deal. This is why the coupon special at Chuck-E-Cheese can get people through the door and, in many cases, cause them to spend even more than they would have if they had gone there without a coupon. Something about the terms “20% off” or “Buy One Get One” send a signal that the parent is getting more bang for his buck, even if it’s a product the parent wasn’t planning to purchase in the first place. (Of course, if you do experiment with coupons, be sure to integrate testing mechanisms to see which types of deals perform better with your customers.)

Psychologists know that material things will only last so long, but that the experiences that parents can give their children can stay with them for their lives. But often it becomes a financial issue, or at least a perceived one, that they can’t afford a vacation they wanted to take or go to an <a href=""http://www.amwaycenter.com/events/orlando-magic"">Orlando Magic</a> game. Of course, in attaching a deal to that, it suddenly makes the excursion appear to be more affordable.

If you need more ideas to help connect with parents using a deal marketing approach, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact</a> the team at our Florida advertising agency, and we’ll give you the information you need to offer great strategies to reach parents that are cost-effective to both you and the parents you aim to reach.",,8/21/2014 9:29,20,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Parents-Love-a-Bargain.jpg,successful-strategies-for-marketing-to-parents,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Resort Marketing & Community Management: The ins and outs,"For resort marketers, community management can present challenges unique to the industry. A high-end resort has different needs than, say, a massive chain of budget hotels, and as such it’s important to understand the “lay of the land” to reach the correct audience.

While there is no one right way to accomplish this feat, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Florida advertising agency</a> has learned some best practices over the years to increase the reach of your resort.

Here are a few tips to help get you started:
<h3>1. Know Your Target Audience</h3>
Is your resort a “lover’s paradise” or a “family getaway?” Knowing the types of people who would ideally want to stay at your property is the first step to honing your community management efforts, and in turn, ensuring that you’re reaching the right people. Think about this in terms of “pain and gain” - what are people lacking in their lives, and how can your resort help fill that void? Also, tap into what’s happening in the local landscape…I recently learned of a resort that changed some of its marketing practices once it realized that the area was a hotbed for people who enjoyed wind sports like kite boarding and parasailing.
<h3>2. Do a Social Media Listening Study</h3>
In an era when people so freely volunteer information about their lives, it’s a shame how many marketers fail to tap into this free information to help glean insights about their business. There are numerous tools available for social media listening, but even if you don’t have a big budget, you can look to tools such as <a href=""http://socialmention.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Social Mention</a> and <a href=""http://hootsuite.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hootsuite</a> to find out about brand sentiment and figure out what people are saying about your resort.[quote]If you think that simply setting Google alerts and paying attention to your retweets and Facebook comments is enough to learn about your audience, you might be surprised.[/quote] Many social media tools are equipped to uncover much more valuable information like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">audience demographics</a>, plus these tools can reach lesser-used sites like Flickr and Digg.
<h3>3. Figure Out Who Your Influencers Are, and Reach Out to Them</h3>
If you’ve been a resort marketer for a while, you probably know that there’s no marketing tool as good as that of a happy visitor. Typically, when people have a great experience, they share it on social media and through word of mouth with friends. By identifying influencers, you can find ways to reach out to them, such as by retweeting their photos and engaging with them. Remember, an influencer doesn't necessarily mean someone who has a lot of followers - a better influencer is an individual with their own ultra-engaged network. Figure out who your brand’s biggest influencers are using tools such as <a href=""https://fitsmallbusiness.com/reviews/social-media-management-software-reviews/#graveyard"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Klout</a> and <a href=""http://followerwonk.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FollowerWonk</a>. Make sure to follow them and engage with them on social channels.
<h3>4. Post Sharable Content</h3>
As a resort marketer, you’re in a lucky space because you have significant access to imagery that can help entice people to visit your resort. Sharing these visuals can help plant the seeds to help people make the decision to make a reservation at your property. The reality is that in this day and age, even if your potential customers aren’t necessarily following you on Facebook or Twitter, they will check your Facebook page before booking to gain greater insight —no one wants to pay a lot of money to stay at a subpar resort! Having a good webpage, a high number of positive TripAdvisor reviews, and tons of imagery on your social sites are some of the best ways to entice people to stay at your resort on an upcoming vacation.

Business is Great! What Are the Benefits of Advertising?,"Working in the field of advertising and marketing, I often come across people who don’t understand the benefits of advertising. “Business is great,” they tell me. “So why should I continue to pay money to push out ads when I could be spending money elsewhere?”

You probably already know that the main point of advertising is to obtain-and-retain customers that will spend money with your business. But, assuming you’re a law firm, a consultant, or an ecommerce retailer who does most of your business through word-of-mouth networking and referrals, you may find yourself questioning whether your market budget could be better allocated elsewhere. The same people will tell me that since business is fine, there’s no need to waste money by pushing to get more. Oh, if only that were the case.

If we were to rely on that kind of logic, then you wouldn’t see daily ads from the nation’s biggest brands such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, or <a href=""http://disney.com"">Disney</a>. [quote]Business is booming at these companies, and yet they still spend millions of dollars each year to remain in the public’s consciousness.[/quote] So, if business is generating high profits and you’re wondering whether your ad budget should be spent elsewhere, the team at our Florida advertising agency wants you to consider the following:

<strong>Are You Concerned With the Possibility of Market Share Erosion? </strong>If you’re not advertising and your competitors are, then don’t be surprised if your potential customers choose the company that keeps advertising its lower fees and better results.

<strong>Are You Satisfied with the Market Itself? </strong>By not advertising, you could be implying that you have little concern that others are offering better services and better deals. This is a sure way to lose out to your competitors.

<strong>Do You Worry About Losing Touch With Potential New Customers? </strong>If you’ve been in business for a while and aren’t advertising, then you must consider how you going to rebuild your customer base when your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> outgrows your business or service? By advertising, you can continue the cycle of trying to reach new customers without having to scramble once it’s too late.

<strong>Does it Bother You that People May Forget About Your Business?</strong> People forget quickly, especially in this age of social media. The more advertising and marketing touch points you have in place to actively engage with potential customers, the higher the likelihood of making these people convert. This is precisely why ad <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">remarketing and site retargeting</a> work so well.

<strong>How Do You Feel About Losing Your Existing Customers? </strong>The more you can be a part of peoples’ daily lives, the more they’re going to continue to come back to you. This is why advertising, social media, email marketing and direct mail are such effective methods of retaining customers. They have to remember you to want to select you, and when they don’t remember you, that’s when you lose them.

Know The Top Tips for Financial Institution Marketing,"With so many tools, webinars and publications available for marketers within the financial services industry, it's often difficult to sift through the clutter to figure out the most “essential” strategies for bank marketing success. However, some strategies do stand above others, and these tried-and-tested outreach methodologies can create sizable success within your financial institution. That’s why <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE’s Florida marketing agency</a> is offering a few highly effective tips to help increase your bank or other financial service’s ROI.
<h3>Develop a Strategy Prioritization Matrix</h3>
The first step to success in the financial realm is prioritization. A Strategy Prioritization Matrix can help you to determine the most strategic projects to help your business get the most “bang for its buck.” Create the matrix by listing the impact on the X axis (high or low) and the ease of implementation on the Y axis (hard or easy). Then, within the matrix, classify potential projects in one of four buckets: Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort), Must Haves (High Impact, High Effort), Low-Hanging Fruit (Low Impact, Low Effort) and Money Pits (Low Impact, High Effort). Your matrix might look something like this:

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-8.57.20-AM.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-6686"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-8.57.20-AM.png"" alt=""Strategy Prioritization Matrix"" width=""477"" height=""393"" /></a>

This will help clarify those areas requiring the greatest focus. For most banks and credit unions, the Quick Wins will be of highest priority, as the ROI impact is highest, and the strategy is easy to implement.
<h3>Implement a “New Mover” Customer Acquisition Strategy</h3>
Prospective clients that may be relocating to your area will likely be in search of a local bank. Depending on a potential customer’s degree of wealth, he or she may also need other financial planning services such as estate planning or wealth management. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">Creating a strategy to deliver your message</a> into prospect’s inbox will assist in the growth of your audience. Of course a direct mail customer outreach campaign is only portion of the process. It’s important to have a strategy in place to ensure that yours is the first financial services company to reach these potential clients, including the development of efficient on-boarding processes. For many financial service providers, these outreach efforts can prove to be “Quick Win,” as outlined in the matrix above.
<h3>Invest in Digital Retargeting</h3>
According to <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//team/"">Wagner dos Santos</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s senior director of marketing and strategic planning, retargeting is often the most effective and efficient acquisition strategy on a cost-per-account basis. It’s also a good way to capitalize on a person’s interest, as retargeting is only triggered after a person visits your site or clicks on your content.

In many ways, digital retargeting can successfully work in tandem with direct mail efforts, as one banking business achieved a lift of 40% after pairing digital retargeting efforts with a direct mail campaign.
<h3>Collect Insights for Iterative Improvement</h3>
[quote]<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">Email marketing</a> is still one of the leading ways to reach people, even in spite of significant levels of email glut.[/quote] When your business can tailor communications to send the right message to the right individuals through segmentation, it significantly improves the chances that the prospect will convert (as compared to a general email blast). Be sure that in all financial services relationships, you’re not only collecting email addresses, but also <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">analyzing customer profiles</a> so that you can provide information that is relevant to their individual banking and financial needs. Through surveys and new account processing, you can grab significant information about your customers that you can then use for future marketing and outreach efforts. And, through iteration, you can continue evolving your campaigns and strategies for optimal growth.

12 Steps to Social Media Marketing Success Infographic,"<strong>12 Steps to Social Media Marketing</strong>

By Lindsay Berry Posted on September 9, 2014

&nbsp;

1. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">Research</a> and know your audience! What topics and interests are they most social about?

2. Only choose to utilize the networks and platforms that best speak to your audience.

3. State your key performance indicators (KPIs). What do you want your social efforts to accomplish? What does success look like in quantifiable terms?

4. Write a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketing playbook</a>. The playbook should detail your KPIs, audience profiles, brand personas, campaign concepts, promotional events, contests, content themes, crisis management steps, etc. Note that the strategy should be unique to each platform.

5. Align the members of your company around the plan. Assign responsibilities as to who is posting, who is responding, and who is reporting metrics.

6. Take 30-60 minutes at the beginning of each week or month to schedule tweets, Facebook posts, LinkedIn posts, pins, or other <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media content</a>. These can be original ideas, links to your own work, or links to outside content that may be useful or of interest to your audience.

7. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Create a content bank</a> using a spreadsheet and plan out the content topics, headlines, related links, desired scheduling, name of authors, and an area for management approval on every line.

8. Post relevant content relating to newsworthy topics and events in a timely manner. It’s important to share opinions as soon as breaking news happens.

9. Treat all social channels separately. You shouldn’t be posting the same message across all channels - remember who the audience is behind each platform.

10. Assign someone to act as a customer service rep to be responsive to user generated content and negativity. Don’t ignore comments and feedback.

11. Schedule reporting! Depending on your goals, reporting metrics can occur weekly, monthly, or biannually.

12. Reanalyze your plan on a regular basis. If something in your plan isn't working, switch it up or A/B test content to determine what your audience responds to better.",,9/9/2014 12:03,3,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/12-Steps-to-Social-Media-Marketing-Success-Infographic.jpg,12-steps-to-social-media-marketing-success-infographic,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

5 SEO Mistakes that are Costing Your Business Money,"If you’ve been in the digital marketing world for any length of time, you’ve probably heard the term “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>”. If not, it stands for Search Engine Optimization, and it describes a subset of digital marketing and development that emphasizes keywords, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">website design</a>, linking and other tactics to help gain traction in search engine rankings, and ultimately, result in conversions. This is important because people around the world conduct millions of searches a day, and if your business is the top rank for a particular keyword, then that simple placement on Google’s search engine can earn you thousands or even millions of dollars in additional income.

While the concept of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> is fairly easy to understand, mastering search engine rankings and conversions is another story. Google wants the most relevant sites to come up first in rankings and uses a complex algorithm to make sure this is the case. At the same time, companies who want to secure coveted positions can implement website optimization tactics to their websites to secure top rankings that lead to conversions. As a result, companies turn to search engine optimization for help in implementing a strategic approach to both <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> and conversion optimization.

Unfortunately, we see far too many businesses executing incorrectly, and succumbing to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> mistakes. Here are a few things that can harm your SEO rankings, compiled by the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at your favorite Orlando SEO agency</a>:
<h3>1. Not Having a Web Page</h3>
This is a rather obvious one, but when companies have no digital footprint, potential customers on the web have no way of finding them. While in this day and age, it seems like every business you can think of has a webpage, you might be surprised at the number of businesses that solely rely on sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor as the only means of being found online - leaving these businesses virtually invisible to the Google-searching masses.

<h3>2. Paying for Cheap Services</h3>
Inexpensive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO services</a> may actually cause more harm than hurt. Many times, businesses try to “cheat” and end up outsourcing website <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriting</a> assignments to foreign agencies that produce keyword heavy content in broken English. In theory, the notion that the copy is keyword-heavy would produce strong results, but Google’s algorithm is trained to recognize keyword density above a certain level. As a result, businesses are penalized for attempting to employ outrightly obvious SEO boosting tactics. Remember that Google wants to provide the most relevant results, not necessarily the most keyword heavy ones. Therefore, sites that rely on inexpensive services may end up at the bottom.
<h3>3. Bad Keyword Research</h3>
If you’re in a business that’s highly competitive in the SEO field, you’ll have little chance of competing with companies that have years of SEO experience and are major players in the space. A better tactic is to focus on more narrow keyword searches, but not so narrow people can’t find you. Developing a strategic course of action takes time and effort, but a great place is <a href=""https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Google’s AdWords Keyword Planner</a>. You may find you need to stay away from high volume searches due to stiff competition. Instead, you can hone in on more specific searches that don’t get as much volume, but are more targeted toward your business offerings.
<h3>4. Link Exchanges / Spam Links / Paid Links in Content / Other Shady Linking Tactics</h3>
Google gives a fair amount of credit to legitimate links included in blog posts, but if you’re engaging in shady linking practices, you might have a problem. [quote]There is a multitude of ways people try to manipulate links, but if you think you’re smarter than Google, guess again.[/quote] If, for example, you’re using low-quality blog networks to try to increase ranking in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>, or are inserting paid links in your content, then you’d better be ready to watch your search engine ranking drop dramatically. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> experts know that Google doesn’t allow companies to recover from this practice easily, and that it can take years to regain ranking if Google’s algorithm flags you for using shady linking practices.
<h3>5. Not Keeping Apprised of Updates and Best Practices</h3>
Google is constantly updating its algorithm to help combat shady SEO tactics. Even if you’re someone who’s simply dabbling in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>, it’s important to be up-to-date with the most current SEO ranking trends and practices. A great resource to figure out whether your SEO needs a refresh is <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Google’s Webmaster Rules</a>.

Learn the Keys to Attracting Customers - Great Ones,"Interestingly, when businesses contact <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, they have a pressing issue: Business is steady, but they’re often frustrated with the client base itself.  Whether it’s the salon clients who don’t tip, the hotel guest who always complains so she can get a free upgrade or the consulting client who rarely pays on time, there is a common refrain – how do you attract and retain the best customers?

It’s no misnomer that if you don’t diligently focus your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">branding and marketing efforts</a> on finding good customers, you may end up with too many of the wrong type of customers. In addition to simply being a headache to you, the wrong type of customer may actually dilute the value of your business as a whole.

Let’s talk about the “daily deals” industry, for instance. These limited-time offer sites capitalize on deal seekers, people who purchase tickets for a dinner or excursion that they may not have purchased without a special incentive. (In most cases, the opportunity for consumers is to pay less than full price.)

The “daily deal” strategy works well for some businesses, as they may promote deals often because it’s what their target market loves. Big retailers such as <a href=""http://walmart.com"">Walmart</a> and <a href=""http://jcpenny.com"">JCPenny</a> both keep their customers returning by offering low prices and sales on everyday products.

But the problem with some of these deal sites is that the deal-seeking customer can be detrimental for businesses in search of long-term clients rather than a one-off visitor. The person who comes in using a <a href=""http://groupon.com"">Groupon</a> may not have much interest in returning to the restaurant, unless he or she can get another offer. In this example, the deal seeker just paid half-price for a meal, and may have done so with no intention of returning or spreading the word to other potential diners.

In applying the “deal strategy” on a larger scale, you’ll notice all kinds of problematic customers. These are the types of people who shop in department stores for fancy dresses, wear them out for a night on the town, and then return them the next day (yes, people really do that!). Or, they might be the people who come into your restaurant and complain during every visit until their meals are comped. While it’s important to provide a great experience in hopes that customers engage in positive word-of-mouth marketing, it’s also necessary to consider whether your marketing efforts are attracting these “Debbie Downers”…and if so, how to change course.

When evaluating whether you’re working with the right types of customers, focus on the 80/20 rule, which suggests that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Essentially, this means that for many businesses, [quote]80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients[/quote] 80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients. The goal here should be to focus on the tactical strategies that drive that 80% of sales, rather than exhausting yourself trying to please those customers whose purchasing power makes up only 20%.

"Venturing Beyond the Fold in Web Design, Exploring New Designs","It’s time to have the talk- yes,<em> the</em> talk about scrolling. Everyone does it. You do it. We do it. Your grandmother does it. We all scroll through web pages- especially if we love the content. One of the biggest concerns brands have regarding their website is content exposure. The big question is, “Are visitors scrolling through my website or just glancing above the fold?”
<h3>Scrolling is Habitual</h3>
Today, scrolling down web pages is second nature to many computer users. [quote] Apple felt so confident in this statement that they removed the scrollbar from their recent Mac OSX update.[/quote] Scrolling plays a key role across all social media platforms. The <a href=""http://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">1.82 billion</a> social users prefer to expose themselves to more and more content by scrolling through feeds. Sites that have parallax scrolling features have the cleanest conversions in terms of usability across desktop and mobile platforms.
<h3>Exploring Below the Fold</h3>
Back in the golden age of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print media</a>, newspapers would be folded in half on newsstands, and the top half was designated for the juiciest news to a grab reader’s attention and the same goes for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">websites</a>. The information you want your audience to see should be placed at the top of the page, but it is important to follow certain design principles to keep visitors intrigued to keep scrolling for more. Major brand website’s like that of <a href=""http://uk.burberry.com/my-burberry/#inspiration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Burberry</a> have less content above the fold to encourage users to venture beyond the fold by use of its alluring hero image. <a href=""http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/cxblog/the_myth_of_the_page_fold_evidence_from_user_testing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CX Parners </a>notes: “ The screens show two different design treatments for the hero slot on the homepage. The surprising thing we have learnt was that actually having less above the fold (one large content block as opposed to 2 smaller ones) encouraged exploration below the fold.”
<h3>Less is More</h3>
Adopting a cleaner and simpler style, such as parallax scrolling, will not only make your website better-looking, but it will also assist in positioning your brand as modern, up-to-date, and innovative. If users visit your site and are curious in the content you have above the fold, they will scroll away. However, to ensure website visitors are doing what you want them to do, be sure to <a href=""http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/cxblog/the_myth_of_the_page_fold_evidence_from_user_testing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">follow design principles</a> including less is more, avoid horizontal lines, and avoid in-page scroll bars.

How the Apple Watch Could Impact Marketing Efforts,"Like tech geeks everywhere, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at BIGEYE’s Orlando advertising agency</a> was thrilled to hear about Apple’s latest innovation, the Apple Watch. Just like many moons ago when cellphones were limited to just calling one another, watches that simply tell time may be a thing of the past.

But what is the implication of the <a href=""https://www.apple.com/watch/"">Apple Watch</a> for marketers? We’ve always been advocates of the possibilities of “wearable tech,” but we think the Apple Watch is going to open up a new world of applications that marketers can leverage to help engage with their customers.

The most amazing-and likely the most impactful-features that make up the Apple Watch are its ability to display social media updates, run simplified apps and access Siri. Marketing companies can find ways to leverage the Apple Watch as a tool to generate more customer touch points through customized apps and via integration with mobile technology. For instance, athletic companies may be able to use the Apple Watch to help users monitor both heart rates and fitness activities. Companies like <a href=""http://www.fitbit.com"">FitBit</a> and Nike’s Fuelband helped create this type of interactive wear, but with a seamless integration to Apple’s iPhone, the target audience for this technology is much broader. As a result, it will now be easier than ever to share this health information with an even larger demographic. In doing so, companies can also collect data about users’ activities to help target nutrition ads, gym deals and other special offers, directly to their watches.

Another interesting aspect of the Apple Watch is its projected ability to revolutionize mobile payments. While this technology has been in play for quite some time (think Google Wallet), historically, it seems that when Apple adopts technology, it then becomes an industry standard. Simplified mobile payments will undoubtedly make it even easier for people to make purchases in both brick-and-mortar stores and via online channels. The technology tips its hat to Eastern countries such as China and Japan, where payments made directly from mobile devices is the norm. The West has been slow to adopt this technology, but with the new Apple Watch, there are more opportunities for watch payments to revolutionize the way people conduct transactions. This is great for marketers, because as we all know, the less cumbersome the steps in the purchasing process, the more likely the end result will be a sale.

[quote]Although we don’t yet know everything about the possibilities in the world of smart watches, we do know that this type of technology can change the way we communicate with one another.[/quote] As many people have begun communicating using visual expressions-such as emojis and Snapchat-rather than written expressions, the Apple Watch can make messages of the visual-type even easier to exchange than sending a text or email from your cell. As a result, we anticipate that communication will become even simpler than it already is. In fact, Apple’s Watches will even have a vibration feature that allows you to get someone else’s attention by sending them a vibration that no one else can hear. And, if you can get a friend’s attention with just a simple vibrate, then think of how an advertiser might be able to attract the attention of a broad audience with just one interaction!

The Apple Watch won’t eliminate the need for iPhones. In fact, it is reliant on owning an iPhone to use it. But, what it will do is provide even more opportunities for marketers to become part of their customers’ everyday lives.

By finding intelligent ways to leverage Apple Watch technology, marketers will remain at the forefront of innovation.

The Guide To The Social Media Management Juggernaut,"There’s an old episode of the hit television show <em>The Office</em> where the now infamous boss, Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell), hires his nephew to work for <a href=""http://www.dundermifflin.com"">Dunder Mifflin Paper Company</a>. Rather than providing any sort of value to the company and the employees therein, Scott’s nephew becomes a burden, creating more problems than he solves. Between his lack of experience and lack of competency, he’s simply not qualified for the position.

When I hear that a business owner has hired a nephew, or a cousin, or a family friend to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">run social media</a> for the company, I think of this episode. Sure, it seems like a good idea -- where else are you going to find such cheap labor? And, if people as young as 10 are on social media, how hard can it be? Well, that’s a lot like saying that anyone who owns a television set should write for TV. The reality is that knowing social media and understanding how it can impact your marketing efforts takes passion, commitment, and most importantly, an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">educated strategy</a>.

First, assessing a candidate to implement your social media program starts with the knowledge that even people who use these platforms on a daily basis may not posses a complete understanding. For instance, people who have been on social media since 2005 are likely to have never used a Facebook brand page, purchased an ad on LinkedIn or built-up a 10,000 person following on Twitter.

In many cases, and much like that fateful episode of <em>The Office</em>, hiring an inexperienced person to do your social media management may cause more harm than good. [quote]Your novice <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media manager</a> could be so focused on getting “likes” and shares that he or she employs methods that are actually detrimental to building a loyal audience within your target market.[/quote] For example, I’ve seen people buy “likes” and use shady Facebook Ad strategies to drive traffic to their sites, only to find that these inflated follower counts are full of people who really don’t care about your product and aren’t interested in engaging.

Also, when it comes to social media, there’s the lingering question of legal issues. For instance, many people don’t know that according to rules defined by many social networking sites, brands running contests are obligated to use specific language and provide contest rules to ensure they’re not misleading the public (that’s the “no purchase necessary” language you hear in most sweepstakes offers). Companies that skimp on engaging a professional to do this type of work for them on social media put themselves at risk of lawsuits when they hire people who aren’t trained in these matters.

Even those users who have large followings and a strong understanding of social media don’t necessarily know about tracking metrics. And, likely can’t tell you how to use social media listening tools like <a href=""https://engagor.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Engagor</a>, <a href=""http://www.socialmention.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SocialMention</a> and FollowerWonk to increase engagement. As you can see, there’s a lot more to running successful social media than just posting a photo to Facebook or writing a funny caption that your two best friends “like.”

Across the board, most businesses will benefit from working with seasoned professionals who know and fully understand audience engagement. If you are considering hiring a family member or friend to run social media for your business, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando advertising agency</a> wants you to be sure you ask them the right questions to ensure they’re qualified. Remember that social media is, at its core, a strategy for developing trusted relationships with your audience. Leaving this in the hands of your nephew is, put quite simply, a “Michael Scott mistake.”",,9/30/2014 12:47,3,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Why-You-Shouldn’t-Leave-Your-Business’s-Social-Media-to-Your-Nephew.jpg,the-social-media-management-juggernaut,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Does the Need Still Exist for Brick-and-Mortar Banks?,"Living in a digital age, we are privy to the technological shifts that are occurring on an everyday basis. Almost everything we do requires some assistance from high-powered technology, including handling our finances. The days of the brick-and-mortar bank location seem to be numbered, with many banking locations shutting down in favor of investing more resources to reach people digitally.

From a financial perspective, it makes sense. After all, it’s far more efficient to have your clientele handle all their banking needs online, eliminating the need for tellers and associates who are expensive to hire and retain. And, it’s much more convenient for your customer to obtain all of the services she needs through a few swipes on a smartphone app, rather than having to visit a bank each time she wants to know her account balance. With these factors in mind, the shift toward digital is a win-win for both banks and their customers.

It’s impossible to say whether digitization will ever eliminate the need for brick-and-mortar banks completely, but there are some financial services institutions “banking” on this trend. There are dozens of online-only banks, which operate entirely in the digital realm. Many of them offer exactly the same features as traditional brick-and-mortar banks, with the only exception being that there’s no physical location to visit to obtain information and make deposits.

For instance, <a href=""http://www.ally.com/?CP=ppc110188"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ally</a> boasts that it too, has no brick-and-mortar locations, which means less bank overhead and fewer staff to pay - and even going so far as to pay customers’ ATM fees to remain competitive. Moven also embraces the idea of online-only banking, but supplements it with budgeting tools similar to those that <a href=""http://mint.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mint</a> offers. And, <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/profiles-strategies/2014/08/customers-bancorp-is-betting-big-on-mobile-banking.html?page=all"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">according to The Business Journals</a>, BankMobile aspires to become a mobile-only bank, allowing users to do anything via their smartphone device that they could do in person, including applying for a loan or mortgage.

It’s no surprise that banks are embracing this technology, given a <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/08/07/51-of-u-s-adults-bank-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent Pew Internet report</a> that says [quote]51% of all American adults bank online[/quote] 51% of all American adults bank online. And, according to the same article, 32% of all U.S. adults (or 35% of all cell phone owners) bank using their mobile phones. As smartphone use becomes even more widespread, it’s likely that this number will continue to increase, especially as long as banks continue to make an effort to phase out dated technologies.

So, what’s the takeaway from all of this? Banks need careful monitoring their customers’ digital activities so that they do not fall behind the times in terms of service offerings. A bank that’s just now launching a responsive website, an easy-to-use app for both iOS and Andriod, and a mobile check deposit feature is simply playing catch-up, which becomes a real weakness on the competitive landscape. Also, bank marketers who don’t seriously consider that the future of banking will likely require a mobile-first strategy and the potential eradication of physical credit cards and debit cards need to understand how rapidly technology is changing the way we do our banking.

Using this information, banks can work with their development teams to introduce technical strategies to be better equipped to customers’ needs, both online and offline. Doing so may also result in identifying supplementary marketing strategies to specifically target customers on their phones and computers, or that introduce user-friendly budgeting tools to effectively reach their clients, thus increasing the number of consumer touch points.

Create A Winning Content Strategy For Your Business,"In an era of never-ending content, it’s hard for companies to compete without numerous audience touch points to help generate interest in their business. However, some of the top businesses have learned to navigate this digital terrain effectively by emphasizing content. Think of sites as varied as <a href=""http://linkedin.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=""http://buzzfeed.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">BuzzFeed</a> and <a href=""http://moz.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Moz</a>. The marketers at each of these sites have learned to leverage content in order to become leaders in their respective fields.

At our advertising agency, we believe that well-developed content strategy is one of the most effective ways to improve your business’s reach. Even better, according to <a href=""http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/B2B_Research_2014_CMI.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2014 B2B Content Marketing Trends—North America</a> from the <a href=""http://contentmarketinginstitute.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Content Marketing Institute</a>, 86% of businesses with effective content marketing strategies claim that having someone who oversees those strategies is one of the best ways to help produce relevant content.

[quote]If you are thinking of developing a content strategy, doing your homework is a great place to start.[/quote] Once you identify the best channels, you can then create an editorial calendar. An editorial calendar helps you keep track of big promotions and the types of content you want to create. Vertical Horizons offers an excellent <a href=""http://www.verticalmeasures.com/content-editorial-calendar-template/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">free content calendar template</a> to help you develop your strategy.

In planning your content calendar, it’s important to take in holidays, seasons and events. Historic dates are also fun ways to generate content, and being flexible in terms of what that means can help open doors to a ton of fun content ideas. For inspiration, think about the way Google does doodles on its homepage for interesting historical dates.

Lists, current events topics, tutorials and expert interviews tend to be popular content formats. Videos are also consistently gaining popularity, and how-to videos and tutorials tend to be easy for people to consume information, plus they are more sharable. Assess each of these types of content and think about how they might impact your content goals.

For companies that decide <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media should be part of the content strategy</a>, it’s important to understand the social media landscape. Many businesses begin Tweeting and Facebooking without a real strategy, and as such, they may fail to see the value in investing in content creation and curation.

On Twitter, tweets with images tend to get the best responses as measured by engagement. Additionally, asking for retweets by offering a catchy hook works due to the clear call to action. Links should appear 25% of the way through a post, and links should be shared slowly on Twitter so people don’t get the sense that you’re spamming their feeds. Tools like <a href=""http://hootsuite.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">HootSuite</a> and <a href=""http://klout.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Klout</a> can help you schedule and manage these tweets.

If Facebook is part of your content strategy, short videos do well. Brands using Pinterest to help promote their brands can use images, but can also allow visual tutorials. Some companies have created really interesting Pinterest campaigns, such as this <a href=""http://www.pinterest.com/thankyoumum/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Procter and Gamble campaign</a> which features content from athletes thanking their mothers. <a href=""http://instagram.com"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""http://vine.co"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Vine</a> and <a href=""http://snapchat.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Snapchat</a> may also be great networks for heavily visual brands.

<a href=""http://linkedin.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LinkedIn</a> is best for B2B content, as nearly half of all B2B companies use LinkedIn. As part of your social media strategy, you can spend some time answering questions in LinkedIn groups.

As far as blogging, blogs that post multiple posts per day get the most success across the board; however, it is very hard to sustain that momentum, as it typically takes a team of writers. If you want to invest in a good blog strategy but do not have the resources to hire someone full-time, consider hiring a freelancer. You can find numerous people looking for writing work at <a href=""http://elance.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eLance</a> and <a href=""http://odesk.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Odesk</a>. Some of these freelancers may be qualified to help you in creating the strategy and in publishing content for social media as well.

Online Reputation Management In the Banking Industry,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Social media</a> is an important channel of interactive, two-way messaging for many industries, and banking and financial institutions stand to greatly benefit from using this medium to help distribute information. Although social media outlets provide opportunities for banks to engage with current and potential customers, there are also obstacles that banks must overcome to implement a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">successful social media strategy</a>. One of the most complex issues facing financial institutions in this realm is that of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">online reputation management</a>.

While some banks seem to be behind the times when it comes to adopting social media and new technologies, it is not always because of a lack of desire to integrate them. Rather, these financial instructions face a number of challenges in the area of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">digital reputation management</a>, namely in facilitating a large volume of comments – and not all of them positive.

One major challenge in managing the client feedback issue is the allocation of resources dedicated to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media management</a>. Limited resources pose an even greater challenge to a company that has so many client-facing interactions in touchy circumstances. For instance, a person who has just learned that his bank has foreclosed on his home might direct his angry tirade at the financial institution. This situation has the potential to lead to a very public outburst on social media. This customer service orientation skews the purpose of instituting a successful social media program.

Even in cases where banks might have the allocated resources to maintain control of customer relationships via social media, another threat to implementation of a successful program pertains to federal and state regulation. In this regard, there are numerous stipulations in place as to what can, and what cannot, be done on social media. In fact, it’s so highly regulated, that in some financial service industries, these companies are forbidden from “liking” others’ content, as it may be considered an endorsement. Along the same lines, in some cases banks cannot “share” content unless it has been vetted for regulatory purposes by a professional association. [quote]With so many legal and regulatory mandates in place to how <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media managers</a> may address certain issues, these efforts can become more complicated than in other industries.[/quote]

Luckily, banks are not without options. For instance, they can implement social media listening to help inform them of customer service issues before they become larger, unmanageable issues. One approach is to integrate a plan that encourages positive feedback and reviews, which has potential to catch fire and become contagious among the audience.

In fact, the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE’s Orlando marketing agency</a> has significant experience in working with financial institutions to help develop their social media marketing campaigns, incorporating strategies for digital reputation management as a component of the plan. Through ongoing digital research and strategic planning, we can help your bank address these needs to implement a successful social media initiative, while keeping in mind resource management to implement cost-effective solutions.

Optimizing Your Website Experience for Conversions,"A client I once worked with offered a series of language classes for a relatively low rate, yet the business had an extremely low conversion rate relative to the number of people who visited the site. This was one of the most affordable language programs in town, but conversion rates were at a dismal 4%. He came to me for help in pinpointing why so many people who visited the site would leave before “converting” or in layman’s terms “purchasing classes.”

When I audited his website, I discovered that there were no fewer than seven steps in the conversion process. And, that didn’t count the third-party payment system in place, which had a defective user experience as well.

Since the language classes were a primary source of revenue, I suggested simplifying the checkout process. By making it super simple to go from the homepage to the checkout page, visitors would be more likely to do just that.

Online conversion marketing describes the process of converting site visitors or browsers into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">paying customers</a>. While a business can't force a person to spend money with their business, they can do things to help reduce friction in the purchasing process, which often leads to greater sales.

For the client, I suggested his business start by placing a clear call to action on the home page. “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">Learn More</a>” offers a clear direction that anyone can understand. We integrated this call to action module to a prominent spot the home page, where visitors from any device could see it. However, we didn’t stop there. Using several different tools, we tested different layouts to determine the placement of the call to action to get the most clicks. We discovered that when it was just below the central image on the page, this drew the most attention for the audience. We even experimented with colors, ultimately finding that blue had the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">greatest impact</a> on getting people to click the “Learn More” button.

Then, instead of providing page after clickable page of information on the class options, we opted to include relevant information (and ONLY relevant information), as well as a “Sign Up Now” button on the second page. No longer would it require seven clicks to move a person from the home page to the checkout screen. Now, the user would be able to get there in two clicks.

With the advice of the team at our Orlando marketing agency and a little bit of website redesign, conversion rates went up 40% in a matter of weeks. This added significant revenue to the company’s bottom line, all with minimal investment.

If your business’s conversion rates are under 100%, then there’s always room for improvement. Try looking for areas of friction on your website, and work closely with a user experience designer who can help optimize your website for conversions. And, if you’re still stuck, reach out to the team at our Orlando marketing agency, who can help you learn to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">optimize your webpage for success.</a>",,10/16/2014 10:21,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Optimizing-Your-Website-Experience-for-Conversions.jpg,optimizing-your-website-experience-for-conversions,publish,,Bottom,0,closed,0
The Changing Nature of SMS Marketing for Businesses,"Throughout your day, how long do you go without sending or receiving a text message? While I’ve been putting this post together, I’ve already sent six texts… and it’s only 8:30 a.m.! It’s no wonder marketers are starting to truly understand the value of reaching customers via text. Alongside messages from people you care about, it’s becoming increasingly common to also see messages from brands you care about.

While it has long been the norm for radio stations and TV programs to encourage communication via text, the team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s Orlando ad agency has noticed that mainstream brands have been reluctant to catch up. And it’s likely due to the heavy reliance on email marketing, or a simple failure to understand how a short text can portray as much information as other forms of marketing. Think about it: People receive dozens of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">promotional emails each day</a>, and some of us even opt to keep those promotional message divided into “tabs” so we don’t have to be inconvenienced by them while we’re perusing more important messages. And, as far as using Facebook as a marketing tool, businesses who invest heavily in social media sometimes learn that only a small fraction of their total followers have actually seen their posts.

SMS Marketing is the one realm where businesses can send messages and know with a matter of certainty that the reader will receive the message. In fact, it’s this thinking that has prompted the new <a href=""http://www.ibeacon.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">iBeacon</a>, which pushes text messages to peoples’ smartphones when they’re near a store that has a beacon housed therein. Many people expect this to become a mainstay of technology, unlike QR codes, which are used heavily abroad but haven’t taken off in the United States.

For many people, text is the preferred method of communication. [quote]I even have a friend whose voice mail says, “Don’t bother leaving a message, because I won’t listen. Just text me.”[/quote] Unscheduled phone calls have become invasive, and instead they opt for text as a primary form of communication. So, it should be no wonder that people are feeling more comfortable than ever receiving text messages from the companies they adore.

In fact, SAP reports (registration required) that 64% of consumers think businesses should converse more with customers via text. Further, of the people polled, 76% said they were more likely to read a message sooner if it were a SMS instead of an email, and 70% thought SMS was a good way for the business to get their attention. For some consumers, SMS is more useful in providing “peace of mind” about identity and data, which is something to understand given a current climate of recent data leaks and hacks.

This all makes a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">SMS strategy</a> sound rather impressive, doesn’t it? If you are considering investing in SMS, there are a few things to remember, like even though it seems as if everyone you know has a smartphone, as of January 2014, only 58% of adult Americans had smartphones – many people are still relying on “dumb” phones that might not automatically read website links. Of course, the specifics of your SMS plan will involve researching and understanding your target demographic and understanding their mobile usage behaviors.

"Influence the Influencer, the BIGEYE how to guide","At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we believe <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">influencer marketing</a> can be a valuable part of any company’s marketing strategy. Influencers have the power to be “in the know” about what’s cool and interesting; something about who they are attracts others to them, which can result in an increased brand following.

Many times, these influencers can be celebrities, but often times, they aren’t. Many times, they’re just connectors, people who just happen to know lots of others based on what they do, and, by virtue of their status, have the power to lead others’purchasing decisions and ideas.

[QUOTE] An influencer might be fashion trendsetter, blogger, photographer or party planner. [/QUOTE] Somehow, these people have developed a reputation of being “in the know,”and can guide their valuable networks if brands can link into them properly. Typically, they also have large circles of influence —even if others have bigger followings, these influencers have followings that are interested and engaged in what the influencer has to say.

A brand can discover who its <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">influencers are through social media listening</a>. If people are already raving about your brand, and this conversation has garnered tons of likes, follows and comments, then tapping into this person for special deals, discounts and party invitations is a great way to take someone who’s already a brand ambassador and give them even more reasons to spread the word.

More often than not, however, marketers seek to reach new faces to dub influencers. This means having a great product, reaching out to the influencer, and offering samples and products with the hopes that they will share. While this sounds fine in theory, the problem with this is that people see right through these tactics, and often don’t give a second thought to new hair products and eyeliner pencils.

[/featured]

The best way to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">reach the influencer</a> is to be part of the conversations that he or she is part of. For example, a person who is a thought leader in the green space, and who is thoroughly against animal testing, would be an excellent target to reach out to on a personal level to talk about your brand. This might mean soliciting feedback about what the company can do to help change the social landscape of a cause that influencer can support, thereby offering an opportunity to reach the influencer in a new and personal way.

Even to an influencer’s loyal following, there seems to be an obvious difference between a paid mention and the genuine belief in a product or service. A shoutout that feels forced does much less for a brand than a shoutout that seems heartfelt and sincere. Take, for example, Oprah’s Book Club. Each time she would add a book to her book club, sales would skyrocket. One could imagine that wouldn’t be the case if that was followed by a line, “I’m being paid to say this.”

Therefore, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">reaching the influencer</a> means showing some actual care, rather than hawking product and hoping for a mention.

BIGEYE and Downtown Arts District Select Mural Contest Winner,"<strong>ORLANDO, Fla. – November 3, 2014</strong> – <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//"">BIGEYE</a>, a full-service integrated advertising agency based in Orlando, and the Downtown Arts District (DAD) this week announced the winner of its “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> on the Arts” contest – local artist German Lemus.

“Our selection committee had a difficult decision to make with such highly talented artists submitting some of the most creative mural designs,” said Justin Ramb, CEO of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>. “Ultimately, Lemus’ design captured the essence of what we were trying to accomplish with this contest. We’re extremely thankful for all of our community partners who helped make this project a reality.”

Lemus’ mural is currently under production, and will be on display along highly trafficked Anderson Street on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s building at 500 S. Magnolia Ave., right next door to the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. The mural is meant to celebrate the ad agency’s new neighbor, the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, and the area’s booming cultural corridor.

“The City Beautiful has finally blossomed into a hub of creativity, and I am in the front-row seat,” said artist <a href=""https://glemus.wordpress.com"">German Lemus</a>. “This design reflects how our city is roaring with bright colors, elegance and splendor.”

Lemus will receive a $750 cash award for participation, and art supplies to complete the project will be donated by Sam Flax of Orlando.

</ul>
“I’ve known German for many years now, as his work has been displayed at several events in the arts community throughout Central Florida and he curates and operates the Culture Xchange Gallery in the Fashion Square Mall,” said Barbara Hartley, executive director for the Downtown Arts District. “His work embodies his passion and dedication to the arts and the local community. It’s great to see his work featured in this public space.”

The mural is anticipated to be complete the week of Nov. 3, just in time for the grand opening events at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.

Applying Lean Methodology On a Corporate Business Scale,"In his book <em>The Lean Startup</em>, Eric Ries discusses iterative <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/"">product design</a>, development and launch, which he describes as “lean.” But, as many businesses are seeing, lean methodologies don’t just apply to startups. Even big businesses have plenty to learn by acting with a bias toward action.

You see, many larger, more established businesses quickly become stuck in a “behind the times” holding pattern. They have the newest, most up-to-date technology in place when they start building the company, however, these technologies change quickly. By the time a Pinterest profile is created, the company’s target demographic may have already adopted Snapchat, or some other buzzed about social media tool their audience is already excited about.

[quote]One of the ways marketers may be able to avoid missing the technological mark is by incorporating lean marketing methodologies into the process.[quote] The goal with these methods is to get the company moving forward, so that the business doesn’t stall at the dozens of rounds of approvals it takes to get a project off the ground. Instead of waiting for the stars to align, lean marketers are constantly introducing new ideas, performing ongoing tests and iteration until the project or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign reaches peak performance</a>. In some cases, this may mean forgoing rounds and rounds of ad review, and instead moving forward and then monitoring performance. For instance, the marketer can A/B test an ad and further optimize its performance.

Of course, following this school of thought means a company may be subject to mistakes. Sometimes these can be embarrassing, such as the <a href=""http://www.searchenginejournal.com/35-social-media-fails/95613/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">social media fails we hear from big brands</a> in the news from time to time. But remember, most of those brands are still in business, some with sales revenue that remain as high than ever. Save for a few outrageous errors, most customers are willing to forgive a company for a bit of a blunder. But that’s not the point: many of these massive fails are the result of hundreds of million dollar campaigns – so surely making a couple of tweaks isn’t going to destroy your business forever.

The benefit of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">testing and iterating process</a> in marketing is to initiate a learning experience. In launching a massive campaign with a huge budget, you might have some indication that it’s going to be successful based on field research and a plethora of other factors. But, you can never really be certain. Just ask the team behind New Coke or any of one of a number of <a href=""http://www.cracked.com/article_21245_5-creative-marketing-promotions-that-failed-spectacularly.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">other major marketing blunders</a>. So, by starting small, lean methodology allows a company to begin by testing, and then moving full-steam ahead with a campaign once results have afforded the marketing team with enough data to further drive the campaign.

By setting smaller goals and iterating in the moment, companies may work more efficiently, and can have successful programs to hit the market more than once in a blue moon. This lean marketing methodology is catching on all over the world, as businesses realize the impact of starting small to then go big.

Assessing the Future of Mobile Payments and how it will impact you,"If you’ve thumbed through a timely <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/09/26/digital-marketing-apple-pay/"">Fortune Magazine</a> article, or visited the publication’s website recently, you might be aware of the company’s marketing stance regarding the use of Apple Pay, a new automated payment feature on the <a href=""https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/"">iPhone 6</a>. While paying with a phone is certainly interesting (and is, in fact, already commonplace in countries such as China and Japan), this technology has actually been available for several years, yet Apple is just now incorporating it into its devices. So, what’s all of this highly anticipated buzz about? As with most Apple-branded technology, it’s safe for marketers to assume that there may be more to the story than meets the eye.

In its first week, Apple sold 10 million of its iPhone 6 devices, which offer a bundle of newly introduced features and upgrades, while also incorporating this Apple Pay technology. With Apple Pay, in addition to payments, the device also incorporates Passbook capabilities, allowing users to manage boarding passes, movie tickets, and gift cards easily from their iPhones. This new functionality also allows businesses to synch contact information with Passbook, and in turn, providing the capability to push special discounts and notifications directly to their customers’ phones.

The primary issue thus far with this payment and Passbook technology is that it hasn’t really caught on. In some ways, redeeming gift cards and coupons in this manner seems more burdensome, especially when customers are already relying on plastic cards for nearly all other processes. Even Apply Pay projections seem to imply that within the year, only 2.5% of payments will be mobile. However, Apple aims to have made a genuine attempt to remedy this by bringing merchant banks and card issuers onboard, and by employing Touch ID fingerprint technology, all in an effort to ensure the highest level of fraud protection.

On the other hand, there is one interesting trend to note - more companies are embracing mobile payments as a means of developing relationships with customers. About 15% of Starbucks’ transactions are now completed using the <a href=""http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/mobile-apps"">company’s app</a>. In a world where the app-based payment trend doesn’t seem to be gaining much traction, certain businesses have honed in on what it means to have the ability to convince the user to make a mobile payment in this fashion. App payments make purchases more efficient for the purchaser and allow the business to collect information from the user, including: favorite orders, amount spent, and frequency of purchase. Interestingly, customers appear to willingly provide this information in exchange for a reward, and a business may even establish reward parameters, such as after a user spends a certain amount.

[quote]Perhaps we aren’t entering a world where all of our payments will be made from our phones, but rather, where we’ll make purchases from places we shop frequently – all from our phones.[/quote]As companies continue to move in this direction, opportunities exist to capture even more targeted data to help tailor strategies to meet client needs, while also reducing associated costs.

As previously mentioned, the ability to make payments from one’s phone has been in existence for quite some time, however Apple has a unique, innate ability to allow its technologies go mainstream in a short period of time. As we have recently seen, 10 million more people have access to Apple Pay than they did just weeks ago, and as a result, we may be adopting a new paradigm that leads to business being conducted solely via mobile devices, thereby eliminating the need for debit and credit cards as we know them. Despite the fact that we might see early adoption in only a few companies, if the technology catches on and proves valuable, there may come a day when Apple Pay is as common as debit and credit card point-of-sale machines are today.

As a result of this shift in thought processes, marketers will also be able to continue to send relevant information to customers based upon purchasing behavior. For example, one auto company already sends automatic notifications each time its customer is due for an oil change, offering discounts based upon their user activity on the app.

Will Apple Pay be a game-changer? Probably not -  well, at least not within the next decade. But, if nothing else, this emphasis on mobile payments reinforces the notion that we’re living in an era where mobile is truly at the forefront. Marketers should aspire to continue to find new ways to reach people, starting with their smartphones.

Watch Out for the Bumps in the Road: Conversion Roadblocks,"A client I once worked with, who specialized in online foreign language instruction, offered a series of classes for a relatively low rate, yet the business’ marketing director explained that they were experiencing an extremely low conversion rate - relative to the volume of visitors to their site. This was one of the most affordable language programs in town, yet conversion rates were at a dismal 4%. He’d come to me for guidance, and actionable assistance in pinpointing the potential reasons why so many of these visitors would “bounce off” the site before purchasing classes.

When I audited his website, I was shocked to discover that there were at least seven steps involved in the conversion process. And, that didn’t include the third-party payment system that was working in tandem to provide e-commerce services. Overall, it was no wonder that the user experience was “clunky” at best.

Since the language class curriculum and offerings were a primary source of revenue for the client, I suggested a strategy that might have appeared to be an obvious solution to an experienced digital marketer, but perhaps, was not so apparent when coupled with the management of various marketing tasks associated with a large language school. My recommendation was simple: implement a more efficient process for prospective students to navigate from the homepage to the checkout phase – all in an effort to increase conversions.

To define conversion marketing in the broadest sense, it is the process of converting site visitors, or browsers, into paying customers. While there are no guarantees that a user who accesses a company’s website will “convert” – or perhaps potentially transact business – there are measures that can be taken to help reduce roadblocks during the purchasing process, which, in turn, may often lead to profitable conversions.

With regard to the client example I used earlier, for his website, I emphasized the importance of placing a clear call-to-action on the company’s homepage. For instance, “Learn More” provides clear direction that all site visitors are able to interpret and understand. When integrating this call-to-action button in a prominent spot on the home page, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s team of digital strategists determined that it was important to ensure that it was accessible across all devices by sampling and A/B testing different layouts to determine the best placement, all in an effort to ensure an optimal click through rate. As a result of our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">preliminary analysis</a>, we discovered that when placed just below the central image on the website’s homepage, the target audience of prospective students responded. In addition to placement, we also experimented with various color palettes, and ultimately uncovered that blue incited a greater number of users to “Learn More”.

The client’s foreign language program offerings were quite extensive, however rather than providing page after clickable page of information pertaining to online class options, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s digital team opted to include relevant information, as well as a “Sign-Up Now” button, on the second “inside” page. With a more streamlined process, a seemingly cumbersome number of clicks was no longer required to navigate from the homepage to the checkout screen. The prospective student was able to easily enroll in courses, reducing the friction that initially clogged the process.

With the advice of the digital experts at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando internet marketing agency</a>, and with a small amount of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">web development</a>, conversion rates increased by 40%, and all in a matter of weeks. This added significant revenue to the company’s bottom line, with minimal investment by the client. Ensuring an effective approach to manage conversion roadblocks requires the expertise of a professional partner, and our team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> is poised to assist you with your strategy.

While in this day and age (and of course, depending on the specific industry), a conversion rate of 5.31% or greater is an ideal goal, there are always opportunities to continue to strive to achieve the highest possible results. Dedicate time to review your website for potential roadblocks to the conversion process.

Concept Innovation: What Does it Take to Innovate?,"As of today, statistics show that 260,000 people in America drive electric cars. For those currently in the market for an automobile purchase, an electric car might seem like an impractical form of transportation. Electric cars are dissimilar from gas-powered vehicles, as evidenced by the shortage of charging stations in relation to <a href=""http://www.chevronwithtechron.com/"">Chevron</a> locations on stretches of open road. And accessing a full charge reportedly takes hours, so in the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, why would a driver choose to spend thousands of dollars on such non-traditional methods of transport?

At a <a href=""http://teslamotors.com"">Tesla</a> event in October 2014 in Los Angeles, the brand’s CEO and Chief Product Architect, Elon Musk revolutionized the way in which we think about electric cars, and may have left a lasting imprint on their perceived reputation in the coming years. To really ""rev the engines"" of auto-hungry consumers, the new Tesla Model D features a dual motor, meaning the car has more power and more efficiency than its predecessors. With a starting sticker price of $89k, the car goes 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds, contains a photo and radar system that works up to 150 miles per hour, and parks itself.

I have to admit, I do love Musk’s thinking here. While electric cars aren’t an entirely new concept, Tesla has certainly altered the entire concept of what it means to park one of these vehicles in your garage. What we once considered an impossible feat is now totally within reason – and then some.[quote] Tesla took a grand idea, made it even better, and then released it out into the world.[/quote]

As Tesla shows us, novel ideas - often mixed in with a little good old fashioned elbow grease during the concept development phase - always have the opportunity to be reworked and improved. At our<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> Orlando marketing agency</a>, we refer to this as “optimization”, or, in agile and lean methodologies, the industry buzzword used is often “iteration”. It is through this iteration in the Tesla automobile example – coupled with constantly striving for continued enhancement – that gas-guzzling sedans become hybrids, which in turn, become electric cars, and eventually, super-powered electric sports cars.

So what really motivates, or in this case, “drives” us, to take these types of conceptual risks when the end result could prove disastrous? What does it take to drive concept innovation? Perhaps it’s the notion that taking a chance on a new idea could be radical enough that its change is seen and felt around the globe. Musk prides himself on his work ethic, often mentioning the innate ability to work upwards of 100 hours per week. This innovative spirit can't solely be attributable to his intense corporate commitment - even as the company's CEO, I have to believe that the stimulus for success must be as a result of a much larger motivating factor.

The Musk family prides itself on this willingness to take risks. In this case, with the forethought to implement a radical idea by delivering a revolutionary product that, in turn, incited change in the automotive industry in real, tangible ways. As marketers, business owners, and experts, I believe that it is this ability to stand behind a vision and go out on a limb - when the potential for professional failure may be the ultimate outcome - that creates truly noteworthy brand and product innovation.

It’s not enough to purely be driven by revenue, it’s about delivering actionable changes in the way we see and interact with the world. There is no doubt that although there is a major, well-publicized dependence on oil in our country, the reason Musk is interested in electric cars is because he understands that this may be the way we will be mobilized in the future.

As a industry professional, I encourage you to ponder what it is - product, service, or idea - that you’re conceptualizing, and any possible ways that you may be able to iterate and improve upon it. Whether this pertains to providing your customers with an enhanced service experience,  or in taking a thought-provoking marketing campaign, and making it even more impactful. Think critically about how your service or product may positively impact your target audience, and in a greater respect, its potential to create societal change. And remember, all is not lost if you find yourself constrained by a restrictive budget - uncover opportunities to innovate that may be low- to no-cost for your business. They do exist, and oftentimes, provide far greater return on investment than those opportunities that require a substantial allocation of your marketing dollars.

While we all may not make an impact on our industry in as revolutionary a way as Elon Musk has succeeded in doing in his, we can still seek to impact the lives of our customers.

Why Customer Tracking Programs Using Data Mining Are A Win-Win,"In today’s fast-paced, technologically charged environment, it should come as no surprise that every company we interact with - whether digitally or in-person - is collecting information about us. The team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s Florida marketing agency knows that the more apps we download, the more time we spend <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">perusing websites</a>, and consequently, the more frequently we utilize rewards cards, the more we’re allowing the companies we interact with to increase their knowledge of us. The overarching purpose: to better understand how we use products and services produced and proffered by these businesses. For many years, this process, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">called data mining</a>, was mired by privacy considerations. After all, how much about my purchasing habits do I really want a large, national brand to gain access to? With a little forethought, the answer has become much clearer: the more these companies know about us, the more capable they are to cater to our needs.

Before an influx of digital tools made it easier to gain insight into consumer behavior and purchasing preferences, businesses had to do quite a bit of “guestimating.” For example, it might be safe to assume that you sold 10 cupcakes over the course of a week if your inventory confirmed 10 fewer cupcakes than you had at the start of the week. But, what does that really tell you about who you sold those cupcakes to, and when during the span of the business week they were sold? This is where a well-defined loyalty program comes in.

When companies are aware of the exact products that you’re purchasing, and how often your transaction history includes these items, programs are better tailored, offering the goods and services that align best with your buying preferences. For instance, if your retailer knows your preferred toothpaste brand, then you’re probably a prime target when that brand comes out with a new floss or toothbrush. The retailer can offer you a discount that you’ll actually use, and as a result, you may end up with a fabulous deal on an innovative new product.

While this two-way street of business to consumer benefit has been standard practice in the marketing world, it’s taken on a new life in the age of big data. Using another retailer example, this is why <a href=""http://amazon.com"">Amazon</a> is better equipped to recommend books that I might enjoy - after first becoming familiar with my current penchant for non-fiction, or why Facebook is able to directly target ads toward me – all based upon websites that I’ve visited previously.

[quote]There is a point-of-sale challenge, however - this data is much more difficult to capture during the customer’s in-store experience.[/quote] From an online perspective, Amazon has the benefit of being able to share products with its users that may be of interest to them – both while shopping and throughout the checkout process. On the flip side, while at a brick-and-mortar store, by the time you’ve reached the register, it’s often too late. As a result, retail businesses must strive to capture this data using other means. Here’s a sneaky little secret: logging-on to a store’s wifi, or accessing their app while you’re visiting a retailer, your consumer data - including your movements – may be captured, allowing for discovery of those merchandising displays that may have caught your attention.

Further developments in this space include data processing cameras that help map consumer preferences, including capabilities such as customer identification, with additional technology to recognize consumers each and every time they return to the store. While 77% of consumers claim to find this type of in-store tracking intrusive, what they may not realize is that they’re already being tracked through online purchases, mobile phone and social media usage, and many other daily activities. So, why should the in-store exchange be any different, particularly if it results in improved services and enhanced customer experience?

Yes, retailers are seeking personalized information about their consumers, just as the old adage of “knowing your customer” implies. Truly, however, most are really interested in obtaining these purchasing details primarily so they may create an unparalleled consumer experience – one that is more enjoyable and efficient shoppers, whether online or off. As a result, and in congruence with the resurgence of rewards programs, customers benefit from additional discount offerings, free samples, and other services targeted toward these uniquely personalized needs.

Assessing Ello and Emerging Social Media Sites For the New Year,"Recently, tech blogs and trendsetters alike have been talking about <a href=""https://ello.co"">Ello</a>, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">new social media site</a> designed to serve as an alternative to Facebook. In many ways, it seems preposterous that a company would try to challenge – or even potentially replace - Facebook, which is by far one of the largest technology companies in the world. What you might find fascinating, however, is that Facebook’s key target demographics tell a bit of a different story - one that leaves us pondering whether or not the site may eventually be headed in the same direction as Friendster, or a quite possibly, a “pre-Justin Timberlake” MySpace.

When I joined Facebook, which by now was approximately eight years ago, it was the quintessential online social media destination for users in their 20’s and early 30’s to communicate with one another. Rarely would you find a parent with a Facebook account of their own, and, in terms of other <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social networking options</a>, there were a few, but none were so communal. Facebook served as a landing place for all my friends – including those from many different social circles - no matter how I knew them. Times have most certainly changed with emerging social media, and with the rise of Ello, who knows? We might just end up seeing an exciting new shift in the way people access this type of online networking.

Most bonafide marketers understand that today’s “young people” aren’t as present on Facebook, and given the host of other options, they’re more likely to spend a bulk of their time visiting <a href=""http://tumblr.com"">Tumblr</a>, Instagram and Snapchat. It doesn’t take a seasoned marketing professional to know that it takes a lot of bandwidth to be everywhere at once. This is one of the key reasons why these days, my peers are generally only active on social networks in which they associate meaning to their daily lives – and, they remain active on forums where people with similar interests tend to gravitate.

Personally, I follow a lot of comedians and comedic actors and actresses on Twitter, which is the perfect venue for crafting short, funny “witticisms.” On the flip side, Facebook is relegated to keeping in contact with a wide circle of friends, while <a href=""http://linkedin.com"">LinkedIn</a> assists me in maintaining professional connections, and growing my network. I access Instagram and Pinterest daily, but other accounts such as <a href=""http://youtube.com"">YouTube</a>, Foursquare, Google+ and Vine tend to go virtually untouched and oftentimes, unmaintained.

As a digital strategist, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">my Orlando advertising agency’s social media team</a> and I truly don’t envision that Ello will succeed in becoming the new “Facebook alternative.” As recourse however, I am placing a pretty firm bet on that notion that it may eventually attract communities of its own – communities made up of Facebook users who may feel as though Facebook is not the best social media site to serve their varying needs. This might be as a result of its use of data manipulation, or perhaps, the addition of an advertising component, or simply, that users may find their personal news feeds to be disinteresting. Whatever the reasons – and there are many - we’re seeing something much larger at play here.

[quote]In creating and maintaining a social network, it’s important to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">know where your audience spends a majority of its time</a>.[/quote] If you look closely enough, you will see that users practically canvas the web – they’re accessing sites of all types. There are entire social networking sites that are geared specifically to peoples’ interests and ideologies. Often times, it may simply consist of a message board of people who are interested in topics deemed otherwise obscure, such as “hula hooping culture” or “18th century songwriting.” Topics that might not resonate with most of us, but as the moniker goes, “if you build it, they will come.”

In a similar vain, crafting and maintaining these social networks has a great deal to do with formulating a community, and marketers can utilize this lesson in helping to propagate such communities around their products. Specific audiences may be on Facebook because there’s nothing better, but I’m certain that if you attempt to present them with a dedicated forum - one that speaks directly to their area of interest - I’m sure you won’t be surprised to watch as the population of that social networking community flourishes. As a result, members have the opportunity to create connections both online and off. One such example is Fitocracy, an online forum for self-proclaimed “fitness geeks.”

I’m a firm believer that Facebook is here to stay, although with many of the above concepts in mind, the site's following may have the potential to shrink. This is particularly true as its users find more specialized social networks where they can connect with like-minded people (and not necessarily individuals that they know personally in the real “offline” world). By keeping in mind that a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">successful social media strategy</a> isn’t limited to the most popular social networks, brands can essentially begin to seek audiences in these not-so-mainstream avenues – which, in turn, might allow them to develop more authentic connections to their own customers.

Learn the Brand benefits of transmedia storytelling,"In marketing, “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">storytelling</a>” is a trendy buzzword. Marketers have often proclaimed the benefits of placing much of their advertising-driven focus on telling a compelling “story,” but what is actually represented by the story itself may be a bit hazy. That’s where the marketers at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your favorite marketing agency in Orlando</a> come in – we’ll help you paint a clearer picture of how a viable story might help you to provide positive support and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">reinforcement for your message</a>.

Before the digital revolution, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand storytelling</a> meant something very specific. In particular, it applied to the types of stories we share with one other, in both formal and informal settings, often containing an overarching narrative – including protagonists, antagonists, and the like.

With the ever-present and constantly changing advent of emerging technology, storytelling has taken on a brand new connotation (pun intended). Sometimes called transmedia storytelling, these are, from a broad perspective, the stories about your brand as told through the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">use of social media</a>, design and other elements that help give people the entire picture of what your brand is all about. Additionally, every image or bit of copy itself can also tell a story. Even Google’s “Don’t be evil” slogan gives us a pretty solid example of how the brand strives to present itself – abiding by the belief that a company that does good things for the world might be forced to forego some short-term goals.

[quote]These days, storytelling isn’t limited to the words on the page.[/quote] Let’s take a look at how we can apply storytelling in a variety of business facets:

<strong>Storytelling in copywriting: </strong>“Just do it.” “Think different.” “Got milk?” Each of these <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriting</a> examples represents a widely-known slogan. In just a few short words, the copywriters responsible for these taglines are able to tell fantastic stories about their business. But it doesn’t stop here. Content through longer-form text and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">via social media</a> are both excellent avenues to deliver stories out into the world.

<strong>Storytelling in imagery: </strong>Images are effective because they truly resonate with people, transporting them to the locale that they see in the visual. Make an impact on your audience by relying on impactful visuals to tell these stories.

<strong>Storytelling in web design: </strong>Does the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">design layout of your website</a> accurately depict who you are as a brand? Cutting-edge companies often have interesting websites that also reflect these values, whereas simple brands will employ more simplistic websites to reflect the mission of the business.

<strong>Storytelling in user experience: </strong>Beyond simply website or mobile app design, this scenario poses the question of whether the user’s experience across platforms is consistent with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story</a>. For instance, if you advertise excellent customer service, then your user experience can aptly highlight this feature by allowing ease of navigation of your apps, as well as features that place the customer at the center of the experience.

<strong>Storytelling in sales: </strong>People are much more engaged with stories than with hard facts. Use interesting stories in your sales decks and presentation in order to help highlight your business's strengths and create a feeling of “relatability” within your audience.

<strong>Storytelling in corporate culture: </strong>To at least some extent, your company’s people are the living and breathing representations of your story. Think of corporations like Google and Apple, both of which lean on their unique corporate cultures as the heart of how they do business. As an organization, who are you are, where you come from, and why you do what you do often makes for a very compelling story.

<strong>Storytelling in customer service: </strong>For Zappos, customer service IS the story. Zappos employees will stay on the phone with customers for 8 hours or longer just to fulfill the high customer service expectations set forth for and by customers. And, Zappos’ customer service commitment actually inspired an entire book called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose-ebook/dp/B003JTHXN6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405940129&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=delivering+happiness+a+path+to+profits+passion+and+purpose"">Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose</a>, which essentially contains a collection of stories the culminate in the overall Zappos brand story.

Steps to Defining A Competitive Advantage In Your Market,"When operating in a highly saturated market, it is especially important for a business to have a competitive advantage that sets the company apart from the others. Finding that one thing that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">makes a business unique</a> involves being innovative and thinking strategically about an industry. For example, <a href=""http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/"">Coca-Cola</a> operates in the soda market with <a href=""http://www.pepsico.com/Brands"">PepsiCo</a>, but many customers choose to buy a Coke because of its perceived value.

In the business world, strategy is all about creating and implementing a competitive advantage that is unique, profitable, and sustainable. The goal is to provide direction that allows your business to perform in a way that is superior to your competitors. And while it may be easy to develop a strategy, it isn’t easy to develop a successful strategy… Here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, our marketing solutions are rooted in strategy to ensure that our clients see superior financial results.

Is your competitive advantage unique? If not, maybe it’s time to rethink it. Here are the two fundamental steps to finding your business’s true competitive advantage.
<ol>
 	<li>Have a complete understanding of your business environment or landscape. This includes defining the forces that shape competition, the key players in your market, the drivers of your industry’s future, and where your firm interacts in the industry.</li>
 	<li>Next, choose where to compete. How will your business position itself? Evaluate the industry using <a href=""http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Tools/essential-tools/Pages/porters-five-forces.aspx?TestCookiesEnabled=redirect"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Michael Porter’s “Five Forces Framework”</a> as a tool to choose your positioning. The positioning should speak to the value perceived by your target market.</li>
</ol>
These two steps should result in finding a competitive advantage that results in customers choosing your firm over competitors.

3 Questions To Ask When Appealing to the Mom Market,"Does your brand need to appeal to the all-powerful Mom Market? If so, ask yourself the following three questions to ensure your target audience chooses your brand over the competition:
<h3>1. Is Our Brand Memorable? Is It Easy to Find When You Look?</h3>
A brand that is not memorable lacks staying power. Though the brand doesn’t necessarily need to be in mom’s face at all times, she does need exposure to the brand and needs ways to be able to find it when needed. In this era, being able to find the brand means that she can find it in the store, using Google, or on Amazon. [quote]<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/the-daily-mom-app/"">Check out BIGEYE’s successful mom marketing strategies that brought The Daily Mom App to the Top 25 Downloads Position on iTunes.</a> [/quote] The harder it is to instill this brand into one’s memory, the harder it will be for brands to generate loyalty in their targets. In order to help make the brand memorable, it’s essential to go to the platforms where moms are sharing information with one another in order to leave a lasting impression.
<h3>2. Is Our Brand Meaningful? Where is the Connection Point Between Our Product and Our Target’s Life?</h3>
The greatest brands are the ones that make life better. Whether it’s enjoying a meal together at <a href=""http://olivegarden.com"">Olive Garden</a> or walking through the mall in attention-getting Gucci shades, those brands that have <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">positive impacts on the target’s lives</a> are the ones that will succeed in creating preference. Without meaning, there’s no difference between buying Huggies and buying store brand diapers; but many moms are more apt to go for the Huggies because of their variety of facets, such as age-appropriate diapers, that help ease the frustrations of changing diapers. Huggies have made a connection point not only in their marketing, but also in their appeal to make women’s’ lives easier.
<h3>3. Is Our Brand Likable? What’s Great About Our Product? Why Do Existing Customers Like It?</h3>
Brand marketers should work to ensure that their brands are in line with the desires of mothers. A brand with a tough edge can open up it’s market to the modern mom by softening up, portraying the brand as likeable and fun. The brand marketer should embellish the aspects of their products that make moms’ lives easier, more exciting and more fulfilled.

Sometimes it’s not just about the product, but about the brand as a whole. A company that sells necessities for children can reach moms by bundling items such as diapers and baby wipes. Also, with new developments in big data, it’s easy to monitor what your users are saying about your products on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">other social media outlets</a>. Marketers can learn what existing customers prefer by region, income level and numerous other demographics. It’s easy to overlook small ideas, such as the recent insight that moms like shopping at <a href=""http://homedepot.com"">Home Depot</a> because it offers a sense of empowerment.

Shaping Your Business Model Is More Important Than You Think,"A company chooses how to compete in a given industry with its business model - also known as its plan to make big money! A business model states a firm’s logic, operations, and value. Companies must navigate between two considerations to shape its business model:

1. The first consideration is the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/""><strong>value proposition</strong></a>. What is the main value your company brings to its customers? [quote]A value proposition can be based on low cost, differentiation, and in some cases, a combination of the two.[/quote] A value proposition can be based on low cost, differentiation, and in some cases, a combination of the two. A firm based on differentiation offers a product or service that appears to be more desirable than alternatives, and therefore, customers are willing to pay a higher price. Whereas, a firm based on low-cost attracts its customers by offering a product or service at a better value than alternatives. The third value proposition, a combination of low-cost and differentiation, is more difficult to offer because providing a higher quality product or service is a larger investment.

Here are some examples of the types of value propositions to give you a better idea of where your company may fit:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""http://lululemon.com"">Lululemon</a>: Differentiation – Lululemon provides high quality, unique fitness and lifestyle apparel that customer’s are willing to pay for at a premium cost.</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://walmart.com"">Walmart</a>: Low-cost – Walmart is a mass merchandiser that has everyday low prices.</li>
 	<li><a href=""http://traderjoes.com"">Trader Joe’s</a>: Combination – TJ’s offers a one-of-a-kind experience in store and a compelling brand while maintaining low-cost products.</li>
</ul>
2. The second consideration is the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/""><strong>target market</strong></a>. A target market can be defined as either a mass market or a niche market. Typically a firm that is focused on low-cost targets a mass market, while a firm focused on differentiation focuses on a distinct market. For example, Walmart is able to offer products at the lowest prices because it targets a mass market. This results heavy store traffic and high purchase volume that are required to operate at low gross margins.

Client Appreciation That Creates Real Brand Advocates,"On this, “National Customer Appreciation Day” – how do you go above and beyond the “call of duty” to show your clients how much you care about them? I’m often asked if it’s more costly to pursue a new client, or if retaining existing clientele has the greatest impact on a company’s bottom line. While it might appear subjective, it’s a fairly widely held opinion - and the data tends to support the notion pretty consistently  – that it’s both pricier and consumes a greater portion of your employees’ time to generate new business. That’s all the more reason to ensure that your existing clients are busily singing your praises, isn’t it? Seriously, who wouldn't want to ensure that current customers aren't also your most valued brand advocates?

Thinking back, you’ve likely had at least one highly positive and thoroughly memorable customer service experience that compelled you to quickly share the good news with your friends and associates. As a company, how do you make that type of behavior the norm, in which your employees are empowered to provide only the highest level of client satisfaction - and that they proceed to do so every single time you’re “at bat” with your valued customers?

Consider, for instance, the selfless act recently recounted to me about a sales experience with a national retailer that was ""share-worthy."" Rather than ordering a book via <a href=""http://amazon.com"">Amazon</a> or another online merchants, my friend decided to trek to her local bookstore – a less convenient brick and mortar destination – to purchase a much-anticipated book as a gift for her spouse for his birthday. After searching the racks of new arrivals to locate her target gift, she came away with little success. Arriving at the customer service counter, <a href=""http://starbucks.com"">Starbucks</a> in-hand (a frothy latte always seems to make any shopping experience that much more pleasurable), she provided the name of the book, and waited patiently as the associate researched its availability. No luck – the coveted present was already sold out, with the bookstore’s next expected delivery shipment at least one week away.

Rather than turning my friend away with little time left to place an online order in time for her husband to unwrap the best seller that topped his list of “must reads,” the associate willingly called the store's major competitor to offer additional assistance. Sure enough, they had a copy, and my friend left the store with a broad, caffeinated smile, knowing that the book she so anxiously sought would be ready and waiting for her with no further effort on her part related to her search - even if it meant paying a visit to the competition.

What compelled the associate at my friend’s first bookstore shopping stop to take the extra step, and go the extra mile, to ensure that her purchase was easily attainable? This example can be translated into nearly any industry – it’s interchangeable. My friend couldn’t wait to tell others - to excitedly share the news with me and my fellow guests at her spouse’s birthday celebration. You could sense her delight when she recounted her experience. That’s employee empowerment: the bookstore employee helped my friend walk away feeling appreciated and valued, even without completing her purchase with the initial retailer.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">At our Florida advertising agency</a>, we strive to do just that – to provide the necessary expertise and support to allow our clients’ goals and objectives to be attained, while ensuring that expectations are consistently exceeded.

So, keeping in mind the bookstore experience, how do you effectively guarantee that your client’s expectations are continually exceeded – so much so – that they'd be willing to refer new customers to your company, based solely upon their sheer satisfaction with a routine job well done? <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact</a> us today to allow our team to help you gain, and retain, highly satisfied brand advocates - for life!",,1/20/2015 16:03,9,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Client-appreciation-keys-to-creating-brand-advocates.jpg,client-appreciation-that-creates-brand-advocates,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"The top advertising trends for 2015 are here, are you ready","Ron Swanson- it’s a name that brings to mind breakfast, Tammy’s, abhorrence for local government, and staying off the grid. In a particularly memorable scene from NBC’s hit show, “<em>Parks and Recreation”</em>, Ron receives a personalized pop-up ad on his computer and later discovers (to his horror) what happens when he Googles his home address. In an effort to regain his privacy, he tosses his cellphone and computer in the dumpster. Typical Ron.

Fortunately for advertisers, though, most people are not Ron Swanson. Some <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a> users might not even bat an eyelash after seeing a Warby Parker banner ad. But just take a moment to Google eyeglasses nowadays, and you’ll quickly discover that these types of tailored ads are truly an integral part of our web browsing experience. While the decline in “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional” advertising</a> may still leave a bitter taste to some advertisers, this type of interconnectedness within the digital world is good news for agencies, and a homerun for reaching a highly targeted audience - just as long as the content remains “up to par.”

With a smartphone attached to everyone’s hip (or an <a href=""http://apple.com"">Apple</a> watch on their wrist), implementing real-time promotions and advertisements is both convenient and relevant; now, through location services and GPS, advertisers can even geo-target consumers based upon where they are, and at any moment.

Personally, I receive a lot of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">promotional emails</a> from clothing stores. A lot. Everyday. Did I mention it’s a lot? Yet for every one hundred BOGO coupons cluttering my inbox, I’ll take the time to look at - even possibly use - just one. Sure, I have about 50 items in at least three online shopping carts, but nothing is really compelling me to click on that fateful “Place Order” button. The silver lining: potential new clothes are “piling-up” in my shopping cart, while my wallet stays full. That all changes when I’m out running errands or visiting a new city – those same brands and boutiques that I’ve previously browsed online might employ geo-targeting, sending me push notifications if I’m near a physical, brick-and-mortar store. (And sneakily, they may include a coupon, to dangle the carrot further). That sense of urgency to purchase a shirt I don’t need sure does grow a lot stronger as I think, “Well, I’m already here, I may as well stop in…” Suddenly, it’s bad for my wallet, but boy, oh boy, is it great for business.

Speaking of online browsing, 2015 marks the year of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile marketing</a> more than ever before. With tablet use increasing and smartphones becoming the size of tablets, mobile web browsing has become the most common way to access the web. [quote]In fact, more than 50% of Internet users are browsing on mobile devices.[/quote] In fact, more than 50% of Internet users are browsing on mobile devices. For companies, this means creating mobile-friendly sites that operate seamlessly on a smartphone, anytime and anywhere. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">website’s design</a> can be flawless on a desktop, but without mobile capabilities, it’s content has the potential to miss reaching nearly half of the target market. After all, what good was all the diligent work completed by web designers, if the smartphone user isn’t able to marvel at it’s sleek interface?

There are a series of features that should be standard at this juncture - like in-app calling, directions, ordering-placing, etc. Companies or brands whose mobile sites are not embracing this technology could find themselves way behind the eight ball. I’m not sure about you, but if I can’t quickly look up a local restaurant’s menu on my phone beforehand, I’ll likely choose to dine elsewhere. Call me a diva, but my smartphone and I just don’t have time for that.

Yet all of this is fairly useless if the content your brand is producing lacks quality and authenticity. The consumer has been able to pick and choose what he wants to see, and can easily ignore the rest- TiVo and the DVR changed the game for broadcast advertisements and the Internet has seen the introduction of AdBlock. Just getting your brand’s product name to the consumer can be tricky, and when you do, man, are they picky.

But with all this said, this <em>is </em>a good thing. Yes, agencies have to work harder and get more creative than the old click-bait strategy, but with content-driven marketing, the consumers that do choose to learn more are more likely to act on their interests. And at the end of the day, what good is 10,000 page hits if no one buys what you’re selling?

When it boils down to how “on the grid” we all are, paired with the technological advances we’ve made in recent years, the possibilities are endless in the digital world of advertising. The future isn’t so scary now, is it? (Looking at you, Ron).

The power that lies within the Super Bowl XLIX ads,"Ah, the Super Bowl. For football fanatics, it’s the most important day of the year. For others, it’s an excuse to enjoy a few brewksis and some BBQ on a Sunday night; employees and bosses alike can be seen donning sunglasses indoors come Monday morning, free of judgment. Fried chicken wings are a viewing-party staple and high-fives can be heard throughout the sports bar. It’s a great day to be an American.

It’s also a great day for advertisers. For one night only, the country, whose viewing behavior typically includes a finger affixed to the remote control, set in fast forward for those notorious “TV time outs” - anxiously tunes-in to a series of commercials, rather than actively ignoring them. [quote]Expectations are high, as the Super Bowl has a history of airing some of the greatest ads of all time. [/quote] <a href=""http://wendys.com"">Wendy’s</a> “Where’s the Beef?” spot is still admired 30 years later, and no one can forget the <a href=""http://www.budweiser.com"">Budweiser</a> frogs (even though, I’ve now dated myself, given that the last commercial featuring the trio was in 2000). But with such high viewership comes an even higher price tag attached for precious airtime. NBC’s asking price for Super Bowl XLIX? A cool 4.4 million to 4.5 million per each 30-second spot. That’s some serious pay-for-play.

Not surprising, landing a spot isn’t an option for most companies - just ask Newcastle. The brewer’s media budget for the entire year was half of what it would cost to buy a spot during the 2014 Super Bowl, so instead they got crafty and made something even better. Being inventive was a requirement, if the brand were to compete amongst a sea of frothy hops-induced advertising.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">company’s campaign</a>, entitled, “If We Made It,” showcased just how outrageously silly, epic, and awesome their ad <em>would</em> be - cleverly playing on the fact that Newcastle could never really afford the ad space to begin with. One of the fan favorites featured a foul-mouthed Anna Kendrick, who was hired to star in the Super Bowl commercial, only to discover Newcastle backed out because they had no money. It was a genius move for Newcastle, using self-deprecating humor and honesty to turn their disadvantage into a successful campaign - one that earned itself AdWeek’s #1 Ad of 2014.

In other words, Newcastle Brown Ale managed to air the most memorable Super Bowl ad, without actually making a Super Bowl ad - or paying for one. Cheers, you sneaky geniuses.

On the flip side, you’ve likely noticed that many advertisers are now pre-empting the “grand reveal” of their much-ballyhooed debut of epic, witty, and oft-discussed ads - designated specifically for the BIG game, and with BIG budgets - in advance of kick-off. As an advertiser, this is a fairly <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brilliant strategy</a> to obtain the greatest media mileage for a spot’s hefty purchase price. The conversation gets going early, the buzz begins via social media and marketing industry experts, and viewers immediately know what to look out for when they tune into the game.

I have to admit, what is likely a very logical idea from an ROI standpoint sure does feel a little bit like peeking at your holiday gifts in secret before unwrapping them in front of friends and family. What do you think? Which advertisers’ spots do you anticipate will be most-talked about around your office the “day after?” How do you feel about gaining early access to “sneak peeks” at Super Bowl commercials? My guess is, we’ll all have more to discuss than “deflate-gate” with our co-workers come Monday morning.

The top three most common advertising myths debunked,"Fact versus fiction. Fairytale versus reality. With an influx of industry buzzwords, tales of lore, and books, blogs, and the like, all speaking to the virtues of best achieving your marketing goals and objectives, how do you siphon out the true misnomers? There are most certainly plenty of these truths that abound on advertising industry websites and in trade publications, even delving into what it’s like to work at an agency (certainly far less Scotch than <em>MadMen</em> depicts - and a lot more Diet Coke). However, there are a few myths and misconceptions about the industry that can potentially hurt your brand.

<em>Here we present 3 common advertising myths, debunked:</em>
<h3>1. Advertising is too expensive</h3>
Contrary to popular belief, successful advertising does not always require a multi-million dollar media budget. While a smaller budget may seem restricting, it can also lead to an outside-of-the-box approach. Razors-by-mail company, <a href=""http://www.dollarshaveclub.com"">Dollar Shave Club,</a> received widespread recognition after launching it’s first YouTube video entitled, “Our Razors are F****** Great,” featuring founder and CEO Michael Dubin. The video went viral, and prompted 12,000 orders in a two-day span after it was released, and has received over 17 million views as of January 2015. The cost of the video? Just $4,500.

Much of the success was due to Michael Dubin’s background in improv and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production</a>; in fact, the video was so funny that many people thought it was a spoof. Within the first hour of it’s release, the heavy flood of Internet traffic actually crashed the website. As a small startup, the Dollar Shave Club just didn’t have the revenue to promote the brand the same way Gillette and Schick do, so they had to find a way to reach the masses on a small budget - and they most certainly did.
<h3>2. If the product is good, there’s no need to advertise</h3>
It’s easy to assume that if a product/service is the best of it’s kind in the market, it’ll simply ‘sell itself’. It’s a logical argument; why would people buy a subpar product over the superior one? Well, for the same reason people choose Microsoft over Apple (is my loyalty too obvious?): perception. Dunkin' Donuts offers free Wi-Fi and serves good coffee at a reasonable cost, yet people aren’t hanging out or working on projects and papers in the Dunkin' Donuts “lounge.” Despite having 20 years less experience than Dunkin' Donuts - and a higher price point - Starbucks continues to remain the long-standing market leader in coffee shops. Why? <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">Brand perception</a>. Starbucks certainly wasn’t the first of its kind, and some could argue it’s not even the best of it’s kind (don’t tell that to Megan, our Marketing Manager, though), but it is <em>perceived</em> as the best- and that’s really all that matters.

So if being first doesn’t matter, and even being the best doesn’t matter, then what does? People interact with each other on an emotional level, and the same holds true for people and the brands they choose. <a href=""http://us.coca-cola.com/home/"">Coke</a> isn’t selling soda: it’s selling <em>happiness</em>. It’s selling the nostalgia of sitting on the front porch in the summertime with Grandpa, sipping an ice cold Coke through a straw. I couldn’t give you a rational, logical reason as to why I pick up Tide instead of Gain - I honestly have no clue as to which gets my laundry cleaner - yet Tide is what my mother used, and the smell reminds me of going home (I could ask her why she buys Tide, but she probably couldn’t come up with a better reason either). [quote]People buy <em>stories</em>. People buy <em>emotional connections</em>. [/quote] People buy <em>lifestyles.</em> But loyalty doesn’t happen by accident and it doesn’t happen overnight. Gaining recognition through advertising, building trust with the consumer, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">positioning your product or service</a> to be <em>perceived</em> as the best is strategic, continuous, and necessary for new and long-standing brands alike.

So even though I’d get the same caffeine jolt from a pot of coffee as I would from a $5 latte from Starbucks, there’s just something about that green and white cup that says, “Bring it on, day. I’m ready for you.” And that’s just what Starbucks intended.
<h3>3. Social Media is Easy</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Social media</a> is simple - not easy. While your 13-year-old niece might have more Instagram followers than you, it wouldn’t be wise to hire her on as your company’s social media director. We’ve witnessed so many social media mistakes in the past year alone; you’d have to wonder if these companies really <em>did </em>hire their teenage niece to run their Twitter account. Jumping on a hashtag without looking into it, posting irrelevant or too-personal content, being inconsistent with your brand’s values – these are common mistakes that companies continue to make, year after year. But social media blunders aren’t just the cause of red-faced embarrassment; in fact, they can cost your company millions of dollars. In a survey sponsored by Symantec, participating in social media can cost major corporations an average of $4.3 million. That is a huge loss for a misstep that could have been easily avoided.

The power of social media is strong and has done wonders for brands and consumer engagement (see: <a href=""https://twitter.com/tacobell"">Taco Bell’s Twitter</a>), but it’s only useful if done strategically. Actively participating and listening to customer needs, complaints, and opinions is what makes a brand feel authentic through social media. Bombarding consumers with promotional statuses every day? Not so much.

Your brand has a voice and social media is your microphone- but you have to be consistent, genuine, and relevant. Otherwise, no one is listening, or worse, they’re furious (just look at the backlash from companies using MLK Day as a publicity tool. Yikes.)

The top three reasons Facebook advertising pays out,"To advertise on <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a>, or not to advertise on Facebook…that is the million dollar digital marketing question.

It’s a common refrain among small and large businesses alike - even though 1.23 billion people (and counting) are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">using the popular social media site</a>. With such a massive audience pool to begin with, it’s guaranteed that a good percentage of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> will have a presence on Facebook (even if some are not regularly ""active""). No matter what, the odds are certainly in your favor here. Still, it makes sense to wonder if spending a pretty penny on Facebook ads is really beneficial at creating engagement between your brand or company and your intended audience. As it turns out, Facebook advertising not only works for businesses, but is one of the most cost-effective means of generating brand awareness and targeting new leads.

Here are <strong>3 reasons why Facebook advertising pays dividends</strong>:
<h3>1. The ability to target specific markets</h3>
One of the biggest advantages to Facebook marketing is the ability to specifically target your preferred audience. More traditional methods of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">targeting</a> prospective customers based solely on simple demographics are inefficient compared to using more detailed psychographics to target consumers. With Facebook ads, you're able to market directly to users - all based on their particular interests, age, gender, or online activity- at once. So if, say, you’re a ladies online clothing retailer, you can not only advertise to a specific gender, but also target those who shop online and have interest in fashion. You really can’t get more tailored than that, no pun intended. Why is this more effective for businesses? Because now your money isn’t being spent on ads going to an audience with no interest or intention of becoming a new customer; instead, targeted ads increase new business with potential customers as well as increase engagement with current customers. And the last thing a business wants to do is waste money. Speaking of money…
<h3> 2. It’s cost-effective</h3>
Not only are Facebook ads gaining as much, if not more, awareness for your business than TV and radio, but they have the lowest CMP, or ""Cost per 1,000 impressions"" in history: an average $0.25 per 1,000. That is 1% the cost of TV advertising. Moreover, the minimum cost to advertise on Facebook is $1 a day, yet it’s potentially more effective than traditional forms of advertising (due to optimized targeting). By doing the quick math, that’s only $30 a month - obviously, very little risk with incredibly high reward- rewards you can monitor thanks to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/advertising/solutions"">Facebook’s Ad Manager</a>.
<h3>3. Tracking ROI and awareness</h3>
With Facebook advertisements, it’s easy to monitor spending, performance, and, most importantly, ROI. You can track the number of impressions (including reach and frequency), activity (page likes, comments, shares, etc.), as well as CPC, Cost per Like, and Cost per Conversion. By easily <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">tracking consumer engagement</a>, you can test different ads, promotions, and posts, as well as A/B test unique targeting options to see what works best for your company.

For instance, if you’re targeting prospective customers that aren’t relevant to your business, or if your ads have too broad a reach, then the corresponding page “likes” you acquire might be rendered useless - and in some cases, engagement will be minimal. On the flip side, Facebook advertising functionality has significantly advanced since it’s inception, and the targeting options have grown to become far more sophisticated. Advertisers are now able to target prospective customers based on particular interests, age, gender, or online activity – all in one fell swoop. So if, say, you’re a ladies online clothing retailer, you’d have the opportunity to both advertise to a specific gender,<em> and</em> target those who shop online and possess a vested interest in fashion. You really can’t get more tailored than that, puns intended.

[quote]So it’s no longer a matter of <em>if</em> your company should advertise on Facebook, but rather, deciphering the most strategic game plan to maximize engagement once you've decided to promote your brand socially. [/quote] To use a term popularized by comedian Will Ferrell, with a little ""strategery,"" employing Facebook’s sophisticated advertising features will ensure that the rewards far outweigh the financial investment.

For the love (of everything Valentine's Day marketing),"Ah, Valentine’s Day. It brings to mind candlelit dinners, flowers sent to the office, and eating entirely too much chocolate. For some, it might even rehash haunting memories of good ol' Johnny from third grade who gave his handmade valentine to <em>Sarah -</em> while going steady with <em>you</em>.

But as it turns out, most of the world isn’t jaded from mourning relationships of grade-school's past; Valentine’s Day marketing should account for spending expected to reach $18.9 billion this year, up from $17.3 billion in 2014, according to the <a href=""http://nrf.com"">National Retail Foundation</a>. To break it down: $1.7 billion will be spent on candy; $3.6 billion on a special meal or date; $4.8 billion toward jewelry; $2 billion on clothing; and $2.1 billion for flowers. Oh, and let us not forget the ever-popular, last-minute present: the gift card (at $1.5 billion). These numbers are significantly higher than 2014, ensuring a pretty stellar start for 2015 holiday spending. In fact, nine out of ten consumers expect to spend money on their spouse this February 14th - (leaving us to deduce that one out of those ten consumers apparently <em>likes</em> sleeping on the couch.)

For curiosity’s sake, just how much of an affect does advertising truly have on Valentine's Day spending? The biggest trends in 2015 V-Day marketing seem to be the use of promotions, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">interactive marketing</a>, and naturally, those familiar “I’m not crying, there’s just something in my eye!” television commercials. (I know you don’t want to admit that you had to reapply your mascara after viewing another lovey-dovey ad, right?)

If you haven’t already noticed, brands are getting extra cute - and especially creative - this season. <a href=""http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/home.html"">McDonald’s</a> announced February 2<sup>nd</sup> that their stores would be accepting an alternative form of payment now through Valentine’s Day: hugs! You’ll have to be chosen by the cashier, though, so we suggest batting a few eyelashes and perfecting that “James Dean-esque” wink to be one of the “chosen few.”

While Valentine’s Day is typically celebrated by couples (some of my friends choose to celebrate February 15<sup>th</sup>: the day holiday candy goes on sale), dating site <a href=""http://match.com"">Match.com</a> and Starbucks are making it even easier for singles to couple up at the coffee shop. Match’s mobile app now includes a section entitled, “Meet at Starbucks,” where users can click a call-to-action button, and email one another to arrange a coffee date. So, what was the impetus for this nifty idea? Well, it was sparked by none other than the 3 million members who use coffee-related keywords to describe themselves. Additionally, Starbucks will be offering a few special coffee and pastry deals (such as a cookie and raspberry mocha - for the bargain price of $5) in conjunction with their “World’s Largest Starbucks Date” event.

Of course, our list of prime Valentine’s Day ads that convey the power of the holiday wouldn’t be complete without your quintessential Hallmark tearjerker. The greeting card company’s campaign, “Put Your Heart to Paper” features real-life couples describing their feelings without speaking the word “love.” The goal of the campaign is “to celebrate all types of relationships and the type of things anyone would appreciate hearing on Valentine’s Day.” Hard not to let that line of love notes tug on your proverbial heartstrings.

So, what does Valentine’s Day marketing mean to you as a consumer? Are you driven to purchase items for your sweetie solely based upon your reaction to a specific ad's sentimental messaging? [quote] Does ""warm and fuzzy"" content - be it print, video, or otherwise, have an impact on your spending habits on this “most loved” of holidays? [/quote]

Is there a link between organized chaos and creative clutter?,"As the old adage by Albert Einstein goes, ""If a cluttered desk is the sign of a creative mind, if what then, is an empty desk a sign?""

On the contrary, there’s an entire industry of self-help books and motivational speakers dedicated to “de-cluttering” your life, so surely there must be something wrong with a messy workspace. Right?

Maybe not, says science. Actually, there might be some warranted truth to Mr. Einstein's musings - creative clutter may indeed be where it's at.

While your mother had good intentions when she asked (or, quite possibly begged) you to clean your room and put away your belongings as a child, studies have proven that Mom might not always know best. (Shh, don't tell her, of course.) In fact, thriving in a messy environment could actually <em>promote</em> creativity. Kathleen Vohs, PhD, of the <a href=""http://carlsonschool.umn.edu"">University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management</a>, performed a study on this phenomenon and found that adhering to working in a clean, tidy environment encourages people to do normatively “good” things, such as donating to worthy causes and make healthy lifestyle choices. However, if you’re looking to get those creative juices flowing, you might just be better off leaving that clutter right where it is. (Again, our sincerest apologies to Mom.)

To prove the theory that slight disorder encourages creativity, Vohs conducted three experiments (the details of which can be found <a href=""http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/tidy-desk-or-messy-desk-each-has-its-benefits.html"">here</a>). The takeaway, though, was that the participants in the messy room came up with more creative uses for a ping pong ball and chose new products over the older, better-known version than those in the neat and tidy room. It shouldn’t come as much of a shock, however, that keeping your belongings in unconventional places would promote an out-of-the-box thinking approach. On the other hand, being in an orderly environment, like sitting at a desk where everything is in its preferred place, more likely influences us to conform to conventional expectations. Interesting food for thought, huh? (And for those of you ""non-neat freaks,"" that's not necessarily a pun referring to the stale sandwich tucked away in your junk drawer that you've long since forgotten.)

Be warned: before you haphazardly rearrange your supplies around your office, keep in mind that clean desks aren’t completely without virtue. In the same study, those in the tidy room were more likely to donate to charity and eat an apple over a candy bar. So, if you’re one of the strong-willed few still sticking to that New Year’s Resolution (it's okay, we won't tell if you take advantage of one little splurge on this Fat Tuesday), it might not be the worst idea in the world to take a few moments out of your day to tidy things up a bit. However, if you’re looking to be the next Steve Jobs, Mark Twain, or even Einstein himself, then you go ahead and savor in your organized chaos. Heck, you know exactly where that one file is within the piles, don't you?

Now, if only a theory could be developed to encourage us not to have to eat our veggies…

What you should know about Snapchat advertising and teens,"I won’t lie: I wasn’t an early adopter of <a href=""http://www.snapchat.com"">Snapchat</a> when the disappearing-photo app first arrived on the scene. Call me a smidge shallow, but my rationale was always that if I’m going to take the time to capture a picture of my oh-so-perfectly arranged lunch in lighting so undeniably""#nofilter needed"" good, then I'd like to at least think that I'll score a few “likes” out of the deal.  But with Snapchat, I find myself a bit perplexed. I mean, what’s with all this “disappearing” photo business? Where’s the recognition for my impressive food photography skills, and how on earth will my glorious meal live on in infamy?

Slowly, (and after receiving plenty of Snapchats from friends), I came around to adopt the idea. I figured, what the heck- it’s catching on, so there must be something behind the phenomenon. Stories I've heard repeatedly speak to it's benefits, and I’m not the only one getting in on the Snapchat game. In fact, the app has topped 100 million monthly users. And as large of an audience as that is, you may be surprised to discover that national brands are willing to shell out $750,000 a day (!!) on disappearing ads featured in the “Recent Updates” section. Seriously. Over half a million big ones for ads that only last for 24 hours? That’s mind blowing.

…Or is it?

[quote] The reasoning behind Snapchat’s high price tag for advertising is that it’s not merely reaching a sizable audience — it just so happens to be<em> the</em> largest audience -  made up of the most challenging demographic for advertisers to reach effectively: teens and tweens. [/quote] As young adults move away from <a href=""http://facebook.com"">Facebook</a>, and toward picture and video-heavy social media formats like <a href=""https://vine.co"">Vine</a> and <a href=""http://instagram.com"">Instagram</a>, Snapchat makes a excellent case for the logic behind a heightened minimum cost per ad. In addition, it’s immediate, and since users are required to click directly on these ads to view them, there are some pretty strong opportunities for engagement. On the other hand, there are no analytics for advertising on Snapchat like we find on  Facebook, which understandably leaves plenty of brands a bit leery at the prospect of paying such a high cost without numerical data to effectively back it up. Brands such as McDonald's are currently reaping the rewards of Snapchat advertising (even without the analytics support), and other companies - such as HBO, Nars, Macy's, and even the New Orleans Saints - are following suit by using the app. While not all companies have the budget required to shell out a pretty penny per ad, there is always an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">opportunity to reach the teen audience</a> organically as a low-to-no-cost alternative. This method may not have nearly as much reach, but it does include limited analytics (you have the opportunity to view who has seen your post - although often only during the specified 24 hour time period in which your ad appeared).

Personally, I’m not surprised that brands are forking over that kind of dough (pun absolutely intended when thinking back to my photogenic lunch) to advertise on Snapchat. If all the kids are doing it, it’s only a matter of time until companies are following suit. The question now is, “Is it there long-term value?”

What goes into the beauty of a brand’s social campaign,"Looking back at ad campaigns with lasting impact, one could safely gauge that the past year-and-a half has undoubtedly been that of taking an honest look in the mirror (naturally, pun intended) through judgment-free eyes – at least that's been the mantra according to <a href=""http://www.dove.us"">Dove</a>. From the brand’s “Real Beauty Sketches” to the short video “Evolution,” I have to admit that Dove has been a breath of fresh air when it comes to empowering women. Continuing this message on to Super Bowl XLIX, Dove challenged us all to think differently about doing things “like a girl” – with the basis of running, throwing a ball, and the larger impasse – showcasing the differences in how young women, boys, and young girls respectively perceive the phrase. The Super Bowl ad won significant online kudos for changing the conversation, and again, during the 87th Annual Academy Awards, the brand started an entirely new conversation — this time on <a href=""https://twitter.com/"">Twitter</a>.

As part of a hashtag campaign, #SpeakBeautifully, Dove teamed up with the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media platform</a> to add a positive spin on some of the negative tweets about beauty and body image on awards night. Arguably one of the chattiest (and often, cattiest) nights on social media, Dove created a Twitter tool that identified hateful keywords, and responded to them with non-automated tweets during the show. When someone tweeted a nasty comment about someone else, Dove’s Twitter accounted tweeted back constructive advice to encourage more positive online language and habits.

The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a> is based on a study done by Dove, which found that 50% of women are more likely to post something negative about themselves on Twitter, rather than positive. Even more upsetting, four out of five women encounter negative tweets commenting on other women’s appearances. Twitter CEO Dick Costalo has addressed the issue that seems to run rampant on Twitter, saying “We stink at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've been bad at it for years. It's no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day."" Through a strong partnership with Dove – viewed as having changed the paradigm in the industry - on this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">social media campaign</a>, he endeavors to encourage positivity towards women, and on a grander scale, initiate changed perceptions on the Twittersphere.

It’s no surprise that the significant, lasting impact of social media’s oft-unmonitored commentary and postings may prove to be incredibly damaging to women’s self-esteem, especially for young girls. As a caveat to that, the anonymity of the Internet, including insults easily shared regarding appearance, can be even more hateful and significantly more widespread. “Ideas and opinions about body image are now fluidly shared every second through social feeds, and sometimes we do not fully realize the resounding impact of the words in even one post,” says Jennifer Bremner, director of marketing at Dove. [quote]“The power to #SpeakBeautifully is in the hands of us all – we can positively change the way future generations express themselves online.”[/quote]

The campaign, Dove says, will continue long after awards season is over. Social change doesn’t happen overnight, but the #SpeakBeautifully campaign sends an inspiring message – that hopefully social media will serve as the catalyst to create a less hostile online environment for women.

Although it’s early in the year, (and admittedly, this national brand has tried to make me cry twice already), I’m growing to realize that there can be true societal beauty in a brand’s social media presence. We at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> admire a company that uses such a highly televised event to promote genuine, positive change - and not to simply push a product to consumers. Dove, if we could present you with an Oscar for that, we most certainly would.

Betting on an impulse: Visual retail merchandising,"Considering the prevalence (and incredible convenience) of online retail outlets such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/"">Amazon</a>, it’s no surprise that these channels are gaining popularity. In fact, a whopping <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/81-shoppers-conduct-online-research-making-purchase-infographic/208527"">81% of shoppers research products online</a> prior to completing a purchase, causing retailers with brick and mortar shops to grow increasingly creative - with even more compelling offers - in an effort to nudge prospective shoppers out of their homes (and their footie pajamas), and actually into stores. As a result, creating emotional and visual intrigue and really connecting with your target demographic has become even more critical to a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand’s marketing strategy</a> – due in large part to the digital shopping cart.

This desire to be blown away (and out of those comfy pj’s) by in-store design hasn’t emerged out of nowhere; in fact, it’s part of my biology… and part of yours, too. It’s well documented that as a group, humans tend to make purchasing decisions based largely on this type of emotional connection. We’re actually hard-wired to pursue certain stimuli, and it’s this arousal and consumer intrigue that honestly compels us to spend money, initiating purchases that we often weren’t planning on making. (Those retailers are onto something, aren’t they?) Truth be told, this is why I can’t simply walk past the Brooks Brothers window display without feeling the urge to stop in for a quick gander around the store - only to find myself at the checkout with yet another button down shirt, perfectly starched pair of khakis, or a stylish new sport coat.

Furthermore, there really is both an art and a science to creating effective retail visual merchandising displays. On the artistic side, the <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">BIGEYE</a> team encourages our clients to design expressive displays that create a sense of awe and intrigue – driving the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target customer</a> to connect with the brand so much so, that they cannot possibly return home empty-handed. However, on the more scientific side, we rely on facts and data to determine what will drive customers into a store, drawing from fields as diverse as neuroscience, anthropology (this time, the study of humans, past and present), and psychology. It seems to harken back to the old advertising industry adage, often quoted by the “original Don Draper” himself, David Ogilvy that, “It’s not creative unless it sells.” Typically, this expression pertains largely to copywriting, but upon further contemplation, we think it especially holds true for retail visual merchandising component, as well.

According to a 2014 research report from Merzer, the physical store environment is an important element in retail decision-making, as <a href=""http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/impulse-purchase-survey.php"">75% of purchases are unplanned or made on impulse</a>. How many times have you gone in to <a href=""http://www.target.com/"">Target</a> for “just one thing,” only to end up in a busy checkout lane, complete with a fully loaded shopping cart? This is telling, as is shows us the power of a well-designed store, and to a more concentrated degree, the presentation of the in-store displays themselves. Our goal, then, as marketers, is to enhance this experience, so much so that we’re building the retailer to consumer connection, and ensuring that the correct messaging is being delivered to the desired customer - as component of the overall branding experience.

Specifically, when it comes to retail visual marketing, the questions that we specifically want to answer boil down to:
<ul>
 	<li>Which brand elements are going to generate the greatest degree of interest from our target market?</li>
 	<li>How can we best appeal to a relatively broad demographic that represents our ideal customer?</li>
 	<li>How are we able to develop a display that entices our target demographic to select products proffered by our brand – and to complete a purchase – versus choosing the competitor’s product?</li>
 	<li>What is our audience seeking when selecting specific companies, brands, products, and services – and how do we connect on an emotive level?</li>
 	<li>Which specific marketing elements may we incorporate into our overall strategy to build <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">awareness</a>, and to ensure that our brand is perceived as a differentiator?</li>
</ul>
We all know that with the hustle and bustle of our lives, we find that we’re busier than ever before, and in this digital era, it’s imperative to design a display that will capture a consumer’s attention – and fast. After all, your brand may not only be in heated competition with other brick and mortar retailers, but also with the plethora of online shopping options. Although the online landscape was once presumed to be the end of the storefront, it’s now evident that shoppers want to continue to engage in heightened brand connections through in-store experience shopping. Companies are event able to employ sophisticated marketing techniques to combine their in-store displays with innovative digital campaigns to take advantage of capturing new customers in both stratospheres, developing a perfect media mix.

Oftentimes, we hear about retailers who have not yet partnered with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">developed marketing team</a>, and as a result, they fail to understand the connection between their in-store displays, and the impact on ROI. As marketing experts, we are armed with the knowledge and experience to tap into the human psyche to drive individuals to make purchases. Not only are we able to provide the necessary expertise to encourage optimization of these displays for success; we are also able to use purchasing information to better analyze the ongoing success of these recommendations. When it is determined that an initial strategy needs further thought and strategy, we’re poised to complete the additional testing required to maximize revenue opportunities - developing insights that inform and enhance a brand’s overall marketing strategy.

If your brand is seeking highly effective retail visual merchandising strategies, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> is well-equipped to partner with you. We’ll ensure that your retail environment is an immersive brand experience that truly connects with your target consumer and drives them to purchase. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">Contact us</a> today by calling 407.839.8599.

Creating effective retail visual merchandising displays,"When it comes to retail strategy, the companies that are, indeed, “getting it right” understand the importance of effective retail visual merchandising displays. These are the oft-admired businesses that attract attention by partnering with merchandisers, designers and artists to conceptualize immaculate displays that garner attention - even from far away. Think of it this way: with a penchant for specific brands, and if given the option, most consumers would typically choose to work remotely from their local <a href=""http://www.starbucks.com"">Starbucks</a> location, versus setting-up shop inside a <a href=""http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en.html/"">Dunkin’ Donuts.</a> Why, you ask? Well, it’s a fairly simple concept when you think about it. Starbucks stores have a connotation with the promotion of calm productivity; from the artwork hanging above the tables, to the light strumming of latte-friendly background music, the coffee retailer upholds its vision through and through. In contrast, the “America runs on Dunkin’” brand, (while also incredibly strong), caters to the on-the-go coffee drinker, and it’s fairly apparent in the brand’s visual merchandising, as well. Although these two companies center a majority of their promotional efforts around coffee shop marketing, and despite having a hugely similar product, the associated consumer messaging is starkly different for each brand. As a result, both have proven, successful approaches - appealing to their respective target consumer for pretty obvious reasons: speed and convenience, or relaxation and comfort.

That certainly doesn’t dilute the value of a caramel-drizzled cup o’ joe, now, does it?

So, what’s the “secret ingredient” to retail visual merchandising success? While there really is no secret formula to ensure that a brand’s message will effectively resonate with the wallet-toting, Frappucino®-loving consumer, one of the most critical - and often most powerful - elements when delivering messages via in-store channels is to ensure that displays contain two critical elements. They must be both aspirational, while also maintaining a company’s ability to deliver on its brand promise. In other words, the customer must feel as though the brand’s commitment is being fulfilled - be it a steadfast promise to adhere to service quality standards, the caliber of the ambiance of a store’s location, or to product innovation. When she purchases from your company, she must feel as though your retail strategy falls closely in line with the overarching brand strategy. Interestingly, this is why companies like Hollister go for the “California cool” approach by enlisting the use of surfboard displays and Yellowcard on their music playlist. On the flip side, and completely on-brand, the backlit displays in Chanel stores elicit a certain degree of elegance and posh. Ideally, these messages will subliminally permeate throughout the brand’s media mix, initiating a comprehensive customer experience that begins with the consumer’s initial impression, and maintains the same – or heightened – levels of engagement throughout the customer journey, and the comprehensive sales funnel.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, one of the greatest cross-industry challenges we see companies encounter is in crafting enticing, attractive, and compelling retail visual merchandising displays. While some brands have been known to pay lip service to the perceived potential impact that robust merchandising has on a customer’s decision to purchase, we know all-too-well that conceptualizing designs without actually taking the necessary steps to execute them properly is a futile effort. Here’s the proof in your perfectly prepared Peppermint Mocha: psychology studies have shown that impulse buying ultimately comes down to seeing a given product. Companies may actually be able to coax customers into making certain product purchase decisions based upon product displays, assembled in a manner that elicits a “can’t pass by without directing at least some degree of focus on a product” mindset. Remember the time you purchased that candy bar you didn’t need while waiting in the Trader Joe's checkout line? How about picking up yet <em>another</em> coffee tumbler from the aforementioned Starbucks location you frequent? Well, you can thank science for that! In fact, Lars Perner, Ph. D and Assistant Professor of Clinical Marketing at the <a href=""https://www.marshall.usc.edu"">University of California Riverside’s Marshall School of Business</a>, believes that the more visible the product is, the more likely it is that people will, indeed, purchase it. This, of course, is all provided that the consumer is aware of the product, and its intended purpose. (Sadly, I’m all too familiar with the consequences of that pesky candy bar on a girl's waistline, and yet, I’ll purchase it anyway. <em>Sigh</em>.)

[quote]Through extensive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a>, we’ve seen the proven impact that the effective arrangement of a display has on consumer behavior, with the primary approach always focused around the development of a poignant theme. [/quote] Developing a dynamic proposition opens up the doors to possibility in terms of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">visual storytelling</a>. Too many times, we see brands crafting displays in an effort to find as many common connections as possible, all the while, thinking this will result in an increase in product sales. Ironically, too much clutter or disorganization within the theme can cause confusion, and may actually dissuade potential customers from entering a store. Maintaining this focus on the central theme is crucial when constructing a display’s design.

In New York, where companies spend millions of dollars on interactive retail visual merchandising displays during the holidays, shoppers line the streets of Fifth Avenue specifically to see the winter window displays. Light shows, music, and interactive yuletide imagery entices chilly (albeit exuberant) shoppers to enter these stores to engage with the brand – and hopefully, to spend large sums of money as they purchase gifts for friends and family. These companies have deduced that they have the distinct opportunity to sell more product, simply by showcasing items in a big and bold manner, as opposed to blending into the visual scene scape. It’s driven by an individual's inherent attraction to this novelty, as people are impressed and excited by things they haven’t seen or experienced before.

Color also has significant visual impact on purchasing behavior, so we mustn’t forget that fact. It might seem silly, however using starkly contrasting colors does, in fact, cause an instinctive reaction - likened to the primal sense of emotional arousal that our ancestors would have experienced when seeing a tiger – can you believe that one? Attribute this with the notion that certain colors also have the potential to trigger various conscious and unconscious emotional states, and designers can actually <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">create color combinations</a> that will attract and divert attention to these products. For instance, red is the most commonly used color in restaurant visual marketing, as it stimulates excitement and even appetite; the second is yellow, which invokes feeling of joy and optimism (are <em>you</em> craving a Big Mac right now, <em>too</em>?) But if the brand promotes health-consciousness and well being, most often the color of choice is green—think Whole Foods and, (dare I mention them <em>again</em>), Starbucks. The influence that color has is much stronger than most of us consciously realize; and by selecting the perfect color combination, your brand can have a very persuasive impact - likely without the consumer having any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">awareness</a>.

So, when you’re considering strategies that may really make a substantive difference between a second-rate display and a insanely powerful one, hopefully, you've now sufficiently consumed a little retail merchandising food for thought. We've uncovered some pretty powerful analytics regarding trends and concepts that make in-store shopping so appealing, and if you’d like to learn how to increase your business’ revenue, paired with a positive impact on purchasing decisions based upon best practices for visual merchandising in retail, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">contact </a>the BIGEYE team today to get started!",,3/6/2015 10:00,26,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_192068741.jpg,creating-effective-retail-visual-merchandising-displays,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
The science of retail visual merchandising and consumer behavior,"Consumer spending habits - what truly drives behavior? We're not talking about simply coercing prospective shoppers into your store, we all know (as does your bottom line) that at the end of the day, it involves so much more than the simple volume of foot traffic. Truth be told, we ALL want to compel consumers to actually<em> transact</em> business, which comes down to exploring the science behind those all-important strategies and proven effective retail visual merchandising techniques that will generate an uptick in sales. Here's the million dollar mystery: how do we captivate customers and capture their attention in a fast-paced, competitive retail landscape? At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, a retail visual merchandising agency, our goal is to transform businesses by helping them better understand these buyer behaviors and purchasing decisions -  and to design messages that reach, resonate, and compel customers to take action. This could be why I have more throw pillows than I'll ever need - honestly, <em>one more</em> accent blanket and my living room could look just like the <a href=""http://www.potterybarn.com"">Pottery Barn</a> display. Gets me every time.

[quote]Oftentimes, when playing ""psychologist"" and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">conducting focus groups</a> and other exploratory research, we uncover a disconnect between a brand’s ideal essence, and the in-store presence that is being communicated via visual merchandising displays - unbeknownst to the client. [/quote] When engaging with a skilled retail visual merchandising agency, our approach starts with a gap analysis to determine a company’s strengths and weaknesses inherent in its existing retail strategy. This process affords us with the opportunity to make changes that have a lasting impact on a potential customer's decisions to purchase specific products, drilling down by factors such as color preference, price point, and a number of other characteristics. While this gap analysis serves as the initial brand ""discovery,"" it always leads us to the identification of  areas of improvement and easy, high-impact wins (talk about two birds, one stone!). Taking this information, we then work with our clients to redefine their retail strategy. In some cases, this may mean updating the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">business’s brand strategy</a>, or even embarking upon an overall rebranding process.

Then, we look to actual retail visual merchandising services, and identify tactics we can use in order to drive success. Here's one way to break down our approach: identifying tangible and intangible techniques that we may use to better implement and stimulate customer interest in the specific products being sold.

With tangible techniques, we’re focused on how customers are influenced by aspects such as window displays, brands, signage, sight-lines and other clear, visible aspects of the design - elements that as a retail visual merchandising agency - we're able to control. The intended results of our efforts include altering these techniques, and making ongoing revisions to continue to both compel, and to draw in more customers. I'm an uber-savvy consumer, too, and as a result of a number of these strategies being implemented in-store, I find that one minute I'm <em>just looking</em>, and next thing I know, the sales associates are offering to help me carry my overfilled shopping bags. It's okay to admit it - you know you've been there, too, <em>righ</em>t? Proof positive that using tangible techniques simply works, albeit when implemented correctly, of course. For the tangible, we emphasize those tactile aspects of building displays that will capture our customers’ attention.

To highlight the winter campaign for London-based men's clothier, <a href=""http://www.bensherman.com/"">Ben Sherman</a>, images of London at night were used as large format backdrops in the store’s windows, featuring twinkling LED lights, capturing the Christmas spirit in a dreamy and luxurious way. Additionally, Hostem, another London clothing store featuring progressive Japanese brands, accentuates their avante-garde fashion through the use of visual merchandising. The impressive (and award-winning) displays are always unique, yet fitting to their aesthetic; using items like vintage church pews, ladders, old beer kegs and cases - even a Chesterfield sofa from the 19th century. It is this use of visual merchandising that truly allows shoppers to experience complete immersion of the brand when walking through the store.

On the other hand, when it comes to intangible techniques, we’re looking into the deeper psychology of how people react to certain stimuli - all of which are impossible to touch. For instance, we may look at customer influence via the senses (sight, touch, taste, smell and hearing), reactions to combinations of color and light to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">create visual effects</a>, and the use of furniture to create social familiarization. For instance, many stores employ specific scents, think warm cookies fresh out of the oven - all in an effort to elicit a sensual consumer response, where shoppers are ""hungry"" to spend more. In addition, offering samples of products - food, perfume, or even makeup - may entice a customer to purchase the specific goods and products being promoted. Through the exploration of intangible techniques, we take a more theoretical approach to consumer behavior, based upon plenty of inferences, and supported by detailed, qualitative data. This is why I’ve yet to enter a Target and leave with only the items I planned to purchase - see, once again, the power of psychology is at play.

The benefits of partnering with a retail visual merchandising agency are tenfold, and through our exploratory research and based upon client implementation and testing, we've uncovered that both of these types of tactics have the potential to have significant positive impact on your bottom line. In research done by IJESIT on the effect of visual merchandising, 85% of the study’s participants agreed that color, lighting, ambience and attractive visuals (and we mustn't forget welcoming scents, as in the prior home-baked cookie example) make them spend more time in store. In applying both tangible and intangible tactics, we are able to create cohesive retail displays that generate an emotional association with a brand's target customers. Be it the individuals who prefer the heavy discounting of “sale” goods, or the power of a stunning display that seemingly - and rather inexplicably -  compels a person to buy, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>'s skilled team members understand each company’s need to master such practices in order to ensure that shoppers are drawn into a store, and that they remain interested in its inventory throughout the customer experience.

Finally, we take our learnings and incorporate them into a business’ media mix, identifying ways to create brand alignment in all channels, including both <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">interactive</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional media</a>. The goal of this portion of the process is to retain customers and encourage them to become brand advocates, serving as active members of our brands’ communities.

Iconography and retail consumer goods package design,"Ever taken a moment to really think about the goods and service we use everyday? How about the retail consumer goods <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">package design</a> of the products we embrace most frequently? If you haven't guessed it, we are a highly visual and emotional species. It's a hugely interesting exercise to contemplate why we're driven to make certain purchases, and to have preferences and leanings toward specific brands. Well, the choices we make are due in large part to the look and feel - the tangible presentation elements - of our favorite products, and the emotions they evoke within us as consumers.

[quote]Our product-buying decisions, and a significant portion of that emotional response, come from the invaluable  art and science of effective retail consumer goods package design.[/quote]

Our product-buying decisions, and a significant portion of that emotional response, come from the invaluable  art and science of effective retail consumer goods package design. Here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we’ve decided to take a look at some of the most iconic, recognizable retail consumer goods packaging, and what makes each so highly memorable - and hugely popular - among the buying public.
<h3>Tiffany &amp; Co</h3>
Typically, sales packaging like a box holding a new necklace wouldn’t garner much attention. I, for one, usually rip open a package without any hesitation (or ladylike grace) if I’m expecting some glittery, golden goodies. However, it doesn't take a novice to note that <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324557804578372971590782176"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tiffany’s robin egg blue box</a> is almost as valuable as the jewelry it contains. The coveted box, wrapped up in a luxe satin ribbon, has inspired wedding decorations, cakes, and centerpieces - the company even has it’s own blue box charm that sells for $250. In fact, empty boxes have even been known to be hot commodities on eBay and Etsy. The distinct color, some say, was chosen because turquoise was a popular jewelry color at the time, although no one is entirely certain of its iconography. In any case, the robin’s egg color (also known as No. 1837, representing the year the company was founded) is instantly identified with Tiffany’s; while the box still says Tiffany &amp; Co., it certainly doesn’t need to. And for those of us who obsess over the origin of specific colors from a design aesthetic, Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of The Pantone Color Institute, says, “It evokes positive thoughts and reactions, and this, combined with the status that Tiffany has assigned to it, makes for perfect packaging.” Our inner-gemologists would tend to agree.
<h3>McDonald's</h3>
McDonald's. Mickey D's. Nothing seems to instill excitement in a child at dinnertime quite like a McDonald’s Happy Meal box. Perhaps it was because my brother and I were only treated to those tasty chicken nuggets and fries on special occasions (like getting good grades, or when our mother just <em>really</em> didn’t want to bother with dinner), but that feeling of pure joy experienced whilst waiting in the drive-thru line is something that continues to resonate with me today. And the anticipation of knowing there is a prize waiting inside that red and yellow box? That was only half the fun. While the images on the box may change, and the promotional campaigns surrounding the tasty alternatives to mom's cooking have evolved over time, the feeling it elicits in a child still remains. At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we're still lovin' the effective use of retail consumer goods package design for our beloved burger and fries.

[quote]<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/barnies-coffeekitchen/"">Take a look at how BIGEYE took an established coffee chain, Barnie’s Coffee, and modernized their packaged goods design. </a> [/quote]
<h3>Amazon Box</h3>
No time for a trip to the mall? Thanks to the juggernaut that is the online shopping phenomenon, our lives have become ever-influenced by the ease and simplicity of making purchases via the wonders of the Internet. As an adult, that same sense of excitement I felt when getting a <a href=""http://www.mcdonalds.com/content/us/en/food/meal_bundles/happy_meals.html"">McDonald’s Happy Meal</a> is now provoked by seeing that distinctive package on my porch. While the price point of my online treasure is surely much higher than a value meal, that doesn't prevent me from feeling the sheer thrill and delight I experience upon seeing my order arrive on my doorstep. There's just something different about the Amazon box—and I think others can agree. In fact, the simple cardboard box with the Amazon logo is raved about so enthusiastically on Twitter, you’d think it was the online equivalent of the Tiffany box. Ponder for a moment about how that simple arrow on the side of a basic cardboard package makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside - and how easily you can return to your computer to make it happen all over again with the few simple clicks of your mouse. Sheer bliss, indeed.
<h3>Chanel No. 5</h3>
I’m not certain what people are more interested in when purchasing Chanel No. 5: the perfume, or the bottle. The sleek curved glass, single white label, and black sans serif type is modern class at its most exquisite. Beloved for generations, the design is sophisticated, timeless, and has even sparked Chanel to design a plexi-glass clutch version of the iconic bottle. Who wouldn't want to take a little of Madame Coco - and all her finery - with them as a compliment to their favorite ensemble? Santa, are you listening? I know it's early, but <em>clearly</em>, the list above covers <em>all</em> my ""wish list"" items accordingly.

Based upon the examples above alone - and there are so many we've left off our list - it's fairly safe to say that the the power of packaging is far more important than just practical design, although that is certainly necessary, as well. The design needs to speak to the brand advocate's needs and emotions equally, and directly, in the effective promotion of a product to really illicit the appropriate reaction, and to positively impact buyer behavior. The end result: brand elements that fully support your overarching objectives, and perhaps even attain that iconic status we marketers revere.

It's all about the game of marketing march madness,"Ah, Spring. The days are longer, hotter, and the beaches are filled with travelers reveling in the splendor of precious days spent enjoying long-awaited spring break vacations. Whether you’re a flip flop loving Floridian, or you’re still longing for a day at the beach, sporting your winter coat before it’s confined to your closet for months, there’s one thing we, as marketers, can all agree on. The NCAA Men’s Basketball tourney, affectionately known as “March Madness” is upon us, and it’s a game-changing, time zapping phenomenon – with the potential to serve as an advertiser's annual dream come true.

While in the workplace, CEO’s might tend to focus on the dreaded decrease in productivity - employers stand to lose up to $1.9 billion in 2015 alone – the benefits for brands who take advantage of the exposure associated with those teams selected to make it to ""The Big Dance"" have the potential to lead to some pretty impressive profit margins. (<em>Surely</em>, that makes up for the hours lost ""studying-up"" on office bracketology, right?) Well, you don't have to be a multi-million dollar, nationally recognized company with a significant budget to implement highly effective strategies related to marketing March Madness. It can really be as simple as a bank shot.

So, what are the true playmakers that your brand might consider during this ""Super Bowl"" of collegiate basketball? At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we've put in the practice time off the court to present you with a few pointers (all three's, <em>of course</em>) to help you master marketing March Madness:
<h3>Develop a bracket contest</h3>
Every office has one, so why not create a little healthy competition with your followers online? Drive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">traffic to your website</a> by creating a contest to engage with your fans, with a noteworthy prize for the winner. While you may not be able to present a national championship trophy as your coveted prize, there are some creative, outside of the box opportunities to generate buzz, and further your brand's advocacy.
<h3>Host a game viewing party to showcase your fun side</h3>
Host a fun-filled game viewing party, whether attended by your staff, or where you invite clients to join the festivities. Who doesn't love a good tchotchke? Provide logoed goodies to your partygoers, then move the party highlights - and hijinks - to your Facebook and Instagram pages to boost likes - again, affording you with an opportunity to get in front of new followers.
<h3>Consider your target audience and be top-of-mind</h3>
According to <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/press/ceo-building-yahoo-men-160393"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">AdWeek, the average age of the avid college basketball fanatic is men under the age of 50</a>. Make sure your promotional outreach is highly visible where this audience spends most of its time during the tourney. Be it a sports bar, online updating his bracket - or bragging about his selections and prediction prowess - focus your campaign's strategic efforts and media mix to ensure that effective placement is a top offensive priority. [quote]You've got the ball, and the expertise to showcase your brand's personality and unique selling proposition, so drive down the court and land a slam dunk.[/quote]
<h3>Share relevant - and really captivating - content</h3>
Be sure that any and all content you share will have perceived value for the seasoned fan. Remember, a number of those that you engage with have been filling out a bracket season-over-season for years, and you'll want to provide entertaining, informative, and intriguing information that resonates.

No matter your budget, the opportunities to jump on the bandwagon - and capitalize on marketing March Madness - are endless. Win or lose, sports aficionados are in high spirits, and with a little creativity, you might find that advocates for your brand may become as devoted to you as they are to their beloved team. And did I mention that I just might have set-up my own bracket based upon colors and mascots alone? (Who knows, I just might make it to the Final Four, so feel free to be inspired by my technique!)

Differentiation and retail consumer packaged goods design,"<em>With great packaging, comes great power. </em>

We may have butchered the <em>Spiderman</em> quote just a bit, however when referring to retail consumer packaged goods design, these truly are wise words for a brand to live by.

When analyzing consumer behavior, and contemplating the all-important psychology behind a buying decision, it might seem relatively obvious, but prospective consumers will tend to notice a product's packaging first; and arguably, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">product’s packaging</a> is just as important as the product itself. I can’t tell you the number of times that I've willingly skipped over, or perhaps even overlooked, a potentially great product, simply because the packaging seemed inefficient, cluttered, or just didn’t catch my eye. As the old adage goes, we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover - but if it saves me money, and prevents the opportunity for me to unknowingly taking home an inferior product, I’ll likely stick to my gut, and the lasting first impression of a brand as it's been initially instilled in my brain. And did I mention that if delivered in a manner that is enticing enough to match-up with a product's perceived value, it's hard to resist temptation? Many retailers are well aware of this game - and have it completed mastered - although some have taken heed of how to maximize the effectiveness of retail consumer packaged <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">goods design concepts and strategies</a>.

Keeping this type of compelling design in mind, nearly every aspect of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">brand’s packaging</a> must be determined by the brand’s overall identity. The game-changers in the field of retail consumer packaged goods design are those who know how to sufficiently intertwine the presentation of how the package and product should appear to the eligible consumer. Think about this example from Silicon Valley: Apple has practically made unboxing a new iPhone an art form, likely because of the sleek, minimalistic packaging - no pesky plastic to break apart or cardboard to cut - and this is reflective of the iPhone’s sleek design and uncomplicated interface. It’s just so much fun opening that clean, white box with the expectation of what awaits. While it may not be your first iPhone, the attention to detail and extent to which the package becomes a part of the buyer's brand experience is undeniable. And while enjoying the sheer bliss of unwrapping my <a href=""https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">iPhone 6 Plus</a> earlier this year, I couldn't help but ponder the fact that I've been a long-time customer of the Apple brand, and the experience - as matched appropriately with the functionality and capabilities of the mobile device - keep me coming back for a newer model year-over-year.

While possessing some degree of retail consumer packaged goods design differentiation undoubtedly has its benefits, attaining the iconic status in packaging that retailers Apple and <a href=""http://www.tiffany.com/?siteid=1"">Tiffany &amp; Co.</a> have mastered, and as mentioned in our previous blog, doesn’t happen simply by chance. [quote]Achieving such branding perfection begins in large part with the presence of strong brand identity, a dose or two of creativity - and immense knowledge of your ideal consumers’ expectations. (And capitalizing on those expectations.) [/quote] At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we've compiled three key tips to consider when developing your own captivating retail consumer packaged goods design concepts, in an effort to ensure that each has the potential to resonate with your target audience on an iconic level:

<strong>1. Know your audience.</strong> What issues does your ideal client complain about most when it comes your product type? What aspects do they praise? When seeking to create sleek, beautiful, or practical packaging, the responses to these simple questions are a thought-provoking launching point. For example, it’s absolutely crucial for make-up companies, to listen to women’s reviews on products - especially on packaging. Studies prove that women are almost overwhelmingly turned off by the lack of a pump on a foundation bottle, regardless of the product’s quality; while in other instances, women have reportedly - and more often than not - impulsively purchased expensive lipstick simply because the tube was gilded and gorgeous - with an often <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">prominent logo</a>. Listening to what your consumers both need <em>and</em> want from retail consumer packaged goods <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaging design</a> can honestly make or break a perfectly great product - even if the vibrant shade of said lipstick is undeniably perfect for the season. Madame Coco Chanel, I'm talkin' to <em>you</em>.

<strong>2. Give experiential packaging a try.</strong> While not conceivable for all products, the consumer's experience with a product’s packaging doesn’t have to come to an abrupt end when the item has been successfully taken out of the box. HBO’s dark-humored drama, <em>Six Feet Under</em>, released a beautifully designed “complete series” box set a few years back that corresponds with the show’s somewhat grim subject. A tad tongue-in-cheek, the top of the boxed set features fake grass and a grave marker, displaying the name of the series and the date it began and ended, while the sides of the box resemble dirt. Taking it one step further, the box containing the series' DVDs stands at 6 inches tall. Equally creepy and stunning, the smart design correlates with the show itself (and doubles as outstanding Halloween decor).

<strong>3. Explore the benefits of going green. </strong>Research proves that it's often worth it to ensure that your brand is perceived as ""earth-friendly.""<strong> </strong>Nielsen’s 2015 Global Survey on Corporate Social Responsibility shows that <a href=""http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/dk/docs/global-sustainability-report-oct-2015.pdf"">66% of global online consumers across 60 countries are willing to pay more</a> for products and services from companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact. What does this mean for your brand? It’s simple: packaging a product in recyclable, reusable, or sustainable container is a consistent reason for consumers to choose your product over a competitor's. For this reason alone, socially conscious initiatives are not only beneficial to Mother Nature, but might also prove lucrative to your bottom line. And admit it, that's a <em>real</em> win-win.

Truth be told, whether a brand's retail consumer <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaged goods design</a> lends itself more on the side of quirky over stunning, or simplistic over creative, its popularity in a competitive buyer's market truly boils down to a unique selling proposition. Your brand must communicate its product and benefits in a manner that is equal parts functional, entertaining, and enthralling. Apple watch, I can't wait to see what your packaging holds in store.

It's all about Marketing brand culture: Ain't that a kick!,"You can dance if you want to. And if you’re a football player - make that fùtbol (better known as soccer in America), Spanish magazine, <em>Libero</em>, will actually <em>make</em> you get up and tap your toes in your cleats.

In an effort to better emphasize marketing the brand's “Culture” section of their sports magazine, the publication creatively turned soccer players’ casual warm-ups, feints, passes, and other tricks into dance moves by looping video footage of these practice hijinks to music. While no one needs (or wants) to hear the “Can-Can” ever again, we have to say, watching those boys “dance” is worth the earworm that you risk inheriting by viewing the associated ad. (And you have to admit, we're all too familiar with those musical earworms that you just can't seem to shake - ""<em>Shake It Off""</em>, anyone?). But in any case, as if you needed another excuse to watch these gifted athletes put their impressive skills to work, we encourage you to check out all of the #footballdancing videos <a href=""http://adsoftheworld.com/media/tv/libero_football_magazine_dancing_football_cumbia_dance"">here</a>.

Speaking of magazines, while the argument that print media is “dying” may be up for debate, it is true that magazine sales are, indeed, slipping a bit. <a href=""http://www.foliomag.com/2016/newsstand-sales-dropped-16-percent-in-2015/"">In 2015, newsstand magazine sales dropped 15.8%, while there was a 13% drop in revenue</a>. Convincing folks to pay for subscriptions or purchase a single copy is getting far trickier than in years' past. So, how does a medium combat this potentially weakening sales and maintain relevancy? Although <em>Libero</em> has only been in circulation since 2012, and despite being relatively new to the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print media game</a>, the ultra-modern sports mag has made quite a name for itself thanks, in part, to these intriguing, cheeky videos used effectively to market brand culture to readers - and viewers - alike. For instance, the publication's first set of ads from January 2014, featured women explaining how to best tackle day-to-day tasks such as taking out the trash, dating, relationships, and the first instance of meeting the father-in-law - and even rounded things out by leaning on breakthrough fùtbol examples and lingo. The ad’s slogan was pretty inventive: “If you explain it with fùtbol, it makes sense.” You have to admit, it's sassy, light-hearted, and pokes fun at the “meathead” sports fan stereotype - all the while successfully promoting the magazine.

This time around, and in order to further highlight the soccer mag’s same “Culture” section, <em>Libero</em> uses the <a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/24730571/Libero-Football-Magazine-Football-Dancing-TV"">#footballdancing</a> idea to prove that even the most athletic men can still dance - well, at least, with the help of some film editing and alongside perfectly fitting background music. A football gal myself (particularly of the collegiate variety), I found myself intrigued by these brand culture ads, and was compelled to visit the magazine’s website. While I'm not fluent in the Spanish language, the ads still resonated, crossing international language barriers - and leaning on the notion that our appreciation of talented athletes is universal, and doesn't require a translation.

While print publications may be experiencing a downturn in sales, there is no shortage of soccer fans here in the United States. The sport is gaining undeniable popularity among the masses - and perhaps, even an increase in American readership of <em>Libero</em>. For Orlando City Soccer, which just kicked-off its 2014 season, more than 62,000 fans packed into the team's current venue, the Citrus Bowl, for the inaugural match. Due to such high demand, Orlando City president Phil Rawlins recently indicated that the team is open to the possibility of constructing its new stadium - slated for completion in time for the first game of the 2016 season - <a href=""http://www.orlandocitysc.com/stadium"">with a higher capacity than the currently planned maximum of 25,500</a>. If you ask our team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, its an exciting time - and an interesting soccer ball spin - on scoring a branding goal that has resonated with a fan base receptive to creative, unique brand culture marketing efforts.

We couldn't be more excited about the new stadium and the early success of Orlando City Soccer - even for a college football gal like me. <em>GOOOAAAAL!!</em>

Taco Bell's breakthrough into fast food advertising for breakfast,"Live más, and say adios to your boring breakfast sandwich. Actually, Taco Bell wants you to ""defect"" from your standard sunrise sammy altogether.

That's the premise of the newly released ad touting the Mexican chain's foray into the early morning menu market. It's no secret that the Golden Arches have solidified their standing as fast food marketing breakfast leaders, however Taco Bell, long considered the ""scrappy underdogs"" - known more for late-night <a href=""http://www.tacobell.com/food/menuitem/Crunchwrap-Supreme"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Crunch Wraps</a> than early a.m. bacon and eggs - emerge to break you free from “circular sameness."" Taco Bell's new, rather somber, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a> reimagines McDonald's promise of happiness - with a darkened spin. Envision good ol' Ronald McDonald, only this version has sunken eyes and a harrowing smile, and serves as the totalitarian dictator of the dystopia, Routine Republic, with oppressed citizens underwhelmed by uninspired Egg McMuffins. The grey cement walls of a drab city are covered in majestic sunrise propaganda posters, declaring “Same breakfast, same routine, same smile” with the loudspeaker ironically announcing how wonderful and happy everyone supposedly should be. Meanwhile, just across a filthy ball pit and a field of land mines that explode with glitter (arguably the less violent, similarly traumatic equivalent), is a world where people enjoy hexagonal breakfast foods, sunshine, and a spectrum of color. The protagonists of the story, a brooding male character and his attractive female counterpart, are finally fed-up with “sameness” and escape (set to the anthem of rebellious teens everywhere, “Blitzkreig Bop”).

As far as production goes, the concepts are incredibly imaginative. From the communist-era artwork of the propaganda posters, to the dingy yellow tube slide the army of unsettling Ronald McDonald lookalikes slide down, the ad exudes McDonald’s “breakfast tyranny”. But, at the same time, “it can't help but come across as some kind of Meta wormhole, like a microcosm of capitalism trying to devour itself. A smaller fast-food giant is knocking a bigger goliath for creating a fantastical totalitarian communist state,” as AdWeek puts it.

Another interesting twist is how cheekily Taco Bell compares the fast food marketing frontrunner to communism and the associated regimes of Stalin and Mao. Of course, it’s entirely possible that Taco Bell’s target young adult demographic might not be as familiar with communism in the same regard as their older counterparts, but the inferences remain. In fact, media outlets including <em>USA Today</em> and <em>Fortune</em> magazine recently compared the ad to a <em>Hunger Games</em> and <em>Divergent</em>-like dystopia - with no mention of communism parallels at all.

Overall, though, this fast food marketing campaign has the potential to deliver for Taco Bell - as the decided underdog, they're clearly pulling out all the stops to make a name for themselves in the pre-lunchtime race. And while the concept isn’t necessarily the most original (think: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Apple’s <em>1984</em>-inspired Super Bowl commercial for the Macintosh</a>), it does appear to fall in line with the company’s branding strategy. While McDonald’s has been actively trying to shed its image of being over-processed and unhealthy, Taco Bell has no shame in being, well, somewhat of both. Their commercials and promotions, unlike Mickey D’s, don’t include aspects like health benefits or number of calories - quite frankly, no one in the Taco Bell drive-thru is <em>really</em> fretting over how many grams of fat is in a Doritos Locos Taco (the answer: <em>a lot</em>). Taco Bell has built its reputation on putting interesting ingredients inside their popular burritos, catering to the late-night revelers with an affinity for fire sauce. In keeping with their core branding, it just makes sense for Taco Bell to think outside the McMuffin in terms of breakfast food and advertising (perhaps we should go ahead and trademark<em> that</em> one).

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com//contact/"">[blogCTA] Need some strategic direction? [/blogCTA]</a>

Besides, Taco Bell is undoubtedly aware of the fact that we both know I’m not picking up an A.M. Crunch Wrap as a result of it being a balanced way to start my morning; I’m waiting in the drive-thru for my alternative to ""circular sameness"" simply because it just sounds pretty dang good.

Developing a highly effective fast food marketing strategy,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s 2017 and fast food restaurants are starting to catch on: green is in and greasy is out. We’ve all seen the Instagram accounts with millions of followers that only post acai bowls and kale salads. Okay, so what does this mean for fast food restaurants, and more importantly- what does this mean for their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">marketing strategy</a>?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether the menu is organic, locally sourced, or cage-free, it’s clear that the fast casual restaurant model is winning with consumers. The Chipotles and Shake Shacks of the world have revolutionized consumer expectations of what fast food might actually include. With healthier consumer mindsets, companies like McDonald’s will need to place a greater emphasis on the “food”, not just the “fast” when it comes to effective fast food marketng strategies. While we still crave the efficiency that comes with a quick meal, that doesn’t mean that we aren’t compelled to make healthier choices as we take on the world, either. We’ll take a pricier burrito bowl over the $1 menu McChicken if it means feeling good about my eating choices (and sparking jealousy from my followers on Snapchat).</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what are the fast food giants doing to shake things up? For starters, McDonald’s is shifting its philosophy from “billions served” to “billions heard”. Burger King and McDonald’s have added salads to the menu, and Mickey D’s is now serving antibiotic-free chicken, milk from cows not treated with growth hormones, as well as egg white breakfast sandwiches. Not without notice, the company is taking steps to clean up its act, so to speak.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The misstep here, though, is the threat of brand inconsistency when it comes to strategic fast food marketing. Is McDonald’s attempting to ditch their old image, replacing it with the notion that they’ve evolved into the go-to restaurant for quick and mindful meals, or are they clamoring to reach millennials by being unapologetically indulgent? While I’m glad McDonald’s has added more health-conscious items to the menu, and I don’t believe the chain has to lean one way or another in an effort to remain successful on the fast food marketing front, the traditional image they have consistently held is going to be a mighty tough one to shed - and one they shouldn’t be so quick to throw away with that crumpled-up sandwich wrapper. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I don’t think McDonald’s needs to hop aboard the kale and granola, solar-powered train just yet. People still want to indulge, and as long as there’s a 24-hour drive-thru available, hungry Americans are going to continue to crave their Big Mac fix. Not everyone is counting calories or putting spinach in their smoothies; the problem with McDonald’s image may boil down to simple food quality. By bumping-up the perceived quality of their meals (even if it means increasing prices accordingly), aligned with a strategic marketing plan, they may just remedy any residual reputational risk.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hungry to develop a fast food <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">marketing strategy</a> that speaks to today’s consumer? </span><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com//contact/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Contact our team</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to effectively super-size your marketing efforts and deliver messaging that resonates with existing and prospective “grab-a-meal-on-the-go” enthusiasts!</span>",,4/17/2015 8:25,1,http://bigeyeagency.com//wp-content/uploads/2015/04/An-Apple-A-Day-Developing-A-Healthy-Highly-Effective-Fast-Food-Marketing-Strategy.jpg,highly-effective-fast-food-marketing-strategy,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why perfecting the retail marketing mix is important,"Contemporary retail marketing is a brave new world. While some basic principles remain when it comes to implementing effective retail <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategies</a>, others have evolved to acknowledge and appeal to the new breed of consumer. Does your business have what it takes to succeed in today’s dynamic landscape? Let’s take a closer look at three critical components of the 21st century retail marketing mix.
<h3>1. It’s not you, it’s them</h3>
And by “them,” we mean your customers. While the retail marketing mix involves a number of elements -- those trusty, oft-cited “six P's.”  People, product, price, place, promotion and performance should all be focused in one clear direction: your customers.

It goes without saying that your customers are your business' most important constituents, but a shocking number of retail enterprises fail to put them front and center when it comes to developing and implementing retail strategies. Here's the cold hard truth: the more customer-focused you can make your retail business, the more success you can expect to achieve.

Lucky for us, we have more access than ever toward understanding our customers. From tracking in-store footfalls to online conversation rates, the ability to known and learn from customer behavior yields actionable insights into their wants and needs so you can stop wasting your resources on what doesn't work and instead focus on results.

We’re living in an era of “YOU-tility,” and retail organizations are not exempt when it comes to satisfying the contemporary consumer. One common goal shared by today's successful retail enterprises? To add value across all of the P's.  This can mean anything from implementing point of sale solutions for on-the-go customers to targeting promotions to reach a particular demographic via their preferred means of communication, all without bothering the rest with irrelevant promotional materials.
<h3>2. Consistency is key</h3>
We can all agree that a retail organization which only emphasizes sales is destined to fail. Why? Because retail success also relies upon providing extraordinary customer service every step of the way. Want to gain an inside edge on the competition? Don’t settle for delivering what your customers expect. Instead, strive to exceed their expectations. After all, the ultimate goal is <em>not</em> to make a single sale, but to develop lasting customer loyalty, along with the potential for a lifetime of sales.

Because consumer shopping habits have changed, so must your marketing efforts. This means incorporating a complete range of omnichannel marketing methods in order to leverage technology into sales. To maximize your efforts and ensure that your message <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">reaches your target audience</a> in the most meaningful way, your business needs a compelling online and offline presence.

Today’s consumers expect the businesses they support to be transparent, accountable and responsive. While these may sound like trendy buzzwords, they’re a very real part of any successful retail marketing mix. This means every communication you send -- whether in-store or via digital methods  -- is aimed at reinforcing your brand sensibility across all touch points.

And don’t forget about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email</a>. While most people think social media and apps have overtaken email as the ideal means of communicating with consumers, email is still an important way to cultivate and engage consumers. In fact, a recent <em>Inc.</em> article decreed email marketing to be “<a href=""http://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/top-5-reasons-why-email-marketing-is-still-works.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">vital for businesses of all sizes</a>,” for a variety of reasons including its low cost, mobile reach, and impact upon both online and in-store sales.

Consistency also means establishing expectations for your staff and reinforcing these expectations so that organization-wide operations are coordinated, streamlined, and cohesive. Every team member should be working toward the common goal of satisfying customers through a well-communicated strategic plan.
<h3>3. A new kind of location, location, location</h3>
The traditional marketing mix has always emphasized location. After all, you’re not going to make any sales if access to your storefront is limited by a poor, inconvenient or incongruent location in terms of your brand and target consumers. And while your physical storefront remains an important concern today, it’s far from the only concern. Why? Because not only are today’s customers more mobile in terms of where they shop, but they also have access to endless e-commerce options. Shopping is no longer about geography. In fact, today’s consumers can get nearly everything they need without stepping foot inside a brick-and-mortar location. In order to keep up with the evolving retail mix, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce site</a> is as important as your physical storefront when attracting paying customers.

Forrester Research’s report, <a href=""https://www.forrester.com/US+CrossChannel+Retail+Forecast+2012+To+2017/fulltext/-/E-RES105461"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">U.S. Cross-Channel Retail Forecast, 2012-2017</a>, predicts that by the year 2017, 60 percent of the country’s total retail sales will involve the web, and a full 10.3 percent will be online purchases. Unless you’re willing to forgo your 10 percent, creating an inviting, accessible, compelling and brand-centric new ""location"" -- ie. your online storefront -- is a must-do.

While finding the correct retail marketing mix takes some time and effort, it can serve as the difference between standing out from your competition and blending in with the rest. Keeping these three things in mind can help you maximize your retail marketing mix efforts in order to enjoy optimal results across your business, brand, and bottom line.

How to spend your Q3 and Q4 retail marketing dollars,"Whether making a last minute push to meet year-end numbers or simply subscribing to the reality of “use it or lose it,” most retailers pick up the pace when it comes to their Q3 and Q4 marketing methods. Wondering how to aim for and achieve the best possible results? Consider these seven proven ways to maximize your retail marketing allocations.
<h3>1. Better your blog</h3>
Unfortunately, many retail business blogs miss the mark when it comes to achieving their full potential. Why? Because they exist out of a sense of obligation, as opposed to as an extension of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">company's overall business strategy</a>.

Blogs are cost-efficient, highly effective marketing tools….unless they’re left to languish, in which case they offer value to neither you nor your consumers. Conversely, a well-executed blog can help you build engagement and foster consumer loyalty while also enhancing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO rankings</a> and search results. Stop thinking of your blog as your website’s ""ugly stepsister,"" and start thinking of it as more of a fairy godmother of sorts -- with the magical potential to generate sales leads.
<h3>2. Look harder at search engine marketing</h3>
Odds are, you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">promote your website</a> via Search Engine Marketing (SEM) throughout the year. However, did you know that Q3 and Q4 offer the enhanced opportunity to take a closer look at your conversion rates? Are your average costs per lead and conversions meeting your expectations?  If not, consider where your efforts may be failing.

For many organizations, the critical element is poorly-designed landing pages which fail to generate search marketing ROI. After all, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">different campaigns</a> have varying search optimization parameters. Taking the time to customize each campaign can yield powerful results right when you need them.

Also, keep in mind that while starting new campaigns may not yield realizable ROI by year’s end, maximizing your existing processes and programs has the potential to improve outcomes.
<h3>3. Focus on Facebook</h3>
While social media in general presents valuable opportunities for marketers, Facebook takes second place only to Google when it comes to <a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/08/28/facebook-mobile-ad-revenue/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">worldwide net digital ad revenues</a>. When was the last time you evaluated your Facebook advertising approach? Whether you’re looking to cast a wider net or increase sales, Facebook offers a captive audience to savvy advertisers.

Not only that, but Facebook’s robust analytics allow you to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target your audience</a>, choose from different ad formats, and understand your results through reporting, tracking and measuring capabilities. If your marketing efforts are going awry, these metrics can help you take swift, corrective actions.
<h3>4. Go for growth</h3>
While dwindling resources may compel you to trim expenses, it’s also important to keep an eye on the prize: building value. This doesn't necessarily mean cutting costs, but instead amping up accountability. Execution-driven strategies position you to demonstrate the effectiveness of your retail marketing campaigns, and information management is a critical part of the process.

Today’s retail marketers have access to more actionable data than ever before. Demonstrable results are not only essential to assessing ROI, but also to making any last minute adjustments to move forward in the most productive way during retail’s busiest season.
<h3>5. Optimize email efforts</h3>
On that note, heading into the holiday season, it’s particularly important to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">deliver content</a> to consumers via the most appealing and accessible means. While social media gets the lion’s share of attention, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email</a> remains a preference for many in your target market.

But not just any emails. From delivering coupon codes to informing recipients about upcoming in-store and online flash sales, emails can drive both traffic and conversions.

And don’t forget about the importance of mobile. Responsive, aesthetically pleasing email messages can also further optimize Q3 and Q4 outcomes.
<h3>6. Count on content</h3>
The typical 21st century consumer doesn’t want a hard sell; he/she wants value. As consumers prepare to open their pocketbooks during the season of giving, give them a gift of your own: meaningful content that either answers a question or enriches their lives in some essential way.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Content should be consistent</a>, relevant, unique, and focused on making the entire shopping process more accessible and user-friendly. When designing your content strategies during Q3 and Q4, keep in mind that the best content is not about completing a sale, but about telling a story that engages consumers and bolsters your brand.
<h3>7. Cultivate the consumer experience</h3>
We can agree by now that contemporary customers are all about value over hype. With consumer confidence harder to come by than ever before, retail marketers can position themselves for success by earmarking Q3 and Q4 funds for enhancing efforts to understand what motivates their customers and deliver on these insights.

Don’t overlook the power of omni-channel marketing. Relevant real-time content delivered via a consumer’s preferred mode of communication has the potential to increase both sales and consumer engagement.

Finally, Q3 and Q4 also offer an ideal opportunity to nurture your leads. Are you doing everything you can do -- in the most direct, targeted way -- to get better ROI out of your lead generation?

As the calendar year draws to a close, retail marketers are greeted with unprecedented opportunities to put their end-of-year retail marketing dollars to optimal use. These seven techniques are sure to help you focus your marketing efforts where they’re least likely to overdraw your resources -- and most likely to generate ROI.

Top 10 secrets of successful visual merchandising & retail design,"Visual merchandising and retail design don’t just improve the aesthetics of your retail space, but they also have the potential to enhance functionality, customer loyalty and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand identity</a>. Want to ensure that you retail store makes a brilliant first impression, as well as a lasting final one? Use these top 10 visual merchandising and retail design tips and tricks to optimize both space and sales.
<h3>1. Access matters</h3>
A cluttered retail floor is not only unattractive, it’s confusing to the consumer. Prioritize a clean and simple layout above all else when it comes to designing your store. The easier it is for consumers to navigate your space, the more time they’ll spend in your store. A cramped space with insufficient passage, conversely, can quickly send customers packing.

Remember: the ultimate goal is a welcoming space, so forego ""don't touch"" signs and instead invite shoppers to touch and interact with your display.

Lastly, keep in mind that today's customers have brief attention spans. Place items at varying heights, and create visual breaks between long, product packed aisles to help maintain their attention of easily-distracted shoppers.
<h3>2. Reduce visual clutter</h3>
Clutter isn’t just a matter of physical space. It can also manifest in the form of excessive and overwhelming marketing displays. Rather than barraging your customers with multiple marketing displays, take a streamlined approach. For example, if you’re advertising many different products, consider implementing a rotating digital display board. This has the added potential advantage of drawing a customer’s eye to an item or deal he/she might otherwise have missed.

Factor in the latest research indicating that a whopping <a href=""http://marketingland.com/survey-90-percent-of-retail-shoppers-use-smartphones-in-stores-135759"">90 percent of in-store shoppers use their mobile devices in stores</a>, and the task becomes less about inundating them with information and more about giving them the means to access this information for themselves -- a particularly appealing prospect for today’s “just Google it” Millennial generation.
<h3>3. Catch their attention</h3>
Reducing visual clutter doesn’t mean forsaking all color and style. Rather, it means incorporating well-cultivated display pieces designed to attract customer attention in a unique way. It’s not about inundating consumers with everything you have to offer, but instead about highlighting particularly relevant or compelling items. Avoid monochromatic displays. Color -- particularly bold blacks, whites, and reds -- <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">quickly attracts attention</a>.

Take Target, for example. Its signature red is such a principle part of its logo, lettering, and store decor that the company has trademarked it.

Or consider this: consumers are 15 percent less likely to return to stores with orange color schemes than with blue color schemes.

Heinz EZ Squirt Blastin' Green ketchup, meanwhile, is a perfect example of how color can drive sales. In the switch from red to green, Heinz experienced historically high sales -- a whopping $23 million over seven months.

Additionally, many visual merchandisers and retail designers find planogram software to be particularly useful for gaining a better understanding of how the space will look.

Once you've captured their attention, don't risk losing it by leaving off price tags. Consumers hate having to request a price, so make sure all stock prices are well-displayed.
<h3>4. Tell a story</h3>
Establishing product segment areas -- from pet supplies to paper goods -- not only helps shoppers understand the landscape, but also encourages them to stock up on related goods. But that’s just the beginning. Establishing narrative “themes” adds both practical and inviting appeal. By setting up a coffee-themed display, for example, you not only appeal to shoppers' needs, but also to their sensibilities. Use a variety of display props -- from tables to wall fixtures to shelving -- to keep things interesting while showcasing your wares.

Take Chick-fil-A's #CoffeeWithAStory <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a>, for example. Not only has the brand constructed an appealing narrative around the role coffee plays in our lives, but it also prioritizes engagement by inviting consumers to share their own experiences via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
<h3>5. Exceed their needs</h3>
A bookstore sells books. A pet store sells pet supplies. A hair salon sells hair and beauty treatments. While these models may have worked 20 years ago, today’s consumers are looking for something more. Bookstores which offer coffee bars and reading areas, pet stores with pet bakery counters and “puppy playdate” sessions, and hair salons that also sell jewelry and other small accessories invite shoppers to stay longer and buy more. By embracing creativity and ""thinking outside the box,"" enterprising retail businesses build customer loyalty while also generating new streams of revenue.
<h3>6. Front and center</h3>
Your store window, along with the front area of your store, is essential for enticing foot traffic to venture inside. Not only should you keep <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">new merchandise</a> front and center, but you should also highlight trademark products to reinforce your brand identity and foster a sense of familiarity and trust among shoppers.

And don't underestimate the value of proper lighting: people are drawn to light. A well-lit entry or display not only makes merchandise more appealing but also beckons to passersby.

Meanwhile, the days of enduring long lines at store entrances and exits are long gone. Rather, a centrally located checkout counter delivers immediate convenience. Stock the surrounding areas with frequently purchased goods to encourage impulse buys. Better yet? Incorporate point of sale solutions to help shoppers buy what they want when they want it while streamlining operations.
<h3>7. Build your brand</h3>
Visual merchandising and retail design aren’t just about deciding what goes where. They also deliver a valuable opportunity to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">reinforce your brand identity</a>. Consider popular stores like Apple, Anthropologie, and Lululemon. These stores aren't just selling products, but a lifestyle. By linking the look of your store with your products, you make a strong, consistent brand statement with which shoppers will identify.

Conversely, the failure of the JCPenney's widely publicized reboot is largely attributed to lack of culture and the resulting dearth of brand experience. In short, your visual merchandizing and retail design efforts are part of delivering on your promise to consumers.
<h3>8. Stop shoplifters</h3>
Beyond building brand identity and boosting sales, savvy store design is also an effective deterrent for shoplifters. Make sure store employees have clear sight lines of the entire space.
<h3>9. Be dynamic</h3>
Customers are enticed by attractive displays, but the same tired display windows and tables have the opposite effect. To keep things fresh, frequently rotate your displays. If sales on a particular item are lagging, meanwhile, strategically mix them in with the latest arrivals to give them new life.

Also, when deciding on new displays, focus on relevance based upon recent purchase trends, seasonality, and new inventory in order to best match customer needs with your strategic business imperatives.
<h3>10. Play to wants, not needs</h3>
Many customers come into your store to buy a particular item. Odds are, they’ll leave with that item regardless of your visual merchandising and retail design efforts. Rather than highlighting these obvious, need-based buys, focus your efforts on showcasing wants, instead. After all, a shopper can't make an impulse purchase without first being confronted with an unexpected and irresistibly appealing product.

Ultimately, the look and feel of your store has as much weight in the success of your business strategy as the products and services you proffer. By incorporating these 10 key visual merchandising and retail design techniques, you can enhance the shopper experience, while lending invaluable benefits to bottom line.

To Target: Retail lessons learned from the Lilly Pulitzer collab.,"Bonafide “Lilly Lovers” arrived in droves in the wee hours of the morning. Decked out in shades of varying pastels, they came, they shopped, they conquered.

A lucky few were even fortunate enough to walk away with coveted pieces from the recent <a href=""http://www.target.com/c/lilly-pulitzer-for-target-brand-shop/-/N-4ymap"">Lilly Pulitzer for Target</a> collaboration. Others returned to their local stores’ packed parking lots – many after waiting in lines reminiscent of Black Friday electronics extravaganzas – without a preppy, patterned shift dress in sight. And that was just the brick and mortar side of the story.

Online, shoppers set alarm clocks, filled social media group chats in anticipation, and highlighted favorites from the pre-launch release of the Lilly <a href=""http://fashionista.com/2015/03/lilly-pulitzer-for-target-lookbook"">“look book”</a> at Target.com, long before the much buzzed about website launch on April 19, 2015. The moment the site went live – at approximately 1:00am EST, a similar fashionista frenzy ensued.

Admittedly, that was yours truly. In my pj’s, hardly able to sleep a wink – MacBook in one hand, iPhone in the other, trying to take it all in (and with a little dose of Lilly luck, hoping to end up with at least one Nosey Posie printed item in my shopping cart). And my lust wasn’t limited to women’s and children’s clothing – also included in the collection were a bevy of cute collectible housewares, ranging from pillows to folding beach chairs, and oh, did I mention cosmetic cases? So, why all of the hullabaloo surrounding an existing brand’s capsule collection? Moreover, why the unbridled excitement for a brand that was founded six decades ago?

<em>AdWeek </em>hit the nail on the bow-adorned head when it comes to retail lessons learned, “Target may have partnered with high-end brands in the past, but Lilly Pulitzer is the first old-guard, social-register brand to sign on, and <em>that</em> makes a big difference.” You’ve got that right. It might just be the brand’s iconic status, and Jackie Kennedy-inspired longevity that actually helped to generate the social buzz to begin with. While some fans - many willing to pay full price in a retail store - were none too pleased at the thought of their treasures potentially “degrading the brand” with a wholesale-style partnership, most “bargainistas” rejoiced wholeheartedly.

In case you find yourself scratching your forehead in full-on preppy puzzlement, here’s a little backgrounder on <a href=""https://www.lillypulitzer.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=OurStory"">The Lilly Story</a>. Pulitzer, the brand’s founder and namesake was a prominent socialite who, in 2013, passed away as an heiress to the Standard Oil fortune, after first marrying into the renowned Pulitzer publishing family. According to <em>AdWeek</em>, Pulitzer found herself, “stranded and bored in her Palm Beach manse in 1959, and decided she needed something to keep herself busy, so she opened a fruit juice stand on Worth Avenue. To hide the stains from the oranges and grapefruits she was squeezing, Pulitzer found some colorful cotton prints and made a shift dress from it.” And there you have it: a fashion success story is born. Palm Beachers embraced the printed frocks, the brand soon expanded, resulting in store openings throughout South Florida, and eventually spreading across the East Coast. Shortly thereafter, Jackie O was photographed in a custom Lilly, only further catapulting the company’s popularity.

Return to current day, and “Pink Sunday” as it was affectionately labeled, and the marketing success of the Lilly for Target collab just simply cannot be underscored. According to Roy DeYoung, senior vp of creative strategy for PM Digital, “History is the reason people lined up—they want the Lilly Pulitzer at a good price, and they know it'll be good, if not exceptional quality, with Target for the price point,"" said DeYoung. ""But they also know it'll go fast. Target makes an event out of doing these deals and collaborations every couple of years, and to sell out like this, it's a circus."" Cue the “under the bigtop” theme music.

Starting with the initial online reveal via <a href=""http://www.refinery29.com/2015/01/80347/new-target-lilly-pulitzer-designer-collaboration-2015"">Refinery 29</a>, and culminating with the aforementioned “look book,” Target rounded out the juggernaut with a commercial spot featuring “the most lavish pool party ever, complete with the likes of Jay Gatsby.” Take a gander at the commercial - (featuring Chris Noth, or Mr. Big for all you SATC fans) - here. I mean honestly, who <em>wouldn’t</em> want to attend a lavish Lilly shindig...or at least look perfectly polished and impeccably dressed like the attendees?

Given the buzz, not only did fans line up by the hundreds outside of Target locations nationwide, but racks were emptied in mere minutes. Those waiting in the wee hours at home in their jammies didn’t fail to disappoint either. As a result, the company’s website was not equipped to handle the mass hysteria of online traffic, inaccessible just moments after the mere early leak of links to merchandise went viral. Feverishly clicking on anything and everything that they could (present company included), frustration peaked quickly – and spread voraciously – across social media circles, forcing the retailer to issue repeated apologetic tweets to the frantic masses.

With such an overwhelming response – most certainly any retailer’s dream come true - the hot pink elephant in the room is definitely whether or not the laws of supply and demand apply for a limited edition, capsule collection. Is the budgeted retail marketing build-up and buzz worth the potential to upset shoppers (many of whom possess money to spend) when limited product supply leaves so many empty-handed, - making it more the norm that the exception? With no limit to the number of items a consumer was permitted to purchase, the only restriction for Lilly for Target shoppers in this case included a limited 14-day return policy for pieces from the collaboration.

According to <em>USA TODAY</em>, this reaction is not atypical of past collabs, as items included in these “for Target” collections are often seen as collectors’ items, fetching more than double the regular retail price on auction sites such as eBay. Not so coincidentally, when Target launched its Missoni line in 2011, the Italian designer’s fan base reacted in the exact same fashion (pun intended), lining-up, clearing shelves, and crashing the retailer’s website as quickly as items flew off the in-store racks. Shortly after the launch, Lifestyle blogger Stacy Geisinger summed it up bluntly: “Target failed,” she said. “Their website crashed. So much promotion and not enough product. They could have made a fortune. Instead they have many disappointed customers.”

From a fiscal perspective, does a short-order offer in limited supply, with perceived value well beyond the price tag, really make it worthwhile to both the retailer <em>and</em> the consumer? It clearly does if you’re a seller on eBay. For example, Lilly Pulitzer beach towels, retail priced at $25 each, were listed on the ecommerce site for a starting bid of $50, or a “buy it now” price of $250 for a set of four. Yikes.

Buyer backlash hasn’t ended there - soon after Pink Sunday, a movement started on Facebook to boycott such inflated prices. The group’s profile reads: “Boycott eBay sellers who are marking up Lilly by Target after clearing shelves of merchandising only to turn a profit.” Just like the Missoni launch, limited Lilly supply caused gross consumer demand, with shoppers hoarding as many items as possible into a single shopping cart. Make that more than one in some cases. I can attest to groggily waiting in line prior to my store’s opening, making small talk with a married couple behind me, and listening in as the begrudging husband was given a mandated Lilly housewares “honey-do” shopping list. Who needs to be limited to a single cart?

While some may disagree, I think the reward might just outweigh the risk, or perhaps that’s because I emerged victorious both online <em>and</em> in-store. To paraphrase a tweet from a fellow Lilly Lover, “I might not have scored every item I’d been eyeing on my Lilly for Target wish list, but I did wake on Monday feeling triumphant in the spoils of my labor.” Amen, sister. <em>Amen. </em>

Would I allow myself to subsist on a mere two hours of sleep again in the name of fashion? Maybe not. Well, I guess that all depends on Target’s next designer collaboration. As Lilly herself once said, “Anything is possible with sunshine - and a little pink.”

Millennial market: Property management marketing the new generation,"As you are likely aware, rent costs have spiked nearly 15% since 2010, while mortgage interest rates are at new lows after the recession. Yet believe it or not, millennials are still happily paying an average of $1300-$1500 (or more) for rent month after month, with no property equity to show for it. There are many reasons why millennials are opting to rent instead of buy, and to successfully market to this generation, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> would like to share the following helpful hints to assist you in gaining a greater understanding of those reasons:
<h3>Know who you're talking to:</h3>
There are <a href=""http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/millennials/"">92 million millennials in the United States</a>. Collectively, they have over <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-debt-state-of-the-union-2016-1"">1.3 trillion dollars of student loan debt</a>, may have spent a few years living with their parents or friends when the recession hit, and are bouncing back from <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"">4.7% national unemployment rates</a>. On a brighter note, financial conditions are improving for the 20- and 30-something set, and many are finding themselves ready to cut loose and enjoy a breath of fresh air.

Apartment living can represent that much sought-after breath of fresh air. When older generations explain what the “American Dream” means to them, they often cite owning property or putting down roots. Millennials may include having luxury amenities they wouldn’t be able to afford if they owned a home, such as valet parking, a pool, free gyms or billiard rooms, or a building concierge. Couple these attributes with easy access to food, nightlife, arts, and entertainment in the heart of most urban hubs. American Dream, indeed.

To millennials, the prospect of a 30-year mortgage translates to staying in one place - in one job - for the next three decades. This is a generation that can barely commit to two-year cell phone contracts. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">Marketing campaigns</a> mapping out this generation’s lifespan aren’t liberating, they’re terrifying. Marketing campaigns that highlight the freedom of renting (or owning a secondary rental property as an extra income stream) – now that’s something.
<h3>Speak their language:</h3>
Successful property management marketing hinges on your ability to speak this generation’s language. Communicating with millennials the same way you would to the Baby Boomer generation is sure to leave your apartment marketing a little flat. This generation wants to live in locations where homeownership may be out of reach, or they may not be ready to get married and settle down yet - making homeownership a necessity.

The mistake most people make when marketing to millennials is that they assume the Y-generation is unhappy with this arrangement. Goldman Sachs conducted a study that suggests 30% of millennials believe buying a home is important … just not right now. A similar study  shows more than <a href=""http://candysdirt.com/2016/04/20/millennials-want-to-buy-a-home/"">79% of renters between the ages of 18 – 35 want to buy a home within the next five years</a>. That means these renters are content being, well, renters until then. But what does that mean for property managers?

In highly desirable locations, such as San Francisco, Denver, or New York City, that means it’s an owner’s market. Even if millennials were ready to buy, high down payments, aggressive credit requirements, and staggering debt to income ratios make this prospect difficult. Property managers that give millennials access to apartments with high-perceived value will win their hearts, and since most renters pay up to 30% of their disposable income in rent according to <a href=""http://www.zillow.com/"">Zillow</a>, you’ll also have access to a large piece of their business.

Vacancy rates are at a 20-year low according to the American Census Bureau, so property marketing that targets exclusivity and accessibility to desirable locations is crucial for success.
<h3>Know your niche:</h3>
For millennials, you want to highlight value not price. Chances are, they know they aren’t saving as much as they’d like or that their paycheck is going to their landlord rather than their student loan holders. Successful property management marketing ideas highlight the value they are getting - despite the cost.

Since millennials are choosing to marry later in life, play up your apartment property’s sense of community and camaraderie. Talk about the convenience of having an on-site property manager to take care of (and pay for routine maintenance and upkeep). Highlight convenient month-to-month options that let millennials dream about their next job promotion to Singapore or London. Boast your building’s free wifi or cable packages that make working remotely or being an entrepreneur a breeze (working by the pool sounds pretty great to us).

Once you begin to understand a millennial’s version of the American Dream, you can begin positioning your property management marketing around those elements. Chances are, they’ll be substantially different from customers in other generations, but that doesn’t mean this market segment is less valuable. In fact, <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/home-ownership-millennials-could-jump-housing-market-2016-2244360"">millennials make up about 36% of the housing market in the United States</a>, making them the predominant generation in the industry.
<h3>The long and short game:</h3>
The short game for millennials is all about renting. The long game, however, appeals to their desire to buy. The economy is improving, interest rates are low, and sooner or later, millennials will begin tying the knot, having kids, and settling in to their mid-level careers.

Once you’ve proven that you understand them, they will remain loyal to you as their needs change. Some millennials will likely stay in the apartment market, opting to convert their rent to a mortgage payment on a condo or flat in the neighborhoods where they first started their careers and barely scraped by. Others will ""head for the hills"" – or suburbia – for a little more space and lower housing costs. As they grow, your marketing campaigns can grow with them.

Millennials are also poised to become some of the biggest buyers in the second and vacation property market. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) noted a staggering drop in the average age of vacation home purchasers. The market that used to be saturated with retirees with an average purchase age of 61 has plummeted to 43. As millennials watch their siblings turn a profit on vacation properties, and sites such as VRBO.com, HomeAway.com, and AirBnB.com make vacation rentals more accessible as a secondary source of income, millennials will flock to these opportunities as a way to – you guessed it – further harness their own financial freedom.

Millennials are very different from other generations, but understanding and marketing to them isn’t as difficult as you think. After all, everyone wants a beautiful space to come home to at the end of the day – no matter what generation you’re in.

BIGEYE selected as Bronze winner At the 36th Annual Telly Awards,"<strong>Orlando, Florida</strong> <strong>– June 23, 2015 –</strong> <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">BIGEYE</a>, a fully integrated advertising agency based in Orlando, Florida, has been selected as a Bronze winner in the 36th Annual Telly Awards for their piece entitled, “Howard Phillips Center: Children’s Advocacy Center Video.""<b> </b>The competition included nearly 12,000 entries from all 50 states, and numerous countries.

The Children’s Advocacy Center (CAC) at The Howard Phillips Center for Children unites police officers, school officials, nurses, and doctors to protect and investigate children who have been victims of child abuse. With the main goal of preventing re-victimization of children, the CAC provides assessment, advocacy, and therapy services to abused and neglected children. Despite the overarching sadness associated with abuse and neglect, the organization requested a video that combats these emotions, serving to provide encouragement, positivity, and inspiration, and its catalyst stemmed from the results of a children’s art project featured in the Center. Like flowers that may wither away without water and sunshine, children without CAC may not recover without its services.

You say you want a revolution? Here comes apple music,"So far, the reaction has been “mostly good” for Apple Music, its new streaming service that debuted June 30.

And, knowing how easy Apple products are to adapt to, many early bugs will either be squashed quickly, or people will soon find themselves willing to learn to live with these minor technological hiccups.

Certainly not everyone is going to like it instantly, such as loyalists to Spotify or Pandora, two streaming services that stand to lose market share. Don’t forget the legion of Taylor Swift enthusiasts, who are proud of her request for artists to be paid. (Apple blinked first on that one, but still included her tunes in its library.)

There was an initial kerfuffle about Beats Music not being all that it was cracked up to be. Or really not having anything at all that some consumers want, besides some “recommended music.” Wired business columnist <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/06/paid-beats-apple-music-broken-promise/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Marcus Wohlsen</a> even went so far as to call Beats a “broken promise.”

Other feedback on its first day was generally positive – customers liked how you can push one button to request “more music like this.” The “heart”/like feature is a useful one, and the recommendations for music based on where you are, what you’re doing and what your mood is also sounds like it has potential. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">new social network</a>, Connect, is a little bit of an unknown – music can be a great conversation starter or discussion topic, and it’s all right there, but some users may not be ready to get involved with yet another social channel.

As <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/30/mainstreaming-music/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TechCrunch</a> describes the service, it’s for “people with no clue what to stream.”

But being Apple, integration/sharing between your other iWhatever products will likely be seamless – iPads, iPhones, Powerbooks, desktops, TV and iCloud storage. The three-month free trial also won’t hurt any and will let people take their time exploring and hopefully they won’t want to give it up when the free ride ends.

Another encouraging sign is how businesses can get involved.

Apple’s <a href=""http://advertising.apple.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">iAd program</a> has always made it easy to create an ad campaign, select a budget and target certain Apple users on different platforms or in different demographic groups.

Advertisers are invited to take part in Radio on Apple Music, which offers different channels of different types of music. Audio and video ad slots are available, which can appeal to different types of listeners – those who pick a channel and let the music play continuously in the background, or those who are actively monitoring their selections and channels The Radio on Apple Music advertiser ads can be shown to users beyond the radio channels, including while browsing or playing music, shopping, reading, chatting or using different Apple products.

Having access to Radio might be a great tool for advertisers in knowing even more about their audience. Along with traditional fields like age, location and general interests, Apple can connect advertisers with users who have indicated they like certain types of music and dislike others. The audio and/or video messages can also be shared across different devices.

Restaurant marketing strategies to encourage real reviews,"<span style=""color: #000000;"">Social media, travel, and review sites can be a great testament to your business’s credibility, customer service, amenities, and experiences. The problem is, most people only write reviews when they’ve had a shockingly horrific experience, or were completely blown away by something. But how do you encourage the masses of happy, satisfied customers in between those two spectrums to write reviews? A great place to start is with a well-devised approach- be it in terms of marketing your restaurant, or promoting your hotel, resort, or tourist attraction.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">The formula is simple. Whenever you make a request of your customer – whether it’s asking for an email address or seeking a review – you must be certain that you give them something of equal value in return. Simple campaigns that exchange real value for real reviews will bring your existing customers closer to your brand, while in turn, generating new reach within your target audience. Here, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> shares the following quick and easy recommendations - in case you were in need of a little added inspiration:</span>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">For restaurants and bars</span></h3>
If there’s one thing you need to know, it’s that locals are truly your best friends. Use this to your advantage by employing restaurant marketing strategies that encourage local reviews. Attract your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">seasonal audience</a> by engaging restaurant review sites such as Yelp and OpenTable. Host “locals’ nights” and offer a free appetizer to anyone who writes a review. Invite reviewers to preview new menu items or cocktail variations on the house … in exchange for a review, of course. Chances are, your reviewers will want to come back for more … tell their friends … or maybe even spread the word to those random tourists they bumped into on the street.

While some restaurants and bars host trivia night. Take things to the next level with your approach to restaurant marketing by hosting your very own branded “social media night.” <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Tweet-ups, meet-ups, and other social gatherings</a> are hugely popular. Get people in the door by offering discounts, free bites, or some form of entertainment. Plan these activities on your traditionally slower evenings to boost business you wouldn’t otherwise have  - and to encourage all your guests to review, post, and Instagram away. Possible prize offerings may be awarded for tweets and reviews, or simply let people generate their own buzz around your business.
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"">For hotels and resorts</span></h3>
<span style=""color: #000000;"">Offer customers a deep discount or give them one night free for a good review. Chances are, your guests will stay longer than one night, and will be so pleased with their “free” vacation they’ll be more inclined to make up the difference in food and beverage costs or on-site amenities. If you’re worried people will ""game the system,"" put straightforward terms and conditions around the offer to limit one freebie per household. (This will ensure that the reviewer was a visitor within the past six months.) You’ll get a great review  - and some extra business in the process.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Another option is to create a brand ambassador program. Use a point or discount system to reward guests for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">meaningful social media posts, photos, and reviews</a>. This strategy may promote quantity over quality, so consider using an “application” process that asks potential brand ambassadors why they’d be a great fit, and what unique social media skills they bring to the table.</span>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"">For tourist attractions</span></h3>
<span style=""color: #000000;"">Most travel destinations boast a host of unique activities. You can’t miss swimming with the dolphins in Mexico. Wine tasting in France or Surfing lessons in California. And most of these activities are prime photo opportunities. But as you might have experienced for yourself, even the most seasoned selfie-taker has trouble capturing these moments from the <i>perfect</i> angle. At the end of each activity, guests begrudgingly head toward the photo stand, where professional photography of their adventure is on display. Sneakily, some guests may attempt to covertly snap a copy on their phone, while many visitors simply choose not to purchase these photos on principle. If you offer one digital copy in exchange for a review (which can be easily emailed after the review is verified), you are creating a currency your customers genuinely value. There’s no overhead cost to you, and consequently, plenty of opportunity for gain. </span>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Because most tourist attractions are one-off experiences that come with a premium price tag, providing discounts on future visits may not be the best strategy. Most often, this is due in part to the low volume of repeat customers. Instead, let your guests give the gift of their memories to others. Let them know that when they write a review, they have the opportunity to share a meaningful discount with a friend. This technique perpetuates your business and makes your customers feel good for reviewing you, while also sharing something with their friends and family. That’s what we call a win-win.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">Did these strategies peak your interest when it comes to encouraging your valued customers to share more about their dynamic, memorable experience with your brand?

The science of restaurant menu design and what you need to know,"It's no secret that restaurant branding - specifically in terms of restaurant menu design -  is truly an art form. Be it unique, exquisite, quirky, or reminiscent of the latest fad in bringing the scrumptiously delicious to life, there's much to be appreciated about menus that possess that special quality. Think of it as a certain creative ingredient (or perhaps an entire recipe) that only serves to elevate a pleasurable dining experience - even if from the very first brand interaction.

Below, we bring you 5 outstanding restaurant menus, and why we believe they're prime examples of complete culinary design genius at work:
<h3>Brass union</h3>
I love everything about this concept! I’m such a mark for industrial-style design and you can’t get much more industrial than menus made to look like invoices straight out of a 70’s-era brake pad factory. The layout is straightforward and easy to navigate, and the descriptions of the items aren’t too long and complex. Overall, this menu doesn’t look very daunting when it’s first presented to you. For authenticity’s sake, I hope these menus are printed on a dot-matrix printer.
<div style=""display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;""><a style=""margin-right: 75px;"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brass_01.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-9984"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brass_01-196x300.jpg"" alt=""Brass Union"" width=""196"" height=""300"" /></a><a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brass_02.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-9983"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/brass_02-196x300.jpg"" alt=""Brass Union"" width=""196"" height=""300"" /></a></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>Some burros</h3>
Who doesn’t enjoy bright and friendly colors paired with bold, hand drawn lines? This menu design makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I like that the only actual menu descriptions are specific to this brand's speciality items. It definitely helps to keeps the clutter to a minimum - and let’s be honest…it’s Mexican food. If you don’t know what a taco is, then I pity you.
<div style=""display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;""><a style=""margin-right: 75px;"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/someburros_PHOTO_04.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10015 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/someburros_PHOTO_04-200x300.jpg"" alt=""someburros_PHOTO_04"" width=""200"" height=""300"" /></a><a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/someburros_PHOTO_05.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10016 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/someburros_PHOTO_05-200x300.jpg"" alt=""someburros_PHOTO_05"" width=""200"" height=""300"" /></a></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>Black tap</h3>
<strong>
</strong>It’s so easy to get minimalist design wrong, but this team got it oh so right. The flow of this design is great because what this restaurant does best is placed front and center. I’ve been to so many restaurants that bury their signature items deep in the menu, and I’ve never understood why they do so. If you are known for a signature dish (or even have it in your name), then it makes perfect sense to ensure that it's a cinch to locate on the menu.
<div style=""display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;""><a style=""margin-right: 75px;"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/black_tap_PDF_01.gif""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10009 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/black_tap_PDF_01-182x300.gif"" alt=""black_tap_PDF_01"" width=""182"" height=""300"" /></a> <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/black_tap_PDF_02.gif""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10007 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/black_tap_PDF_02-182x300.gif"" alt=""black_tap_PDF_02"" width=""182"" height=""300"" /></a></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>Made</h3>
The ingenuity of this menu is to be applauded. The design team kept the actual look of the menu simple so that the experience of going through the menu is what stands out to the restaurant patron. It’s so intelligently thought out -  brunch, side items, and drinks take up the least amount of room so they are up front, while lunch has a larger selection, followed by dinner (which typically has the largest selection overall). This menu just begs to be explored, no matter what time of the day you are visiting the restaurant.
<div style=""display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;""><a style=""margin-right: 75px;"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/made_PHOTO_03.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10012 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/made_PHOTO_03-300x200.jpg"" alt=""made_PHOTO_03"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></a> <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/made_PHOTO_01.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10010 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/made_PHOTO_01-300x200.jpg"" alt=""made_PHOTO_01"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></a></div>
&nbsp;
<h3>Salty’s</h3>
When I’m going to a seafood restaurant, this is the kind of menu I want to see. The illustrations are great, and the overall feel of the brand definitely reminds me of the beach. The menu being rubber-banded to the wood backing board is a nice touch, too. Overall, the presentation is an inexpensive, easy way to make a customer feel perceived value in their meal, all while enhancing their dining experience.
<div style=""display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;""><a style=""margin-right: 75px;"" href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/saltys_PHOTO_05.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10014 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/saltys_PHOTO_05-261x300.jpg"" alt=""saltys_PHOTO_05"" width=""261"" height=""300"" /></a> <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/saltys_PHOTO_03.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10013 alignnone"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/saltys_PHOTO_03-300x214.jpg"" alt=""saltys_PHOTO_03"" width=""300"" height=""214"" /></a></div>

7 interesting content ideas for good bank marketing,"To some, banks may seem by nature a tad on the boring side. How much fun can it be, really, to collect and distribute money all day?

Actually, if you talk to people in the profession, it can be a whole lot of fun to be in the business of marketing dollars and cents to the masses. You have the opportunity to assist individuals and businesses alike with their finances, offer loans to help personal and professional dreams come true, and teach customers of all ages the philosophical and tangible benefits of saving money. Employees also agree the now infamous mantra of ""banker's hours,"" coupled with the stability, and agreeable compensation, adds up to a winning combination.

A bank’s blog can be an excellent place to show the world that while your location may not be as wacky and wild as a theme park, at least the perception by customers and employees is that it is a hugely interesting place to be. A good bank marketing team has the potential to devise plenty of useful, entertaining and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO-friendly</a> content that readers will enjoy - and hopefully even share - on social media.

While creating so much captivating content on the regular has the potential to be quite time consuming, if you’re someone who also finds banking enjoyable, it won’t be too hard to find all sorts of interesting topics to share.

Here are 7 interesting content ideas with the proven potential for good bank marketing payoff:
<h3>Definitions</h3>
Your average consumer may understand the basics of savings or checking accounts, but may not know much more. So a blog post that explains concepts like how interest is compounded could be of great use. This education could cover everything from a basic savings account rate to higher rates on larger loans. It could also talk about the industry’s traditions and processes – people love learning about how and why about any unfamiliar industry as long as things don’t get too complex.
<h3>Community efforts</h3>
Local and national banks are often encouraged to raise money for charity. This could be for a project supported by the entire organization as a whole, or via an area fund-raiser. A blog can describe fundraising efforts taking place, how customers may become involved and contribute, or as a means of ""show and tell"" for how well an event was executed.
<h3>Focus on employees</h3>
A great way to offer a personal connection to customers is to highlight the staff. Perhaps on a weekly basis, share a profile about a different employee – how long they've been employed with your institution, what they like about the branch or company, their general interests, or maybe even a helpful financial tip or two or their favorite financial product. Featuring your employees has the potential to double as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content that educates consumers services offered</a>, or special promotions, within a specific branch. Employees will really engage and become excited when its their turn to be a headliner.
<h3>Focus on customers</h3>
Another way for people to feel connected is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">public recognition</a>. If you have longtime, reliable customers, you should include an occasional post about them. With so many choices for banking out there, people might be curious why someone chose a particular institution for his/her personal or business needs. Your customer service staff may know, or you can request testimonials via mail, online, or in-branch comment cards.
<h3>Financial literacy strategies</h3>
Financial assistance is always appreciated at all stages of someone’s life, from a child trying to learn the basics of saving, to teens with their first checkbook, to college students trying to balance a budget for the first time. Couples and new families always welcome solid advice, in the same manner as people approaching retirement age and beyond.
<h3>The value of banks</h3>
With much continued financial uncertainty, consumers are bombarded with suggestions for everything from local credit unions, to investment advisors, to gold merchants. If feel strongly that banks remain the smartest solution for the consumer or business owner, tell why. Odds are, there is an audience that's waiting to receive your message loudly and clearly.
<h3>Analysis of larger financial topics</h3>
Along with educating readers about your local branch office's activities and banking in general, an author can serve to better explain finance-related news stories, and their potential impact on local customers. Recent examples might include Greece’s bailout, or Puerto Rico’s default. Conclude each post with an encouraging thought or anecdote about the importance of money management.

Interestingly, the banking industry as a whole may be going “back to boring,” at least according to the predictions made by <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-02-20/the-new-boring-banking"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bloomberg. </a> After years of banks trying earnestly to be anything and everything to all levels of customers, plus offering all sorts of products and financial services not necessarily related to basic transactions, the industry may be trying to find its way again by slimming down - and focusing on critical needs first. So now, is better time than ever to begin a blog explaining this new shift.

Looking for more riveting content ideas to increase deposit and loan growth - and introduce the ""fun"" side of your bank's brand to your current and prospective customers? <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact us</a> today for a dose of added creativity!",,10/8/2015 11:14,26,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blogheader2.jpg,7-interesting-content-ideas-for-good-bank-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Seven smart ways banks can utilize paid ad campaigns,"It would be oh so simple for a bank to forgo newer methods of communicating - such as social media.

After all, to someone less familiar with social networks like Facebook and Twitter, these online channels all seem like places where people personally love to play, not conduct or discuss serious business. And financial institutions - especially the ones that have been around for awhile - often like to uphold a solid, traditional image, far from anything hip and trendy.

Unfortunately, as any teen or twenty-something can tell you – or maybe <em>should</em> be telling your institution’s decision-makers – today and tomorrow’s customers are actually the ones spending time on these networks. Like it or not, they’re the audience banks need to connect with - to some extent - if you want to remain profitable. If you manage your brand properly and tell your story well, you can still use modern platforms and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search engines</a> as outreach tools to describe your longevity and values. The difference is, you need to show your current and prospective customer that your institution is not only in touch, but also looking toward the future.

Beyond a basic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media presence</a>, or hoping users “like” or follow your bank’s activities, your bank marketing ideas should also consist of spending money for additional exposure. Most larger social networks and search engines now encourage businesses to pay to put their messages in front of more people, or at least target different demographic groups of potential customers.

Like many other industries, bank marketers also have the ability find other ways to purchase advertising, whether it’s buying common keywords that customers may use when conducting a search, or running online ads designed for a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">specific target audience</a>. Though budgets may reflect a preference toward financial marketing approaches that are low to no-cost, in the current online economy, you are definitely able to obtain a farther reach – and likely a better return – if you're willing to make the investment in a paid ad campaign.

Here are 7 smart ways banks can utilize these paid ad campaigns to generate the greatest ROI

<strong>Facebook audiences won’t see everything you put out there</strong> - The actual number is a little vague, and depends on your audience, in tandem with Facebook’s method of determining what individual users see. While<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/marketing/posts/10150839503836337"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> Facebook</a> states that your audience will organically see just 16 percent of your posts, no matter how interesting or clever you make them, other media professionals and search experts say this figure may be <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/locowise-march-2015/619104"">as low as 2.27 percent for pages with more than 500,000 likes</a>. (If ""organic"" is a new term for your marketing team when used in this context, it describes how people come across your information naturally, on their news feeds. Your inorganic reach means that you can pay a bit extra to have more seen by a larger audience.) Facebook offers a variety of payment options, from a small daily amount over time for a certain-sized audience to larger amounts designed to reach more people.

<strong>Consider boosting</strong> - Along with creating a paid campaign for your news feed to be seen by a larger target demographic, Facebook business page owners also have the option to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/help/547448218658012"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">pay to boost the reach of individual posts</a>, placing them higher in people’s regular news feeds. This could be handy for a particular promotion, event, or contest. It also is a good tool to measure the amount of traffic with or without boosts for similar campaigns. If you see a noticeable spike in participation – such as actual new business and “real life” customer activity -- it could be a good indicator that investing in boosting truly attains tangible results.

<strong>Frequency works</strong> - Just like the old adage states that a marketer shouldn’t buy an old-school newspaper, radio, or TV ad for only one day for an ongoing campaign, it is also advised that you not run a Facebook business page, or a post, for just a short time. Even though you may be following best practices and posting new material several times per day, not everyone will be checking in regularly to see it. Or, with all the clutter out there, they may not notice your ad or post the first few times it appears. It is wise to plan on running any campaign for at least one month - this will give you a longer-term view to gauge your response rate over time, and then you may adjust your message, or the scope of it, as needed.

T<strong>arget your audience</strong> - As unbelievably cool as the fantasy would be for every Facebook user to see and love your bank’s message, it’s a smarter bet that not everyone among the <a href=""http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"">1.65 billion active users</a> will care about your bank's ads. So when you’re planning your paid bank advertising, you may be able to target your ideal potential customer by selecting gender, age, geographic location and similar demographic information. This will be a better use of your budget by appealing directly to people who are more likely to want to know more info about your institution rather than “anyone out there.”

<strong>Try other networks</strong> - Other social media companies also allow you to buy general and targeted ads, especially if you think potential customers will be using their services. LinkedIn, for instance, is more of a professional network, lacking the games and general feel of Facebook. This site focuses more on workplace networking, so there are posts about economic sectors, employment trends, management strategies, hiring tips, and labor issues. Banks wanting to attract certain potential customers or employees on <a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/5-steps-to-successful-linkedin-advertising/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LinkedIn can purchase ads</a> and target everything from certain job titles to geographic areas. Though actual ad space is limited to a few dozen characters, you may include a call to action. This demographic group should be quite familiar with you, and in turn, want to know more.

<strong>Run multiple campaigns at once</strong> - Since marketing is always in motion, it’s smart to focus on one more than one prong at a time for all of your outreach. This is also of benefit for your audience – not every online user will use every network. Some may prefer Facebook, but others may frequent Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Snapchat, or any of the common platforms or search engines more regularly. Running multiple campaigns simultaneously will also provide you with a chance to customize your message for different platforms, and adjust as needed.

<strong>Easy-to-see results</strong> - A good <a href=""http://thefinancialbrand.com/33545/pay-per-click-search-engine-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">bank PPC campaign</a> has the potential to provide all sorts of data -  starting with who was reached and how they responded to your message or multiple messages. Google Ad Words or similar analytics programs share both high and low points, including the most frequently clicked keywords, where people came from, what percentage went directly to the landing page, how long they stayed, and what times of the day, week, or month saw the most activity. If you're working with someone proficient with Google AdWords, you will also have access to a general Return on Investment figure based upon how much you spent and your overall reach. Actual conversions from the campaign to customers can also be a strong indicator.

Overall, creating a bank paid search campaign can be a fun way to connect with potential new users, while also enhancing relationships with existing customers. While facilitating paid ads via your institution's social networks may be considered ""unchartered waters,"" the return is well worth the investment, with campaigns that may be customized, and that offer measurable results.

How to develop a successful bank conversion marketing program,"As featured in an earlier <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/know-your-millennial-market-property-management-marketing-for-a-new-generation/"">blog post</a>, millennials represent 92 million in the United States and are reaping the benefits of improved financial conditions after bouncing back from the recession hit. These young adults are ripe for new banking relationships and considering new bank products to suit their needs, such as checking and savings accounts. This is the perfect time to convert them into new banking customers but how does one do that with one of the most fickle generations?

Establishing a well-planned <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">conversion marketing strategy</a> is key to success realization. There are numerous formulas and methodologies from which to choose. At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we use a proprietary model called the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Conversion Matrix&#x2122; (BCM). It starts with preparing your data set, followed by activating your conversion optimization program and unlike other methodologies out there, works with both online and offline conversions.

[caption id=""attachment_10133"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""]<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BIGEYE-Conversion-Matrix.png""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10133"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BIGEYE-Conversion-Matrix-300x220.png"" alt=""BIGEYE Conversion Matrix"" width=""300"" height=""220"" /></a> BIGEYE Conversion Matrix[/caption]

Here’s how a conversion marketing program may look like for a bank:
<h3>Audience data insight<strong>
</strong></h3>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">It’s important to not only know your audience but to immerse yourself in understanding them. For example, millennials were born into technology, the Internet, read blogs, and are practically tethered to their mobile devices. It’s also important to note that these young adults are not especially brand loyal and highly influenced by their peers.</span>
<h3>Market and audience segmentation</h3>
In addition to pulling demographic, psychographic, ethnographic, and technographic insight on your audience, one must also consider the target market(s) and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">segment the audience</a> into more groups. For example, your branches may be located between a couple of neighborhoods and your audience may be a mix of individuals and companies. The approach toward attracting one segment may be significantly different than the other.
<h3>Program KPIs, goals, and objectives</h3>
One of the most important stages of establishing your BCM data set is defining your vision for success realization. What are the key performance indicators, goals, and objectives? How will you measure success? Most likely the answer will contain a number of items such as number of new accounts opened, number of bank products upsold to existing bank customers, in-branch appointments booked, number of live chat sessions, branch and ATM location look-ups, etc.
<h3>Metrics and benchmarking</h3>
Once your KPIs, goals and objectives are defined, it’s important that a form of measurement and benchmarks are set. You may feel that your conversion marketing program is successful but in order to prove your instincts in quantitative terms, you will need to run your result data through the metrics.
<h3>CRM planning</h3>
Using the right customer relationship management tool and setting it up effectively will ensure that every conversion is organized for future action to be taken. By spending some time planning your CRM strategy, your bank can build an ongoing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing program</a> and alert your customer service representatives of a customer inquiry.
<h3>SEM planning</h3>
Finally, the success of your conversions is tied in part to the quality of traffic your website and/or landing pages receive. A carefully designed <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search engine marketing program</a> that integrates organic with paid search strategies, will help drive the exact audience you are seeking to convert.
<h3>Running your conversion marketing program</h3>
<strong><a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Wells-Fargo.png""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-10136"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Wells-Fargo-300x234.png"" alt=""How To Develop a Successful Bank Conversion Marketing Program"" width=""300"" height=""234"" /></a></strong>
Once your BCM Data Set is complete, you are ready to launch your program. For new accounts, you may wish to set up dedicated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">landing pages</a> that are custom designed to provide content specific to the audience segment you wish to attract and the product or offering you wish to feature. One of your landing pages might feature your small business checking account products with clear call-to-action (CTA) messaging directing the user on how to take action. Another landing page might focus specifically on your “no fee” checking account products with a clearly stated “Apply Now” CTA button.

Once your landing pages are created and your SEM program is pointing to them, you will want to test multiple versions of each page to maximize your conversion performance potential.

Some o<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Capital-One.png""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-10135"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Capital-One-300x244.png"" alt=""How To Develop a Successful Bank Conversion Marketing Program"" width=""300"" height=""244"" /></a>f the elements you can test are as follows:

<em>Color</em> – Does the blue button perform better than the red one?

<em>Copy</em> – Are there certain words that resonate more with your audience than others?
<em>Images</em> – Is the photograph you’re using showing someone that is too old or too young? Maybe it’s not the correct ethnicity or the activity of the subject is all wrong.

<em>Content Positioning</em> – Does the user have to scroll down to far to find the CTA button or form? If so, consider trying a version of the page that brings that more prominently above the fold.

As your bank introduces new products, features, branch locations, etc., you will want to make updates to your program so that they correspond accordingly. The more targeted, relevant, and tested your program is, the more conversions you will receive.

10 things healthcare providers should know about content marketing,"If you’re in the healthcare industry, a strong <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> can help you differentiate your practice from your peers, or position your organization as a subject matter expert. Although you may be dealing with more complicated or sensitive topics, the basic principles for successful healthcare marketing campaigns aren’t much different than if you were in the marketing or financial services industry. To get you started, here are our top ten healthcare marketing ideas and why they work for healthcare professionals:
<h3><em>1. First, provide value:</em></h3>
Your patients are flocking to the internet to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">research</a> their ailments, furnish their own second opinions, and understand their bodies more than ever before. Being a source of trusted information for your patients when they are in your examining room OR surfing the internet builds deeper doctor-patient relationships, helps solidify your reputation, and can expand your practice. Providing value to your patients is as simple as posting real, actionable information and answers to common questions on your website. If you’re a nutritionist, provide starter meal plans or supplement regimes. If you’re an internist, share common tips for preventative care. If you’re a plastic surgeon, talk about the pros and cons of certain procedures. We know there’s no substitution for a face-to-face consultation, but a little foundational information goes a long way. Giving your patients access to substantive information will teach them to seek your guidance when they need to and use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">your website for self-service</a> when they don’t, creating a healthy and effective patient lifecycle.
<h3>2. Optimize for keywords:</h3>
<strong>
</strong>Make sure your potential patients can find you. The vast majority of people choose service providers based on reviews or referrals and cross check their decision against the internet to set expectations or prepare for their visit. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Optimizing your content</a> by the keywords your patients may be searching for will help your audience find you and encourage them to reach out for a consultation. If you’re new to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> or medical marketing, don’t worry. Simply write your website copy the way you would if you weren’t thinking about keyword rankings. Next, use Google Trends to find words specific enough that you aren’t competing against mega-corporations with multi-million dollar marketing budgets, but general enough that the average person would search for your practice using those terms. Last, plug them in where the content makes the most sense by replacing existing phrases. And that’s it.
<h3>3. Don’t underestimate gated content:</h3>
If you are still growing your practice, try using gated content to generate leads and invite potential patients in for a consultation. Gated content is marketing speak for downloadable information that is only accessible once you’ve entered your email address or phone number. For example, during flu season, you may offer a white paper outlining common symptoms and ways to avoid exposure in exchange for your potential patients’ contact information. Next, simply follow up by offering a consultation, flu shot, and winter survival kit. Gated content allows your potential patients to self-select into your practice and for your to reach out to a pre-qualified patient base.
<h3><a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/500x600.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-10307 alignright"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/500x600.jpg"" alt=""10 Things Healthcare Providers Should Know About Content Marketing"" width=""650"" height=""780"" /></a>4. Make it shareable:</h3>
<strong>
</strong>Some studies suggest that <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2015/nielsen-reports-that-the-average-american-adult-spends-11-hours-per-day-on-gadgets/"">the average person spends 61% of their day in front of a screen </a>– whether it’s their computer, a television, or a smartphone. People also love to share information about themselves or ideas that engage them. Making your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">website easy to read, informative, and actionable</a> will encourage patients to share your information. And don’t forget to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">maintain a presence on social media</a>. We aren’t suggesting you cultivate inappropriate personal relationships with your patients, but having an open account for your practice, or even a generic (secondary) set of profiles for yourself, can help humanize your services and make you more relatable to your patients. It’s an easy way to boost your bedside manner and make your patients feel comfortable entrusting you with their bodies.
<h3>5. Showcase your value:</h3>
Being a generalist is good, but don’t be afraid to show off your professional interests and specialties. Your unique value proposition sets you apart from the competition and lets your practice shine. Talk about your medical passions, your recent niche trainings, and any publications that have peaked your interest. Whether you choose to share this by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">posting on social media</a>, blogging, or creating a projects overview page on your website, your patients will thank you – and enjoy – understanding why you are different from the many other providers out there. As insurance becomes more widespread and medical networks fan out, your patients have more options to choose from than ever before. A strong healthcare <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> that shows off what makes you – well - you can help your practice stay on the cutting edge as the medical industry evolves.
<h3>6. Size matters:</h3>
On the flip side, you don’t want to overwhelm your web visitors with information. The sweet spot for healthcare marketing pages is between 300-500 words. After that, your audience will probably start skimming or tune out all together. Especially when translating medical information to a non-medical audience, it’s extremely important to keep your messaging short, sweet, and to the point. Keeping your pages and posts around 500 words also helps search engines crawl your pages for the most important content. Google and Bing rank search results based on relevancy and follow a strict quality over quantity policy. Ensuring that your keywords, and most relevant content fall within the first 500 words of each page will help boost your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search rankings dramatically</a>.
<h3>7. Audience engagement:</h3>
Give your audience a chance to interact with you. As a medical provider, patients feel reassured that they can reach out to you with questions. Giving them comment forums, Q&amp;A sections, or email access to your practice is a great strategy to drive engagement with your healthcare content marketing materials. It’s wonderful to provide useful information, but people also like to know that their situation is normal, or share their unique experiences.
<h3>8. Never save the best for last:</h3>
Put your best information front and center on your homepage. Although it’s tempting to build a complicated website ecosystem of links, backlinks, and sub menus that seems hyper-organized to you, this can be confusing for the average visitor because they aren’t living and breathing the information everyday the way you are. It can also hurt your search ranking. Put all the most common and relevant information on your homepage and build depth into pages that you feel may be frequented less often. If you’re unsure what content is most important, try running some <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">simple A/B tests using a tool such as Optimizely</a>. You can place certain information on the homepage and test it against other content. To determine which is resonating most with your audience, track web metrics such as time spent on site, clicks, and email submissions.
<h3>9. Pictures are still worth 1,000 words:</h3>
It almost goes without saying that few things build an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">emotional bond</a> the way pictures do. Sharing pictures of your staff, your office, or your tools, can help patients connect with your practice on a new level and envision themselves receiving care with your team. This is especially important for hospital marketing or if the work you do has any fear associated with it. Knowing that your office is a safe, peaceful environment can encourage patients to seek medical attention more frequently and feel less hesitant to reach out. Pictures act as a powerful healthcare marketing tool that builds a human and emotional bond between the services you provide and the people you serve.
<h3>10. A little blog goes a long way:</h3>
We know that healthcare professionals log long hours and dedicate a lot of emotion and time into the job. Which is why we also know that the thought of writing a weekly blog might seem tedious or like a waste of time. That said, we couldn’t emphasize the importance of blogs enough. They are one of the most powerful medical marketing tactics and help boost <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> rankings, user engagement, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a>, loyalty and leads. They are a chance for you to showcase yourself, generate shareable medical marketing content, and spread the word. Writing 300 words per week (or even every other week) is a key strategy that shouldn’t be overlooked no matter how many other items are on your to do list.

Many of the tactics we discussed are tried and true practices that most major corporations employ. For medical providers, healthcare content marketing serves the added bonus of elevating your practice – and website – to a safe place where your patients want to visit … not just need to visit.

The breakfast club remastered for a new generation,"No matter how young - or young at heart - we aim to be, it goes without saying that The Breakfast Club was one of John Hughes' prolific '80's masterpieces, replete with the perfect dose of oh, so relatable teen angst. Beloved Hughes, the late film director, producer, and screenwriter was the mastermind behind some of our favorites here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> - including National Lampoon's Vacation, Weird Science, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Uncle Buck, Home Alone...clearly, the list of American treasures is without end.

Since 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of The Breakfast Club, we decided it was only fitting that we take a cinema classic, and totally and completely remaster it - at least from a graphic design standpoint - retooling the time-honored movie poster for a new era.

We know you can't mess with perfection, but upon further analysis of each student's lunch, you have to admit that all of those high school stereotypes we recall from decades' past were perfectly exemplified. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> of creatives took the liberty of really analyzing the composition of the individual menus, including illustrations that were critically important in the development of each character. We're pretty sure we've got 'em all covered, with a few modifications to welcome a long-admired classic into the 21st century -  with a unique twist:

&nbsp;

The close of the flick is summed up quite masterfully as the five students extol a collaborative essay to Shermer High School's disciplinary principal, Mr. Vernon, with a simple quote, ""You see us as you want to see us—in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain...and an athlete...and a basket case...a princess...and a criminal. Does that answer your question?"" It's pretty plain to see why the movie is just as relatable today as it was back in 1985, and we're certain that Hughes will undoubtedly continue to make audiences laugh together for generations to come.

...and hey, we'll happily see you in the library for Saturday detention, belting ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds...with a mouthful of our Pixy Stix-Cap'n Crunch sandwich.

4 reasons why digital advertising matters in healthcare marketing,"It’s definitely a challenging time to be working in healthcare.

There are political pressures - and competing agendas - to expand or undo the insurance structure. Along with increases in billing, every insurance provider requires their own rules and paperwork, and regulations are constantly evolving regarding the best practices for discussing or sharing patient information.

On the brighter side, there are also more tools to help patients, such as information that can be easily accessed or shared on mobile devices. And the economic outlook for the industry as a whole is nothing but positive – the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the medical and health services workforce to grow by 23 percent by 2020. More Americans are now eligible for care, which is good for them, but it may create challenges for providers who already have been feeling stretched thin. Consumers are also increasingly interested in managing their own care, which also is a noble goal but can create concerns about quality.

So healthcare marketing is especially critical – providers need to get the word out that they’re available to assist. And they also need to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">connect with audiences</a> who no longer seek their services in the same places that they used to, such as newspapers or phone books.

For those who follow current healthcare marketing trends, the industry is increasingly going digital. Here are 4 reasons why you need to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">secure an online presence</a> via a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">sound digital advertising strategy</a>:

1. It’s where the audiences are:
According to the U.S. Census, 83.8 percent of households owned computers in 2013 – and jumped to 87 percent the next year. Of these, 78.5 percent own a desktop or laptop and 63 percent have a handheld computer. As of 2015, <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/06/26/americans-internet-access-2000-2015/#internet-usage-by-household-income"">84 percent of households reported regular Internet use</a>, and 73.4 reported high-speed connections. The Pew Research Center said that up to 80 percent of Americans have also tried to look up health info online, especially specific conditions or diseases for themselves or others. Whether you’re promoting your medical services on social media or online ads on other sites, your healthcare advertising can reach a significant amount of the general population. Ad programs also can let you drill down and target certain age groups or geographic areas who will especially receptive to your message.

2. Audiences want health info:
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The same Pew study showed that 70 percent of surveyed adults received healthcare information from their health provider, which is good. But 60 percent said they also get health info from friends and family, which may be riskier. With the power of the Internet, people can now learn about any sort of ailment, no matter how uncommon. It’s also an easy source to self-diagnose, from basic sniffles to a new blemish. According to the U.S. Library of Medicine’s Medline Plus site, teens are especially prone to seek out their information online first, even before talking to their parents, their teachers or health providers – 58 percent usually start with a Google search. Your healthcare digital marketing can focus on you as someone who can help find answers quickly and easily.</span></span>

3. To counter the bad stuff:
Though an online community that’s increasingly aware of basic health can have its advantages, the downside can be that they may wind up at questionable, unreliable, even dangerous sites. However, you can portray yourself as a health professional who will always provide accurate information, or dispel some of the half-truths or outright lies they may run across online. Your healthcare <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">digital advertising</a> can drive people to your site to get our perspective, and you can even reinforce the point with web content or blog posts telling why some online claims aren’t quite true.

4. To build your brand:
Whether you’re a sole provider, part of a group of physicians or even part of a hospital community, you need to claim your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">online presence</a> and find a way to stand out from the other area providers. A hospital marketing itself online can portray itself as the community’s prime source <span class=""il"">for</span> all levels of medical needs. Consider allowing visitors to do everything at the site from learning about the facility to paying a bill to finding out about area health resources and even job openings. Even though an established local health center may have good word-of-mouth by nature, a comprehensive site and an online hospital advertising campaign can increase its presence – and the perception that it is the local authority.

Though it’s easy to want to focus on performing healthcare services well, today’s consumer desires even more. At this least, prospective patients are seeking assistance to educate themselves on a specific service to determine if it might be the right avenue to pursue in treatment. It’s easy to receive unqualified advice from one’s well-meaning friends, but there’s no substitute for reliable, qualified medical opinions.

Dear Chipotle: Clickbait isn’t always a bad thing,"Let’s get controversial. You’ve probably heard the saying, “no news is good news.” You’ve probably also heard the saying, “there’s no such thing as bad publicity.” But when your company is the target of bad press – such as fast-food behemoth Chipotle’s recent scandal, thanks to the “<a href=""http://nypost.com/2015/09/04/ad-campaign-warns-that-healthy-chiptole-is-making-you-fat/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Chubby Chipotle</a>” smear campaign running in the New York Post – which maxim do you stand by?

The reality is, there’s some truth to both statements. If you suddenly find your brand at the center of unwanted attention, take a step back and remember that your response can radically influence how the public weathers the news. If we were in Chipotle’s shoes – this is what we’d do.
<h3>1. ENJOY THE CLICKBAIT:</h3>
First and foremost, publicity equals free advertising. We hate to be reductive, but in terms of raw numbers, an article in the New York Post is the public relations equivalent of a $300,000 ad campaign. Even though the article questions Chipotle’s ethics, a feature in the Post means more people will be surfing to the Chipotle site and thinking about their products. And when your burrito brand is at the top of mind, it’s also more likely to be the go-to dinner spot after a late workout at the gym. Clickbait – those scandalous headlines that blur the line between journalism and gossip while begging to be clicked - may not always yield the best online traffic, but they do increase visitors, have the possibility to go viral, and<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/""> keep people talking about your brand</a>.
<h3>2. DON’T FORGET TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE:</h3>
That said, we aren’t suggesting that you ignore the gravity of the situation. Take a step back from the immediate impact of the article and ask yourself if the situation is really going to turn customers away. If you’re a loyal Chipotle customer and you see the Chubby Chipotle ads, you may be tempted to surf onto the Chipotle website and join the conversation. If you’re anti-Chipotle, you might want to do the exact same thing. The article doesn’t reveal anything most Chipotle fans or fast-food followers don’t already know, so it may be safe to assume that this story will line tomorrow’s waste bins and little or no response is needed. If you were in Chick-Fil-A’s shoes back in 2012 when they were brought to task over their religious intolerance toward same-sex marriage, this may be a different story. Only your target audience, the severity of the article or accusations, and how brand loyal your followers are can answer that question.
<h3>3. DECIDE IF YOU NEED TO RESPOND … AND HOW:</h3>
If a response is needed, recognize the power an influx of online traffic and social media attention has on this situation and your brand. You’ve just increased your reach and given yourself an organic platform to handle the situation with grace, uniqueness, and class. A well-timed article, blog post, or Facebook <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a> could turn a scandal into a sensation and validate the values your brand stands for. No one likes to be criticized, but a memorable response can make or break the public’s reaction to even the worst faux pas. For example, on August 6, Vanity Fair ran an article chastising Tinder for supporting an unhealthy “hook-up culture.” Thirty-one rapid-fire Tweets later from one of Tinder’s employees, and the abashed dating site went from zero to hero. The company never admitted whether the response was planned or not, but the results prove our point entirely.

We feel for you, Chipotle. But when life gives you lemons  … we recommend that you make a big ol' burrito with all the fixin's.

Why video production matters more than ever for your business,"Just because cable and network broadcasting subscriptions are dropping, doesn’t mean people aren’t watching videos and rich media. In 2016, Google announced that <a href=""http://www.reelseo.com/hours-minute-uploaded-youtube/"">more then 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube per minute</a>. That’s right, we said per minute. Last year, that number was only 300 hours per minute. In other words, that’s a 200% annual increase in video production. In addition to user-based video hubs such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/"">YouTube</a> or <a href=""https://vine.co/"">Vine</a>, streaming video sites such as <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/"">Netflix</a>, <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/"">Hulu</a> and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2676882011&amp;nodeParams=%7B%26%2334%3BredirectWeblab%26%2334%3B%20%3A%20%26%2334%3BAIV_STOREFRONT_32560%26%2334%3B%7D"">PrimeVideo</a> are all on the rise. There is no sign that video production is decreasing – it’s just being consumed in a different way, which is why videos for businesses are becoming such an integral part of the marketing mix. If you’re still on the fence about the value of a strong video marketing campaign, here's our two cents on the matter:
<h3>Videos drive engagement:</h3>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Studies show that you have less than 3 seconds to grab your consumer's attention. So yes, first impressions seriously matter. Three seconds isn’t enough time to read detailed copy about your customer service and product features, but it is ample enough to allow viewers to become drawn into a powerful video showcasing your brand values in a way that makes your audience want to learn more. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">Good video production</a> will engage your audience and hold their attention longer than text or static images ever could. In a recent study by Implix, companies found that people were 96% more likely to click on an email if there was an introductory video embedded in the content. If the very act of showcasing a video can drive double-digit engagement, imagine what watching compelling videos for businesses has the power to do.</span>
<h3>Conversion, conversion, conversion:</h3>
We’re not shy. We know your main goal is to drive business and conversion, which is why we love videos. According to Forbes, more than 90% of retail consumers cite video as a key part of their purchase process and that they are <a href=""https://blog.kissmetrics.com/product-videos-conversion/"">64% to 85% more likely to buy a product after watching an informational video</a>. E-commerce sites such as <a href=""http://www.zappos.com/"">Zappos</a> and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/gw/ajax/s.html/176-3631218-7286221"">Amazon</a> rely on videos to showcase their products in a real-world setting, while hotels and tourism sites use video to show off their venues and unique experiences, and business service organizations employ video production to explain complicated products or add service value. No matter what industry you’re in, video can capture your value proposition and translate it in a way that drives consumer engagement by building trust and clarity.
<h3>Videos help people do business with brands they like:</h3>
It’s no secret that the general public trusts social media, user reviews, and viral content more than carefully curated ad <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaigns</a> and polished publicity stunts. While this isn’t surprising, the shift has thrown marketers into a tailspin over the past decade. Are marketers becoming obsolete in a world where consumers have the power to oust bad brand behavior and share their real-life experiences with your products? No. But we do need to start communicating with our audience from a place of authenticity and transparency. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">Corporate video production</a> is your chance to show your brand’s personality from a genuine perspective that allows your audience to choose if your value proposition resonates with their needs. Whether you're working with user-generated videos or a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">professional video production company</a> to craft your media, there is something deeply humanizing about watching other people just like us on film. And at the end of the day, most people want to do business with people and brands that they truly like.
<h3>It's okay to be trendy:</h3>
Whether you’re a YouTube or Netflix junkie - or neither, the internet has exploded with video content. And each episode of your favorite sitcom and trendy YouTube tutorial usually comes loaded with a video ad. ComScore estimates that more than 45.4% of internet users view at least one video per month. If your audience isn’t watching your viral video that just hit 1.5M views, they could at least be watching the video ad you ran before their next funny dog clip. People are self-selecting video content as a primary way to learn about brands and communicate with each other. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">Corporate video production</a> gives you the unique opportunity to take advantage of this trend and get in on the action while it’s still a relatively new and emerging media.

The trick to successfully <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">driving video marketing campaigns</a> is to target the right audience at the right place and at the right time. A strong video production company or social marketing agency can help you define your strategy and begin building your voice or help you find tools to serve and measure your audience’s needs. From there, it’s a simple matter of being you and letting your brand shine. Video production can be as simple or as complicated as your budget or taste allows, and it can be as inexpensive or cost-intensive as you’d like. It’s one of the most flexible marketing tools we have at our disposal as well as one of the most efficient. In all honesty, we can’t think of a reason why producing videos for a brand don’t just plain make good business sense.

Here are the best seven portfolio tips from a recent graduate,"Well, this is it – the biggest, most pivotal project of your life, right? Not exactly.

A portfolio is essential to the career of any graphic designer regardless of their skill set in various disciplines. The best way to think of this designer cornerstone is as a resume, skill sheet, and work example all rolled into one. It’s the most direct way for a potential employer, creative or not, to identity if you have the capabilities necessary to fulfill the job title. While a portfolio isn’t the end all be all, it can be the difference between landing a job - or designing more cat posters for your aunt’s tearoom.

By using these 7 tips,  you can set yourself on a path to design the portfolio of your- and your future employer's - dreams:
<h3>TIP 1: PLANNING</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">Organizing</a> your workflow, priorities, and process when creating your portfolio is essential to the overall success of your work. The order, style, elements, and media are all important to consider before starting the design process.
<h3>TIP 2: DIVERSIFY</h3>
Having a wide spread of projects, with varying applications and components, will help show your potential employer that you have a diverse set of skills that could be used in a large variety of projects. In addition to planning out your portfolio projects, you should also try to share your work using other channels, such as: <a href=""https://dribbble.com/"">Dribbble</a>, <a href=""https://www.behance.net/"">Behance</a>, <a href=""http://www.aiga.org/"">AIGA</a>, LinkedIn, or even a personal website. Diversifying where your work can be seen can be a great way to get noticed and hired!
<h3>TIP 3: DESIGN DON'T DOCUMENT</h3>
If you are creating a portfolio of past work, there needs to be a good balance of what you show: process, parts, and end product. However, it is important that you design your projects to impress your reader - not just let them know that you're capable of making a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">brochure</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a>. Design a project to make your reader excited and astounded, not just to check off a box in their head. Milton Glaser puts it best, “There are three responses to a piece of design: yes, no, and wow. Wow is the one to aim for.”
<h3>TIP 4: PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
As crazy as it sounds, photography is possibly one of the most important components of a successful portfolio because it is so superficial. Whether you are using PSD mockups or taking photos of your work, they need to look flawless and professional – the reason being that most people won’t read your portfolio, they will look at the pictures and draw their own conclusions. As designers, we put so much thought into our work; so at the very least, we need to visually show our commitment to the reader through the use of quality photography. Check out Creative Market for some great mockups.
<h3>TIP 5: LESS IS MORE</h3>
I’m a firm believer in less is more design and I think it is one of the most important parts of a portfolio, in digital or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print</a>. You should craft your portfolio to account for people’s low attention spans; ideally, they shouldn’t need to read a paragraph to understand what your project was about.
<h3>TIP 6: DESIGN FOR THE USER</h3>
Design your portfolio for the job you are interested in. If you want to be a web designer and are going in for an interview, you probably don’t need to show 5 projects of packaging you’ve made. A helpful tip is to set your print portfolio up without page numbers and with adhesive hingestips – this will allow you to reorganize your portfolio into the best order for the job you are applying for, perhaps web projects first, then advertising projects, then print. Another tip may be to bring your portfolio on an ipad as a PDF or upload it to <a href=""http://www.issuu.com"">ISSUU.com</a> or even bring in some mockups of projects you’ve made.
<h3>TIP 7: STAND OUT!</h3>
I can’t say this enough: stand out from the crowd. Obviously you are different from other designers, you have your own style, skills, and strengths but you really need to show it in your portfolio. Wild, unique projects, innovative packaging, or something just plain funny can really separate you from the crowd and land you in the job you’re looking for.

I hope these tips will help direct you in making a great portfolio and eventually help you into that dream job!

The art of integrating customer service into social media management,"Social media is a powerful, organic force that can make or break a brand -  or even set the tone and personality of an organization. One of the most overlooked facets of social media management is its power to enhance your customer service strategy. According to Nielsen’s Social Media report, <a href=""http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service"">67% of your audience uses social media</a> to seek advice, share a review, or make some noise (aka complain). Did we mention that <a href=""http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/24-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service"">33% of social media users also prefer this type of customer care</a> to complex phone prompts or sitting on hold for 45 minutes? Yeah, we weren’t surprised either.

If you aren’t already using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media monitoring</a> to integrate customer service into your social media strategy, we’ve put together our top eight reasons to jumpstart your social care team.
<h3>1. Social care drives social media strategy:</h3>
If the heart of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a> is about creating authentic brand experiences, then it should be easy to understand how a personalized social media experience might satisfy your customers’ need to feel heard. Social media is a proverbial platform or soapbox for your customers to cheer for, or on the flip side - to chastise your brand. When you use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media to monitor</a> your clients’ satisfaction and respond to issues openly in an arena where they arguably have more control than you do, you are setting your brand up for resolution more quickly because the audience knows they are being taken seriously.
<h3>2. Multi-channel care supports flawless social media management:</h3>
You know the value of multi-channel sales: some people like to talk on the phone, some people prefer to read information online and digest it before making a decision, and others flock to social media to choose the solution their peers recommend. The same applies to customer service. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">Multi-channel</a> care allows your customers to seek the type of help they need. If they feel best calling in – let them. But if they prefer to interact with you on the fly as they are checking-in at their favorite lunch spot – why inhibit the conversation from evolving naturally? Letting your customers communicate with you how and where they want to do so is a small gesture that reminds them that you care about their needs.
<h3>3. Anticipate your customers' needs with social media monitoring:</h3>
Good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media monitoring</a> allows you to understand and anticipate your customers’ needs. By listening to what your customers are saying on social media and adapting your self-service portals accordingly, or addressing hints of poor service experiences before they blossom into full-scale issues, you can cut back on the volume of care required of your customers. This can save you costs on call centers or service fees and – more importantly – create and maintain a satisfied customer base. After all, keeping a customer is a lot easier than finding a new one.
<h3>4. Set your own benchmarks. Against yourself:</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">Social media monitoring</a> also helps to ensure that you remain honest with yourself. With such a wide variety of monitoring tools from word cloud generators to social media attitude aggregators, it takes very little effort to gauge and track sentiment toward your brand. If one of your goals is improving customer satisfaction, use social media to get a quick pulse on how you’re measuring up to your expectations. It’s easy to blame slow customer service evolution on complicated or expensive measuring tools and unreliable or qualitative feedback. Social media monitors make it quick, simple, and (hopefully) painless. In other words, no more excuses.
<h3>5. Time is money:</h3>
Most consumers expect a one day turn around when <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">sending emails to a customer service account</a>. And in a world filled with endlessly high call volumes, they also expect service calls to take anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour. It’s safe to assume that when a customer is reaching out about an issue, waiting does not positively impact the situation. Good social media management that supports your care team can alleviate this pain point in two ways. First, it frees up your customers to multi-task in a pleasant online environment while they wait for a response. Second, it frees up your team to respond to and resolve multiple issues at once on an as-needed basis. We like to think of it as instant gratification at its finest, and on all fronts.
<h3>6. Create brand advocates through social media management:</h3>
Turn an issue into advocacy. If your social team responds to customers who are self-selecting social users in a speedy and thoughtful fashion, those same public complainers may quickly turn into public brand cheerleaders, touting your individualized service experience, responsiveness, and transparency when dealing with issues. That makes you look like a rock star and allows prospects to see how much you value your customers. This same audience of consumers understands that brands make mistakes. After all, they’re (run by) people, too. How a brand handles those issues is the real question. From that perspective, your customer support must to be included in your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a>.
<h3>7. Control the conversation by setting the tone:</h3>
In the customer service world, it isn’t always what you say – it’s how you say it. Social care gives you the opportunity to respond in a tone that matches your brand, eliminating costly and time-consuming coaching, training, or any errors associated with maintaining call centers. If your brand tone is casual and cool, your social media responses can instill that same sense of calm in unhappy reviewers. If your brand tone is formal, a white-glove approach via customized social posts during and after an issue might be just what your clients need to restore their faith in your organization.
<h3>8. Because there's no reason not to:</h3>
And last – but not least – why not? Whether you use an agency to take care of your social media management or DIY tools such as <a href=""http://signup.hootsuite.com/pro-ent-na-english-r8/?&amp;mkwid=sDAsRitua_dc&amp;pcrid=44690206414&amp;pkw=hootsuite&amp;pmt=e&amp;cntry=na-usa&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=hootsuite_pro_google_search_usa_english_branded_alpha&amp;gclid=CO66gJ7x7McCFUKRHwodIiEG6A"">Hootsuite</a>, responding to customer service issues and formulating a seamless follow-up plan around your customers’ needs has never been easier, more efficient, or less expensive.

It’s easy to think of social media as a place for top-of-funnel brand explorers to find information or happy customers to engage with your brand. But that would be missing the other 33% who just need a little social love, which is why we believe <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media monitoring</a> is a key component when providing flawless customer service and care.

10 tips to develop a social media marketing plan for you business,"There are probably worse situations to be in than drawing a blank on what to post on social media.

When it's part of your daily duties, and you see your scheduled “must post” time quickly approaching, with nothing to say, well, it’s easy to wish you were anywhere but in that predicament.

The good news is that you're not the first person to face a similar situation, and the way things are going with so many new <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media channels</a> and processes to available to get the word out, you won’t be the last.

However, you and your marketing team can easily avoid much of the whole “oh no -- what in the world am I going to say now?” dilemma by working to develop a solid <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketing plan</a>, which should cover all aspects of your message: when to say it, who will say it, how to say it, and how often to say it. Of course, the “what” is up to you, your company, and your team’s overall <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a>.

Creating and sticking to a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketing plan</a> can be a challenge to an organization that has long-since relied on a “try to find something to say but don’t sweat it” philosophy, or worse yet, no philosophy at all. But this kind of plan can help everyone to know what’s coming, and hopefully provide an opportunity to craft better messages and target audiences more precisely. It beats doing it on the fly.

For those wondering how to get started, try these 10 tips to develop a solid Social Media Marketing Plan:
<h3>1. Determine the project's goal.</h3>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">What’s the company’s purpose for investing time and possibly other resources into social media? Do you want more customers? Do you want to improve outreach? Be seen as more personable? Improve visibility of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">company website</a>? Seen as experts in your industry?</span>
<h3>2. Figure out who will be involved.</h3>
A mistake that some businesses make is creating social media pages because they’re told they should, and either not appointing anyone to “feed” them regularly or telling the already busy staff “do it when you have a chance or are caught up on everything else.” Which can be perceived internally and externally as “we don’t care enough to take care of this well.” If you haven’t learned about social media yet, one of the rules of the road is that fresh content looks great, and less fresh content looks terrible. So at least one person should be assigned social media marketing duties as a prime function, and preferably a few others to help out from within the company. If people are busy, everyone could be assigned one rotating “create + publish day” or a different channel to manage.
<h3>3. Figure out your ideal social media audience.</h3>
Hopefully, you already have an idea of where your customers are coming from and their demographic make-up, either through feedback from actual customers or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">digital analytics</a>. Or there could already be a positive social media presence that you could build upon, such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">videos shot</a> with your product or on your property already online. Knowing basic demographic information like gender and age can help you decide where to target <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">your social media presence</a>. For instance, <em><a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/new-social-stratosphere-who-using-facebook-twitter-pinterest-tumblr-and-instagram-2015-and-beyond-1622"">AdWeek</a></em> said that the average age of Facebook users keeps increasing, and is now in its early 30s. If you know more, like hobbies and interests, you can target some of the smaller channels geared to your industry or your customer base.
<h3>4. Learn your budget.</h3>
Participation in a social network – usually free -- makes them appealing for budget-conscious businesses. But most modern networks don’t necessarily make it easy for you to reach all your users without paying extra.  Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and recently Instagram all offer methods to expand your reach for extra money. On Facebook, the cost varies based on the amount of people you want to see your page/post, and how many people already like it. Cost ranges from a few dollars a day to more than $100.  But it can be worth it to an organization eager to get the word out -- Facebook claims that any given business post will only show up in about 10 percent of the news feeds of people who already like them or don’t visit their page regularly.
<h3>5. Figure out primary and secondary sites to target.</h3>
Start with general sites like Facebook or Twitter, since that’s where big audiences are, but also consider diversifying.  Facebook is a given simply because of its global reach. <a href=""http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"">As of spring 2015</a>, there were 1.49 billion active users worldwide – more than the population of China! Facebook’s strength is also being able to provide analytic information for business accounts, including details of your followers. However, just because someone follows your FB page doesn’t mean they’ll convert into customers. A recent <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-alter-social-media-strategies-1403499658""><em>Wall Street Journal</em> piece</a> discussed how the Ritz-Carlton had pulled back on its Facebook presence – it was getting a lot of followers, but not leading to increases in room bookings. Like the hotel chain did, consider something else that may provide you with a more specialized audience for your content.
<h3>6. Determine a publishing schedule.</h3>
A calendar/schedule can cover everything from how many times a day to push something out (short answer: it depends on the channel/message) to a weekly schedule of different channels. While Twitter may encourage rapid activity through the day, some sites like LinkedIn may need less regular updates and more attention/interaction. This could so be a place to plan how to execute any goals.  Are you interested in boosting likes this month? Click-thrus? Engagement? Shares? New channel? Are there any special events or promotions coming up that will require extra help or a different schedule?
<h3>7. Figure out what you can do in-house.</h3>
Maybe your employers want everything to be generated by the staff, including the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy</a> and the day-to-day content creation. Or maybe if marketing employees are needed for other projects, some or all of the duties can be outsourced to a social media marketing agency. Or maybe there can be a combination of guidance from the marketing team on what topics to cover, and the agency can assist putting the word out to appropriate sites using current best practices.
<h3>8. Plan for plan B's.</h3>
You could create the most intricate plan that looks great. But sooner or later your social media marketing effort will come into contact with reality, so will need to be adjusted. It potentially should be easy to substitute posting days if someone on the team  is ill or needed for another priority that day. Or maybe company officials will decide to try that “pay to boost’ plan you’ve been talking about, so the strategy on that particular network may need to be modified. Part of the plan’s strength is how adaptable everyone can be, rather than declaring “doesn’t work’ the minute something goes south. Some channels also allow you to schedule posts, so you can write your Saturday and Sunday Tweets on a Friday and enjoy your weekend.
<h3>9. Decide how to unify all social media with its greater online presence.</h3>
Though social media can demand all you and your team’s time and attention, the company’s ultimate goal is to make money, so your Social Media Marketing Plan is only one component of it. When planning what channels to focus on, make sure the profile and any links on posts point back to the main site. Likewise, the site should include links to the different channels.
<h3>10. Keep track of past performances.</h3>
Social networking behavior can be strange and unpredictable, so essentially we’re always just making educated guesses about what people like, why they like it, and how long they’ll keep liking it. And even though your organization should always be looking forward, it’s also important to see the good and the bad. What metrics have changed and why? Did anything change with different publishing times than usual as far as engagement, interest or conversions? Like the stock market, past Internet trends may not always apply to our current situations, but they can be good starting places.

Overall, the key to a good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Social Media Marketing Plan</a> is to be organized with a schedule but also be adaptable if something needs to change. This can include being flexible on changing scheduled posts, doing a fewer or more on certain days, and trying out new channels if it could draw in new customers.

How to get your business on the first page of Google through SEO,"With the data suggesting that there are <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/google-now-handles-2-999-trillion-searches-per-year-250247"">more than 6 billion Google searches each day</a> and that <a href=""http://www.infront.com/blogs/the-infront-blog/2015/6/17/value-of-first-page-google-results"">91.5% of the total clicks go to websites listed on the first page of Google</a>, it’s no surprise that the first page is a popular place to be. But how can you make sure your business appears there?

There are actually many ways to appear on the first page of Google – from paid listings through <a href=""https://www.google.com/adwords/"">AdWords</a>, to local listings on <a href=""https://www.google.com/business/"">Google My Business</a>, to news listings for certain queries. But when you are looking to appear on the first page, the primary place to start is with the organic listings. These listings appear on every single Google search results page, and show 7 to 10 webpages that are both relevant to the search query and well-structured for search engine optimization, or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>. Since these listings make up the majority of first page results, we’ll focus on the process behind trying to get your webpages ranked in this very important space.

As with most things in life, good search engine optimization (SEO) and ranking on the first page of Google starts with research. Keyword research can be used to determine categorically those services and goods that your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> is using the internet to search for or conduct research on. (And the data suggests that it’s over 80% of their major purchases)! More specifically, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">keyword research</a> allows you to determine what keywords your audience is using when they search for specific products. You could have the best SEO in the world, and yet if you haven’t done the research to know that your consumers are searching for - such “gizmos” and not “gadgets"", Google won’t see your page as relevant enough to rank on the first page for all the users who are searching for “gizmos”.

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/#seo-and-the-first-page-of-google"">[blogCTA] Request a free SEO report [/blogCTA]</a>
<h3>Keyword research: The beginning of the SEO process</h3>
Keyword research is the process of using Google’s search tools to build out a list of commonly searched keywords with statistics such as their average monthly searches, competition rating, and average <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">cost per click</a> price from AdWords. It’s best to utilize keyword research to find low-hanging fruit: keywords that have high monthly searches and a low competition rating. And if those keywords also happen to have a high average cost per click, well, that's even better – if people who are purchasing keywords for paid search commonly view that keyword as being valuable enough to spend a lot of money to purchase, then it’s probably a strong keyword!

After you’ve completed your research and identified which keywords are likely to be the best drivers of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">qualified traffic to your website</a>, you’ll want to choose one keyword to represent the content of each page you are expecting to receive organic search traffic from. If you are designing your website as you begin this process, remember that each of these pages will be an entry page for new users who may not have heard of your brand before, or may be unfamiliar with your services.

You’ll want to choose a single keyword for each page, so that you can be sure that you are structuring the content on the page to specifically provide the information that users are looking for when they are searching. Remember that people search online to answer a specific need, and if you are not answering that need, they will look elsewhere. Webpages that have strong content that is built to answer a well-researched, common search query are the ones that do best in Google. This is as a result of Google’s SEO ranking algorithm, designed to find content that will answer Google searchers' needs. The last thing Google wants is for users to click on multiple webpages listed on the first page of Google and not find the information they were searching for. If Google search results couldn’t consistently provide people with the information they are seeking, we would quickly learn to go elsewhere and Google’s central business model would be in serious trouble.
<h3><strong>
</strong>Technical SEO</h3>
After you’ve crafted your content to reflect exactly what users are searching for - utilizing the specific keyword you’ve researched -  there’s still some minor search engine optimization work to be done. What is left to be completed are the on-page factors that let Google know you have taken their algorithm’s needs and limitations into consideration, and optimized your webpage accordingly. This is oftentimes referred to as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">technical SEO</a>, as it pertains to the HTML attributes of a page – the H1 heading, title tag, meta description, and any image or video ALT tags.

The H1 heading is general used by a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content management system</a> or CMS as the headline of any page, and Google views this as a succinct description of what a page contains. Depending on how much content you have on your page, you may also have H2 headings and H3 headings, which function as sub-headlines to break-up content. Since the H1 heading is a description of what your page content is about, Google looks to make sure that it is relevant to a given search query. You should also be sure to utilize the keyword you have chosen for your page in the H1 heading, and likely in the H2 and H3 headings, as well, if applicable.

The title tag (sometimes called the SEO title) and the meta description are the two aspects of your page that Google uses to showcase your webpage in the search results. The title tag will be shown underlined in large, blue font on the search results page, with the meta description included in a smaller grey font beneath it, and the URL. Not only does Google use these attributes to show your webpage to searchers, it also emboldens any words in your title tag and meta description that match a given search query. That means that including your chosen keyword in these attributes will increase the likelihood searchers will click your result because their attention will be drawn to the bolded words.

Image and video ALT tags are extremely important, because while Google is an expert at understanding written content, it is unable to fully understand images or videos in the same semantic way humans are able to do so. As such, it’s extremely important for SEO to include an ALT tag for every video and image on your page, describing what is happening in the picture or video. Since all of your content should relate back to your chosen keyword, it’s likely that this description will include your keyword, as well.

Once you’ve completed all of the technical on-page elements of SEO, it’s time to publish your content to the web! Be sure that once you’ve published your content successfully, you link to it from your website’s homepage, and use <a href=""https://www.google.com/webmasters/"">Google Webmaster Tools</a> to let Google know that you have added content to your site. If you are publishing an entire website, you’ll want to use Google Webmaster Tools to request that Google crawl your site, and update an XML sitemap to make it easy for Google to understand your site's architecture.

Don’t worry about building links to your content for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> – if you’ve put in the work at the beginning, and researched what users are searching for, carefully crafting content that answers their needs, it will attract links naturally. But it’s a great idea to make sure that as many people are aware you’ve created great content as possible, so make sure that you share it with your social networks - and any other offline connections you have that would be interested.

"The history of the hashtag, pound sign, and octothorpe","#hashtaghistory #itisntwhatyouthink #italmostwasntatall #<wbr />itcouldhavebeenoctothorpeorwor<wbr />se.

If you can make sense of those words and can sling tags #likeaboss, give yourself a #goldstar.

But if all you see is a jumble of letters and words, here’s a quick overview.

Putting the ‘pound’ sign – or by its more recognizable term ‘hashtag’ -- in front of a word or a group of words creates a discussion <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">topic in social media</a>, which is why you see them in Tweets, Facebook posts, Pinterest pins, texts, online news stories, and even creeping into personal correspondence.

Putting a “49erfan” hashtag on a Facebook, Instagram or Twitter post about a favorite football team, for instance, can invite fellow fans to take part in a conversation, or add their own input by including the tag in their posts. Tags can also be now used in web searches, or as a PS/final thought to summarize and personalize a post. You may not necessarily want to continue a conversation like #thatsallfolks but it is a fun way to sign off, along the lines of #micdrop or #peaceouthomies.

But as interesting as it can be to use them, the history of the hashtag is even more so.
<h3>The history of the hashtag</h3>
Common knowledge tells us that Twitter was responsible for unleashing hashtags on the world. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media channel</a> certainly helped their popularity and use, but the history of the hashtag goes back to the early 1960s when engineers at Bell Labs were trying to replace the rotary phone.

In 1963, a Bell Telephone touch-tone research team came up with the idea of a grid of 12 buttons, with 0 and two other spaces at the bottom. One spot was designated an asterisk/star and the other a cross-hatch/diamond, both symbols already on keyboards and ASCII text. Programmers also used the hashtag symbol to break up strings of numbers.

According to a recent <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/10/the-secret-history-of-the-hashtag-slash-and-interrobang/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wired piece</a> about the “secret origins” of the hashtag, the slash and the interrobang, a Bell Labs employee called the “pound” sign an octothorpe – it had eight legs and it so happened he was a fan of baseball player Jim Thorpe.

A <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/before-the-hashtag-there-was-the-octothorpe-1672570850"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Gizmodo article</a> on the early history of the hashtag said it was an improvement from a nonsense name generated by Bell marketing employee Lauren Asplund – “octoherp,” since he didn’t think Americans would want to say or remember “pound sign.”

The concept of using a character to designate separate discussion channels was used by IRC in the late 1980s, an early form of chat/instant messaging. But in 2007, the idea was suggested to Twitter, which seemed to make sense for a text-based service where the goal is to be brief.

Online designer Chris Messina is credited with suggesting that the company’s leadership invite and encourage users to use the # sign as an easy way to create or participate in “group” areas or topics (his first use of hashtag was “#barcamp”). He believed they could bring like-minded people together, show what topics are currently being talked about, can be searched, and measured/analyzed to see how well a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">digital campaign</a> is performing.

Messina said that his idea was rejected as being too technical. He also was given a prediction that the idea would never catch on.

However, he encouraged the Twitter community to try them, including developer Nate Ritter, who used “#sandiegofire” to let California residents on Twitter follow coverage/related Tweets about the 2007 fires in San Diego.

Facebook began incorporating them in 2013, and today, hashtags remain a popular tool for consumers and marketers.

3 ways you need to boost your Twitter engagement now,"""Help me increase my Twitter engagement” is a cry for help that can excite many amateur <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media consultants</a>. In the wrong hands, this intention can lead to sketchy and expensive solutions, including creating bogus accounts and paying a ton of money to artificially and inconsistently boost your presence.

The truth is, the power to increase your Twitter engagement rate has been in your hands all along. There are several simple yet effective methods to organically gain more followers, more Retweets and more click-throughs to your site, and they don’t have to cost you any more than some extra time or some of your staff’s time.

You might not hit the million follower mark in a month, or be in Lady Gaga/Pope Francis superstar range right away, but you can still see steady and honest growth from lolyal fans who like what you have to say.

Try these modern methods to learn how to increase Twitter engagement:
<h3>Content</h3>
When you post or how you post are important. But what’s most vital is what you post. The best way to get followers and increase your twitter engagement is to offer frequent and interesting Tweets that people can comment on, Retweet, or ‘favorite.’

Twitter itself encourages this focus in its <a href=""https://business.twitter.com/solutions/tweet-engagements"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Business/Solutions section</a> with step-by-step suggestions to leverage your Tweets. The seven-stage method includes picking your tools, designing your content, defining your audience and budget, and keeping track of what works and what doesn’t.

<a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/2014/what-fuels-a-tweets-engagement"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">A related Twitter blog post</a> shared that, after studying common factors of 2 million Tweets created over a month, common elements in successful Twitter engagement campaigns include tweets that contain photos, hashtags, links, and videos. Tweets that contain at least one digit also seem to perform better than ones without a number.
<h3>Make it a conversation</h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">Social media</a> has enough people expressing opinions regularly, and with Twitter, it’s especially easy to simply churn out random thoughts, or worse, information about your business. The random thoughts aren’t a bad idea, as long as they’re interesting. If an employee is especially witty in under 140 characters, give them this task. Frequent business plugs are also discouraged –Twitter has been compared to a cocktail party, where it’s OK to occasionally mention who you are and what you do, but not talk about yourself all the time.

Instead, you need to engage others so they’ll return the favor. Answer people’s questions in public. Join a discussion under a certain hashtag. Go to a Tweetup in your community (or start one). Once people start knowing that you have interesting things to say – and interesting Tweets they can Retweet, (especially if they don’t have to come up with them themselves), the loyalty will grow. Klout, a social media influence site, suggests “paying it forward” by giving public credit to sources if you discuss a topic.
<h3>Make it easy</h3>
By creating interesting content and sharing it, you’re doing a favor to people who can’t think of anything to say – they can simply retweet yours and hopefully give you credit. But Entrepreneur says you can <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242123"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">do a lot more</a> to encourage your audience, and thereby <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">increase your twitter engagement</a>. This can include making shorter Tweets -- if you use all 140 characters, it’s hard for someone to add their own thoughts when they ReTweet yours. It can also include using services like <a href=""http://bit.ly/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">bit.ly</a> or tinyurl to shorten links – there’s no need to take up character space with a lengthy url. You also can simply occasionally ask for a Retweet once in awhile and hope people oblige. Another way to make sure your content catches people’s eyes, besides making a lot of it, is to repost the same post a couple of times a day. Someone may miss your morning Tweet but appreciate that it comes back around in the afternoon. Or, repeat a late-night post occasionally for night owls/early birds/international followers.

The social media landscape is continuously evolving, and a Twitter engagement method that may have worked three years ago may not be as effective. Likewise, there are some great tools available to assist you. Ready to learn more?

Market the rainbow: The science of colors in branding,"The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">science of colors in branding</a> has long been up for debate. Many academics insist color affinity is born from personal experience, background, and individual preference rather than proven branding or marketing psychology. Yet, according to <a href=""http://www.colorcom.com/research/why-color-matters"">ColorCom</a>, up to 92.6% of peoples’ perception about a brand relates to their feelings about that logo’s colors. And 80% of brand recognition relies on color association according to the blog <a href=""http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/color-and-branding"">Color Matters</a>. Although the reason “why,” may be unclear, it <em>is</em> clear that brand color schemes can profoundly influence your target audience’s ability to remember and relate to your product. Our breakdown of the rainbow reveals what your brand color schemes say about you and your organization.
<h3>Red</h3>
Netflix. Target. CNN. EXXON. Coca-Cola. Time. These brands’ logos are dominated by a bold, bright red. At the very top of the rainbow and one of three primary colors, red channels a vivacious energy, and frank, action-oriented vibe. Many branding psychologists believe the color red inspires action by creating a sense of urgency and importance. For lifestyle brands such as Target or Coca-Cola, red translates to a desire to consume, while media channels such as Time, Netflix or CNN, benefit from the color’s bias toward action.
<h3>Orange</h3>
Orange is one of the less popular colors in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">branding and brand design</a>. The color is more frequently used as a highlight rather than a dominant marketing campaign color. We most often see orange on “try,” or “buy,” buttons, and other calls to action thanks to the color’s warm, inviting tone (just begging to be clicked). However, many psychologists believe orange carries some of the anxiety-laden undertones found in yellow, and may serve as a better caution or warning sign than as a conversion catalyst. Organizations associated with a degree of ruggedness, such as Harley Davidson or Home Depot, benefit most from this duel psychological profile. However, more cheerful brands, such as Blogger and Nickelodeon, can also leverage the sunny hue’s tendency to inspire happiness and warmth.
<h3>Yellow</h3>
Because yellow is one of the easiest colors for the eye to distinguish (which is why many fire trucks and ambulances are yellow), brands use this color to grab consumers’ attention. The color itself has duel associations: some schools of thought align yellow with feelings of warmth and happiness, while other brand design experts associate yellow with anxiety and stress, due to the strain it puts on the eye. A wide variety of brands – from Hertz and Yellow Pages to Best Buy and IKEA – rely on the color’s bright “look at me” vibe to drive an unforgettable, top-of-mind reference in their respective industries.
<h3>Green</h3>
Depending on the tone, green works as a jack-of-all-trades. It’s one of the few colors in branding that carries a wide variety of connotations. Emotions associated with green range from jealousy, money and lust, to zen, environmental consciousness, and good health. The psychology behind green-dominated brand design leverages the color’s versatility. As a non-primary color, green can skew more yellow, more blue, or even more red (in an earthy translation of this refreshing, leafy color). The result gives green more flexibility and personal association potential than many other colors, so it’s no surprise that a variety of brands from contradicting industries have latched onto this color. Think: Starbucks, GREEN Certification, Whole Foods, BP Mobile, XBOX, and Holiday Inn.
<h3>Blue</h3>
Blue is the most popular color among both men and women, making it a popular, tried and tested choice within brand color schemes (hello Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Skype, Ford, Dell, Walmart, and GE). Blue’s cool undertones are often associated with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">peace, stability, and serenity</a>, which reduces some of the hard sales associations that colors such as yellow or red may inspire. Because blue’s sense of peace and stability easily translate to security, many corporate and financial institutions rely on the earnest attitude conveyed through a blue logo.
<h3>Violet</h3>
Purple’s swirling blend of red and blue stimulate feelings of royalty, mysticism, and elegance. Although many brands shy away from this color because of the heavy female to male bias, purple bridges the gap between “quirky” and “regal” with ease. As a result, it’s often used on female-centric branding campaigns (such as Revlon and Hallmark) or whimsical, child-friendly brands (such as Willy Wonka Chocolate or the Big Brothers Big Sisters Organization). The color's difficulty to classify makes it a popular choice among brands intentionally shying away from the mainstream bias, such as the LGBT community, and many yoga companies or holistic wellness centers.
<h3>Psychology of colors in branding</h3>
Whether your customers respond to the marketing psychology behind colors in branding, or they simply react to the socially constructed responses that growing-up in the U.S. has conditioned them to feel, doesn’t matter. As Greg Ciotti, from <a href=""http://www.helpscout.net/blog/psychology-of-color/"">Help Scout</a>, explains: “it’s far more important for your brand’s colors to support the <em>personality</em> you want to portray instead of trying to align with stereotypical color associations.” The proof is there. People respond to colors. It’s your job to choose a color that resonates with your brand, as well as the message you hope to convey. Whether you call it psychological brand design or simply good taste, colors can have a profound impact on your bottom line - and your brand's recognition in the consumer marketplace.

"Retargeting (or remarketing) is creepy, but it sure works","<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">Retargeting</a> has been described as “turning window shoppers into buyers,” something that every business craves.

But this actually isn’t the best analogy – perhaps more of an overeager sales clerk who helps you in the store, then accompanies you to several other stores, all the while telling you what you’re missing out on.

You may call it a little creepy. The sales associate may call it being pleasantly persistent. Digital marketing experts call it a smart, effective method to encourage customers to learn about a product or business, and then be reminded about it later, and once again for good measure.

For those aren’t entirely sure what retargeting is, the short version is that it’s the ability for an advertiser to “follow” you when you visit their site, and have their ads appear on other pages you visit after you’ve departed. The frequency varies, but it explains why ads reappear for places you just visited on the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/website-maintenance-services/"">Web</a> or social media, even though the site you’re currently connected to may not have anything to do with that particular topic.

Far more than mere coincidence, (or in case you might have envisioned an advertiser with an unlimited budget who is keenly aware of the sites you visit), retargeting is a way to constantly remind customers about a particular business.

It also works: according to <a href=""http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/11/20/15_Stats_Retargeting.html"">CMO,</a> Adobe's marketing blog, businesses typically see a 2 percent rate of people visiting and buying. But when retargeting is in place, all sorts of good things can happen, including a 400 percent increase in ad response, and 3 out of 5 buyers saying they notice ads on other sites. Those are impressive results.

Retargeting also isn’t terribly annoying –<a href=""http://digiday.com/brands/5-charts-woes-retargeting/""> 25 percent of people surveyed had a positive or very positive reaction to seeing extra ads, compared to 19 percent who dislike them, and 57 percent who are neutral on the notion of retargeting</a>.

For marketers considering adding the practice to your greater digital strategy, here’s what you should know:

&nbsp;
<h3>How retargeting works</h3>
The mechanics of retargeting ads are pretty simple. On your home page or any inside page, you include a bit of invisible Javascript code at the footer. When visitors arrive at your site, your script will send a browser cookie to their phones or desktops. When they visit other pages in the future, the cookie will instruct the page to call and display your ad in one of the page’s available ad slots.

Retargeting requires working with a remarketing company, which usually is a member of common digital ad exchanges, and can help you craft your message. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">Social media channels</a> like Facebook have their own process for targeting or retargeting, which can include ads on the right –hand column, or in your news feed.

When you establish your retargeting campaign, you’re able to configure how often your ad is displayed, be it every time visitors go to another page; or possibly, every fifth site they visit; when a certain keyword shows up (such as shoes). This also begs the question, “Does that style of ads end if the customer goes back to your site and buys something, or does it expire after a week or longer?”

<a href=""https://www.adroll.com/getting-started/retargeting"">AdRoll,</a> a popular online provider, has confirmed that different subjects can require different timing when setting-up your unique campaigns. It recommends that people seeking travel info should be retargeted immediately, while those who are more interested in specific retail goods may not need to see these ads as frequently.

Some <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeting services</a> allow you to get even more hands-on in your ad. <a href=""https://retargeter.com/blog/retargeting/self-serve-vs-full-serve-retargeter"">ReTargeter</a>, another option, said some people prefer self-serve campaigns, where they design all the aspects of their program, from the sizes of ads to where they appear. This may be better for your budget, however it may elicit more of a technical challenge than seeking a full-serve provider. The following include different types of retargeting, with varying strategies for various industries:
<h3></h3>
<h3>Health Care Retargeting</h3>
A <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/health-fact-sheet/"">Pew Research</a> study stated that 72 percent of Internet users tried to find health info during the past year. To counter the sometimes “iffy” results on various sites, there are also a variety of useful resources that have a stake in providing searchers with adequate details, including community health providers, along with plenty of pharmaceutical companies who don’t want anyone to forget their product.

According to <a href=""http://www.healthcarecommunication.com/Main/Articles/QA_What_health_care_marketers_should_know_about_re_12147.aspx"">HealthCareCommunication</a>, retargeting allows health info seekers to do their homework, while returning slightly more educated about a specific topic. For instance, an individual may visit a site for their local doctor or hospital to learn about a particular procedure, and then, in turn, visit other sites to explore the topic further. Following all of this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">research</a>, seekers will be prepared to be return to their initial site, hopefully with more knowledge.

Providers are advised to include a call to action – ask people to do something – and not have a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">retargeting campaign</a> last longer than 30 days.
<h3>Hospitality/Tourism Retargeting</h3>
We’re all familiar with the frugal traveler who goes out of his/her way to spend as little as possible when on the road. On the other hand, there are those who stimulate the local economy with plenty of purchases of food and lodging, car rentals, souvenirs, and other expenditures. Either way, much of a traveler’s research is performed online, especially when comparing prices and making reservations.

If you’re a travel business, <a href=""http://www.tnooz.com/article/three-top-tips-for-remarketing-techniques-in-travel/"">Trooz,</a> a travel marketing site, suggests that a retargeting service can help you partner with other related businesses, especially of the higher-priced variety. That way, if you represent an inexpensive B&amp;B, you may still target customers who visit airfare or local travel sites. In addition, you might also consider a service that includes international visitors.

Restaurants, another part of the industry, also have the potential to reap benefits. <a href=""http://www.restaurantnews.com/5-easy-ways-to-go-about-marketing-a-restaurant/"">Restaurantnews.com</a> confirms that those who click on your ads will already be familiar with you and what you offer, resulting in a stronger lead, rather simply than trying to tell the world that your brand exists. Throw in a coupons or a deal, and position your company in an even more exciting manner to fellow restaurant fans.
<h3>Retail Retargeting</h3>
Here’s where retargeting/remarketing really is a winner. If an item catches a shoppper’s eye, but he/she say “better not,” retargeting gives brands a second, third, and even fourth chance to talk the potential buyer into their purchase. Since so much of shopping can be deemed an impulse buy, a merchant can retarget shoppers by frequency alone, with phrases such as, “Are you sure?”, or, “Are you still thinking about these snazzy boots?” In addition, retargeting can be used to highlight items in an online shopping cart that that a prospective purchaser may have abandoned. With a reminder that the items are still waiting to be purchased, it’s not as difficult to successfully complete the transaction.

Based on the popularity of retargeting, there’s plenty of potential to include it as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">component of your marketing plan</a>. Some experts warn not to rely too much on this singular service at the expense of other marketing options, but it has the potential to help extend your reach and politely nudge your audience in a desired direction.

The demystification of the conversion marketing matrix,"As the marketing landscape has evolved over the years, so have the expectations for more quantifiable success metrics. Considering that marketing is the precursor to sales, it’s no surprise that measuring advertising reach, impressions, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand/product awareness</a>, are no longer satisfactory results in the justification of return on investment. The swift journey through the sales funnel is of paramount importance to businesses today and optimizing the number of sales conversions is a core measurement in evaluating the success of any marketing program.

Venture capitalist Bill Gurley, formerly one of Wall Street's top Internet analysts (he was the lead analyst on the Amazon.com initial public offering), wrote that conversion rates are ""the most powerful Internet metric of all"" in a Fortune magazine article. While there is plenty of discussion out there with respect to conversion marketing through digital and online channels, most fail to integrate offline conversions to the mix. I’m as excited as anyone about the opportunities that digital marketing offers brands however, it would be careless of us to ignore the fact that a large amount of people still convert to a lead, prospect, customer, and sales through traditional methods. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">Conversions on a website</a> are certainly important whether or not there is any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce</a>, but the brick and mortars also seek to drive qualified traffic into their locations for some desired in-store conversion. A successfully implemented conversion marketing program should consider both online and offline platforms as well as interplaying the two. For example, a conversion funnel may begin with entry through online channels with the completion requiring an in-store visit or vise versa.

In order to better understand how conversion marketing works, it’s important to understand its inner mechanics. Conversion is part science and part art that relies on understanding the psychology and process of persuasion and adapting it to the associated medium. It requires that close attention by paid to the point of action (POA), because objections should be answered at the point the customers are getting ready to take an action. That is where they experience their greatest cognitive dissonance, and so that is where your persuasive answers have the most impact. Additionally, the AIDA (attention, interest, desire, and action) test should be applied, as it is instrumental in driving the process of turning visitors into buyers or curiosity into action.
<h3>Examples of POA:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Customer privacy statement on online purchase by submit button</li>
 	<li>A toll-free number to call with questions and problems</li>
 	<li>Confirm and provide follow up communications to every purchase</li>
 	<li>Clearly indicate the return policy at the final sales conversion point</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of AIDA:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In-store POP or online store page with compelling messaging that grabs attention within eight seconds or less</li>
 	<li>Messaging that is personally relevant so as to stimulate their interest and reinforce that they’re in the right place</li>
 	<li>Emotionally driven and inspirational triggers that drive their desire to take action</li>
 	<li>Clearly visible and easy to understand call-to-action (CTA) and action completion information</li>
</ul>
The psychological elements of conversion balance the scientific methodology and should not be underscored. An understanding of human behavior here is key. At its root, human beings are driven by the need to avoid pain and the desire to gain pleasure. Even when we do something that appears to be painful, we do it because we associate pleasure with the action.

Firefighters run into burning buildings because they associate pleasure with helping people and saving lives. Likewise, marathoners put themselves through 26.2 miles of misery because they associate pleasure with completing the course.

In conversion marketing, you need to first <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">understand what your customers associate with</a> pain and pleasure, because not everyone associates pleasure with helping people from a burning building or running a marathon. Once you understand who they are, what they want, and what influences them, you can apply what is called the A to Z Technique. Simply put, customers want to get from point A (where they are now) to point Z (where they want to be). Carefully constructed marketing communications should help guide leads through this journey, getting the customers gradually closer to Z with each touchpoint or step. The closer they get to Z, the more likely they are to make a purchase in order to go the final few steps needed to arrive at their desired end result. Through this process, they start to associate the business with the pleasure they get from the results produced as they arrive at all the milestones between A and Z.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we have developed the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Conversion Matrix&#x2122; (BCM) which is a methodology used to identify an audience, set success metrics and finally drive them through a conversion funnel.

Once a conversion marketing program is actively running and generating results, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">regular analysis</a> and measurement is required to ensure that the rate of conversion is constantly increasing with an ultimate goal of converting 100% of all visitors and leads. This is what’s called conversion optimization or conversion rate optimization (CRO). In this BCM model, the CRO program rounds out all five steps in the activation phase.

5 interesting content ideas for healthcare marketing success,"Modern health providers interested in educating their patients in today’s world face challenges.

First, they have to be cautious of the information they provide. HIPAA, the rules which govern patient privacy, require providers to exercise care in not revealing patient information without permission, or potentially face violations <a href=""http://www.healthcarebusinesstoday.com/three-ways-you-shouldnt-be-sharing-information-with-patients/"">in the hundreds or thousands</a>.

Providers also may be hesitant to spend their time - or that of their staff members - on healthcare marketing efforts, since these initiatives aren’t directly tied into billable patient time.

Along the school of thought, the need for reliable information from trusted sources is also especially critical, and who can be deemed a more trustworthy source than one’s local doctor? For this reason, many physicians have the capacity to reach many patients quickly using more efficient modern digital methods - versus trying to educate patients on an individual basis.

Medical marketers in search of ways to inform patients in the most timely manner should try to incorporate the following five tried and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">true strategies</a> into their overall efforts:
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>1. Electronic newsletters</h3>
These can offer fresh content about general medical info, including details specific to a particular location or business. For instance, a monthly edition could consist of topics such as medical precautions people could be taking, or different health information for a certain time of year. Personal touches are also a good idea to boost engagement and generate interest, including staff bios, details about the local office, or other noteworthy activities.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>2. Social media</h3>
Common channels like Facebook or Twitter receive high traffic and statistically speaking, have many active users. They’re also easy media to be used to track the volume of visitors and interactions/engagements on your business’ pages. Both sites are also good avenues to grow rapport and loyalty. You, or whomever you delegate management of your social media efforts to within your staff or agency, can share interesting health articles from external sources, provide info about office “happenings”, promote events, and try to engage with your customers/supporters through online discussion. The tone on Facebook can actually be quite casual – in fact, sometimes all you need to post for effective content marketing is a fun picture to accompany a simple message.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>3. Business blog</h3>
A blog attached to your main site has the potential to offer more in-depth information about local, national and international health topics, including longer paragraphs than you would have room for on your social network pages (the <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3028656/work-smart/the-proven-ideal-length-of-every-tweet-facebook-post-and-headline-online"">best practices for length</a> of Facebook posts are less than 40 characters, and less than 100 for Twitter.) A blog, especially one with rich and regularly updated content, may also increase a visitor’s time on your site, rather than simply inviting quick verification of basic info such as phone numbers, appointment processes, and details about the clinic.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>4. Regular texting</h3>
Since more and more people are using their mobile phones, texting is becoming a preferred outreach method, at least for some recipients. While the 160-character limit doesn’t necessarily lend itself to complex and detailed information, you might consider including links to other interesting health articles or good links within your blog/site to boost engagement and position your practice as a thought leader.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>5. Podcasts</h3>
Though time-intensive, podcasts have the capacity to reap good pay-offs in terms of interest, and being seen as provider open to connecting in new ways. A podcast is a short audio segment that you record and make available to anyone who wants to subscribe. Your podcast may last for only 5-10 minutes, although some go longer, and yours can grow in length once you’ve established your production. Typically, podcasters interview other experts, or often, simply host with no guest interaction. This forum presents the perfect opportunity to offer a personal perspective on health topics proactively, rather than allowing patients misjudge medical information by reading and perceiving something inaccurately via mainstream news. A podcast is also the perfect place to say “that article wasn’t quite right.”  For instance, a recent study eluded to the negative health benefits of sitting for long periods, and news outlets went wild with scary headlines. The Mayo Clinic tried to <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005"">offer a better perspective</a> by explaining that the actual study included other risk factors. A trusted provider can make sense of a study and inform listeners to the real concerns that might be of harm to them. In this case, the podcaster can offer a more positive and reassuring message, such as “here’s how being active provides daily health benefits.”</li>
</ol>
Overall, the abundance of information online presents plenty of opportunities for local health providers to offer valuable, accurate expertise.

5 Social media marketing tips for restaurant owners,"Despite the potential for success, buying and operating a restaurant can be deemed one of the biggest risks out there - which is why we're here to help you out with 5 restaurant marketing tips for social media.

Various studies show a failure rate of between 60 to 90 percent, with a big chunk washing out during the first year, and an <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/why-restaurants-fail-so-often-2014-2"">even bigger percentage</a> taking up to five years to face their demise. And then, of course, even if you’re fortunate enough to outlast this risky period, you’ll still have to apply plenty of elbow grease through hard work, perhaps even working even harder than you’d ever imagined, to ensure stability for the long haul.

Various restaurant pros are quick to offer advice on how to keep the lights on and your guests happy, and it’s also equally easy for these same dining aficionados to identify points of perceived weakness - especially after a restaurant crashes and burns (hopefully not literally).

These 5 restaurant marketing tips for possessing a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">strong social media presence</a> can assist your restaurant brand in getting the word out. It may not be able to help with financing and cash flow, which is <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/marccompeau/2013/12/03/restaurants-dont-fail-lenders-do/"">why some lenders avoid restaurants</a> altogether, but it will assist you in your marketing efforts. In fact, successful <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media marketing</a> can help boost awareness, interest, and general loyalty, which all can be factors in getting prospective diners excited to serve as patrons at your establishment.

Though some social media marketing experts may suggest first creating a channel on every main social network, this may prove to be a bit of a challenge. In any case, the reasoning may be sound: to reach a larger number of users who may avoid certain platforms. For instance, if you rely solely on Facebook, you will exclude those who deliberately choose not to use this social channel. However, a big mistake that’s easy to make right out of the gate, is to create numerous pages on each channel, and then not maintain any of them. If you find yourself in this situation, it might make more sense to identify a select few social outlets, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">manage your presence adequately and regularly on each</a>. Longtime studies of online behavior for social media marketing of businesses suggest that there is often a push to create pages for a new company, but then these same pages become dusty from lack of consistent effort. The most important restaurant marketing tip for social media is that you must maintain your social media presence and engage your fans.

Here are some other useful restaurant marketing tips for utilizing social media:
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>1. Pictures of food</h3>
Though people are interested in what prospective diners might think about an establishment (good or bad), they may get especially excited if they can see images of what’s actually available on the menu. For this reason alone, visually-oriented sites like Instagram or Tumblr are perfect for showing exactly what will appear on a restaurant patron’s plate. Photo channels can be used to continuously add menu items, or perhaps showcase the day’s special. Photos can also encourage restaurant-goers to take photos of their meal and upload them to their personal pages, with special incentives for tagging the restaurant. (Even more bonus points can be accumulated if servers/hostesses assist in staging photos, ensuring that food items appear in the most appealing manner for both the diner – and, in turn, for the restaurant.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">You’re not limited to Instagram</a> and Tumbr, as sites such as Facebook and Twitter also allow inclusion of photos of delectable menu items. A study by Facebook shared with <a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/photos-generate-engagement-research/"">Social Media Examiner</a> stated that photos are one of the most effective ways to engage your readers – this compared to links, status updates, video, or even photo albums.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>2. Offer online coupons</h3>
Online coupons may be made available directly from your page, or be provided to participating diners via text or email links delivered on a regular basis. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">Offering exclusive discounts</a> might serve as an incentive encourage diners to enroll to receive your texts, or for your VIP club, especially if the registration process isn’t too complex. Promotion of this service can also carry over to your Facebook page for cross-promotion. Although coupons may result in smaller profits per item, you have the potential to make up for diner discounts as a result of the increased number of visitors coming through your doors.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>3. Go beyond traditional food service in your restaurant marketing</h3>
By using Pinterest, your page might be used to offer information about where your food comes from, or to offer some fun step-by-step recipes with before and after photos. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/web-video-production-agency/"">A YouTube page</a> has equal added benefits, for instance, including instructional video of one of your chefs preparing one of your signature items, or possibly, a popular dessert. Along the same lines, Snapchat images of the kitchen crew can showcase your restaurant <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">team’s personality</a>, and your team members having fun. Your loyal fans will love this “sneak peek” of what goes on outside of the public view. <a href=""http://restaurantengine.com/promote-restaurant-social-media/"">Restaurant Engine</a> suggests registering with Yelp, which will allow people to post reviews, and Foursquare, which allows diners to “announce” when they check-in.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>4. Cross-promote like crazy</h3>
If you’re chronicling something cool taking place on one channel, don’t forget to tell people about it on your other channels. This could be a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">Facebook contest that you cross-promote on Twitter</a>, or vice versa. If you have a blog, be sure to regularly describe any interesting events or content on the various social media channels. This will encourage people to visit each, and in essence, help to build your brand.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>5. Be responsive</h3>
A sometimes overlooked aspect of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketing</a> is actively interacting with the public.  Start by posting questions that people may enjoy answering. Be ready to respond quickly and politely if someone posts a negative experience or opinion, or asks a question on a channel.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Restaurant owners should embrace social media as an inexpensive way to reach new customers and ensure existing diners keep coming back for more of your delicious specialties.

Hello from the other side: What is social listening?,"Social listening is one of those magical, marketing buzzwords that seems to hold the key to customer information, new sales, and social engagement. But what is it? Whether you're a new digital marketer or a seasoned business owner, understanding social listening (and knowing how to use it) can be a powerful tool in your toolbox. We know that wading through the myriad of marketing blogs and platforms can be daunting, so we've stripped down the jargon and confusion to give you the real deal on social listening.
<h3>What is social listening?</h3>
Social listening is a common marketing practice that involves auditing and collecting information your customers are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">saying about your brand online</a>. This may include capturing comments about your brand on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a>, cataloging reviews, combing through news articles, or monitoring blog posts. Often times, companies will score each comment based on whether it's positive or negative, and whether it's coming from an influential source or an insignificant channel. Social listening can give business owners <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">insight</a> into the types of brand associations their customers are organically building by considering who is speaking most frequently (i.e., mommy blogs vs. trade journals) and what their conversations are about.
<h3>What do you use social listening for?</h3>
Knowing whether your customers and prospective customers have a positive or negative opinion about your products, and what other products they're comparing them to, can give you a clear picture into whether you're effectively communicating your unique value proposition. Understanding who your customers are talking to and where they are discussing your products can also help you target a better, more valuable audience and serve them information and content where they are already surfing the web. This information allows you to address customer service issues, generate leads, and encourage viral sharing depending on how you respond to your findings. Social listening gives you an inside look into your customers' mindset and helps you interact when them in a more authentic way.
<h3>Start listening in now</h3>

The biggest question to ask when starting a website design project,"As a business owner, there are many questions you should ask yourself before embarking on a website design project, including: “what kind of <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/cms-development/"">website development platform</a> do you want to use?”,  “do you want to hire a web design specialist or build the site yourself?’, “are you willing to spend money on <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing/display-advertising/"">digital advertising</a>?”, and many more. The single biggest factor you should consider before <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">starting a website design project</a>, however, is the purpose of your site. Defining the purpose of your website can seem like a deceptively simple task, but your goals for the site can have a profound impact on how you approach your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">website design project</a>.

To help you get started, we've outlined the top three most common goals for new websites. Before you ask yourself any other website design questions, tackle this one. You can use your response as a framework for the rest of your project.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>1. Company information and brand awareness</h3>
</li>
</ol>
One of the most common purposes of many websites is to provide general information about an organization and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">build brand awareness</a>. In this instance, your site would provide insight into your organizational history, values, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand personality.</a> These types of sites tend to use more traditional web design principles and easy-to-use information architecture so consumers can quickly find what they are looking for. If this is the goal for your website design project, you should feel comfortable using standard menu options and crafting content-rich pages packed with pictures and information. Just remember, your most important information should be front and center on the homepage to ensure newcomers get a clear first impression of your business. This is your opportunity to show off your company's tone and establish a unique voice that resonates with your customers, so don't be afraid to let your personality shine.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h3>2. Searchability and SEO ranking</h3>
</li>
</ol>
On the other hand, if your goal is to make it easier for new customers to find your business, you may want to consider basing your website design project strategy around <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/seo-and-the-first-page-of-google/"">SEO</a> principles. Search engines such as Google and Bing are the Yellow Pages of the internet. When <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">customers search</a> for words associated with your business, you want your website to show up first. Although you probably won't have trouble ranking at the top of Google's recommendations on brand-specific words such as your company name, you may be competing with many other companies on more general terms, such as the type of products or services you offer. Increase your chances of ranking by including internal and external links to relevant information and other websites associated with your top search keywords. Make sure your website text includes specific, relevant information about these terms so search engines can easily recognize and index what your site is about. You may also consider building a blog with your site to help establish your search ranking more quickly.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h3>3. E-commerce sales platform</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Are you primarily planning to do business on your website? If so, you'll need a credible, secure <a href=""http://ecommerce-platforms.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">e-commerce platform</a>. If you want your customers to buy products or schedule services and make payments online, your website design questions will focus largely on the type of platform you need and the security of your clients' information. That isn't to say the branding and content on your site isn't important in this case, but rather, that your purchase flows will need a lot of extra love. Consumers often chose <em>not</em> to buy a product online if the e-commerce experience looks outdated, runs slowly, is confusing, or seems like it is not secure. If your goal is to conduct business and drive sales, your online purchase experience should be at the top of your to-do list.

Framing your website design project questions around your site goals will ensure your website accomplishes what you need it to do. Then, once the foundation of your website project is complete, you can begin layering on additional functionality such as social engagement and new, digital technologies. Still have lingering questions before you begin your website project? <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact our team</a> of web development experts to get started with ease!",,1/14/2016 13:40,39,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the_single_biggest_question_when_starting_website_project.jpg,website-design-project-question,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

Super Bowl 50 commercials countdown #1: Acura NSX – What He Said,"<p class=""p1"">Originally published on BrandBlab on February 1st, 2016.</p>
In the first of our countdown toward the Super Bowl commercials, we take a look at the Acura NSX.

The car that adorned many 12 year-old boys' posters during the 90’s is back! Acura is returning to the super-car field by bringing back the NSX. The original NSX, which stands for New Sports car Xperimental, began production in 1990 and was left largely unchanged cosmetically until the end of its original production run in 2005. So it seems, the new NSX brings back much of the same style that made it popular in the first place: long sleek lines, low profile, and namely - the visible rear-engine.

The NSX has a hefty price tag of $156,000 so it’s unlikely that the average viewer will be rushing out to buy one. However, if Acura will be measuring its success based on how much audience saliva was generated by watching this commercial versus automotive sales, would you say they were successful?

It’s nice to see Acura return to the center stage of television commercials, but I’m not sure that this spot will be as memorable as others have been. They inject Van Halen’s “Runnin’ with Devil” to build excitement and replace any need for a voice over script. Still, I’m left with mixed feelings. The car looks sexy, Google search tells me that I can’t afford it, and now I am reminded of that Van Halen song. Hmm, perhaps I should go listen to some Van Halen on Spotify right now?

While entertaining, I can't say this placement would make it on our BIG LIST of Super Bowl advertisements. Especially since according to a National Retail Federation study, <a href=""http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/268084/super-bowl-viewers-see-ads-as-entertainment-first.html"">over 77% of viewers see Super Bowl commercials as pure entertainment</a>. This sets an incredibly high standard for advertisers to not only capture the attention of their viewers as they're equally distracted by other party shenanigans or looking down from the TV during a commercial break to check their Facebook. It also requires that they keep consumers entertained while maintaining their attention. This conundrum oftentimes causes creative teams to overlook the primary purpose of any advertisement: to sell the brand.

If consumers aren’t <em>more</em> motivated to support a brand after a commercial, then advertisers just dropped a couple million bucks for a good ole' fashion chuckle. Or, if things get “overly creative,” advertisers invest a significant amount of resources to either confuse or bore their viewers. And, in the worst-case scenario, which occurred with <a href=""http://www.talentzoo.com/beneath-the-brand/blog_news.php?articleID=9607"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Groupon</a> during the 2011 Super Bowl, their ad just simply pisses people off.

Either way, Acura's ad is indeed sexy, which is to be expected for a super-car. But at the steep price tag of $156,000, wouldn't you consider a Maserati or a Ferrari?  Perhaps that's a conversation for later.

Bring on the beer commercials! We're off to jam to Van Halen.

3 ways to keep your company culture in a growing business,"Growing advertising agencies, tech companies, and startups build and maintain great talent by creating a company culture that entices and engages the best employees. If you're a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">forward-thinking creative marketing agency</a>, employees may enjoy a relaxed dress code and flexible hours. Tech savvy millennials may enjoy the freedom to work remotely, collaborate in a communal space, and spend time exploring their professional passions. Giving team members individual attention and shifting policies and procedures to sustain your culture is easy when there are only a handful of passionate, dedicated employees to please. But what happens when your company begins to grow? As we've flexed and adapted to our growing company size, we've learned a few tips and tricks to keep the culture alive along the way. Here are our top three recommendations on how to stay true to your roots while growing.
<h2><strong>1. Understand what values your brand embodies:</strong></h2>
As your company grows, take time to step back and evaluate the type of values your organization embraces most naturally. Growing advertising agencies often put a premium on creativity and results; but push this notion farther. What inspires your employees? What types of clients do you gravitate toward? Whether your ideals center around collaboration, pushing boundaries, helping others, or flexibility, knowing what your company represents at its core will help you craft policies around those ideals to sustain the culture that attracted your first employees.
<h2><strong>2. Put policies in place that make your company culture a procedure:</strong></h2>
Once you clearly understand your organizational values, you can begin putting policies in place that protect your culture. Ensure these policies are enforceable and measurable (i.e., employees can spend 10% of their time on their creative portfolios). It's also crucial that your employees have the authority to act on these policies across the board. For example, if your culture embraces a flat decision structure, team members at all levels of the organization need to be able to make changes within their sphere of influence.
<h2><strong>3.  Know the market:</strong></h2>
Lastly, pressure test the policies you've put in place against the market. Although your company culture may be unique to you, other growing advertising agencies or startups may share similar values. Consider how they foster a positive culture, even if it isn't identical to the environment you're trying to create. Understanding how other companies are treating their employees will help you understand what your top talent is looking for in terms of culture, benefits, compensation, and lifestyle. This will help you protect and retain talent, as well as encourage longer tenure within your organization that will strengthen and build on the culture that already exists.

3 marketing myths that make millennials hate your brand,"The holy grail of marketing to millennials has been debunked! Not that you should be surprised – millennials love to break (bend, change, or influence) the rules. Slapping a few digital ads on social media and running deep discounts to hook and book today’s largest emerging consumer demographic is no longer enough. To create a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">successful millennial marketing campaign</a> that will engage and grow this audience, it’s important to understand what they value and how they like to interact with brands. On the flip side, it’s equally – if not more – important to understand what doesn’t work for this group. As the Baby Boomers retire and Generation X continues to take a backseat to the very visible, loud and proud “x, y” generation, unpacking the marketing psychology that drives millennials will become increasingly important. We’ve debunked three of the most common millennial myths that plague brands and drive this critical demographic away.
<h2><strong>Marketing to millennials myth 1: They are cheap and narcissistic </strong></h2>
With the advent of “cheap chic” fashion trends, thanks in large part to popular discount brands like Target and H&amp;M, it’s not surprising that the general population believes millennials are overly consumed with the appearance of wealth and trendiness (minus the price tag). A solid marketing agency often translates this into either discounts and rebates, or campaigns that imitate luxury brands while visibility toting their lower prices. Although many millennials struggled to find post-graduate employment after the recession in 2008, they are bouncing back with the economy and finding themselves with a sudden influx of disposable income thanks to booming startups, fast-paced tech agencies, and non-traditional employment opportunities. <a href=""http://www.millennialmarketing.com/who-are-millennials/#slide-3"">Almost 50% of millennials are more willing to buy a product if it supports a good cause</a>. The critical emphasis on this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">research</a> is that millennials are not only more willing to buy a product that contributes to a greater cause in some way, but to actually choose it over more expensive alternatives that don’t support similar initiatives. This type of research suggests that millennials are neither cheap nor narcissistic, but in fact are more than willing to pay for the right product and the right brand.

Take Love Your Melon, for example. They are able to charge a premium cost for a simple product because they speak to millennial ideals, not their vanity or bank accounts. Love Your Melon is an apparel brand dedicated to giving a hat to every child battling cancer in America as well as supporting nonprofit organizations that lead the fight against pediatric cancer. Pretty inspiring, right? Love Your Melon has built their business on millennials and their mission is the reason why they’ve been so successful at it. Maybe it’s time to consider ditching the promotion in favor for a buy one, give one (to a community in need) campaign.
<h2><strong>Marketing to millennials myth 2: The best way to reach them is social media</strong></h2>
Marketing to millennials has long hinged on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">social media campaigns,</a> pop up or in-<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">app advertising</a>, and digital outreach. However, this hyper-connected generation finds great satisfaction in discovering the world when they are unplugged and engaging with it. This is an untapped territory for brands looking to break through the clutter. 48% of millennials say they would (and could) happily function without their smartphone or digital devices according to Retailing Today. While many millennial myths want you to believe that this generation can’t (and won’t) interact with a brand unless it’s bombarding them online, many millennials discover brands at the top of the funnel when they’re unplugged, exploring, and experiencing. This type of organic discovery leads to deeper brand loyalty and longer lifetime value. We aren’t suggesting getting rid of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing"">digital marketing</a> campaigns, we’re just simply advocating that you add in a few guerrilla or grassroots tactics that reach this audience in the real-world environment they so crave in today’s hyper-digital world. Think: Coca-Cola’s <a href=""http://www.522productions.com/spotlight-case-study-coca-cola-happiness-phone-booth"">happiness phone booths </a>or <a href=""http://puzzlelondonsport.com/red-bulls-success-sponsorship/"">Redbull’s partnership </a>with extreme sporting events.
<h2><strong>Marketing to millennials myth 3: They can be somewhat transactional</strong></h2>
One of the most deadly millennial myths results from the culmination of the previous two myths. Marketing to millennials should, first and foremost, hinge on expressing your brand’s value proposition and ideals. Contrary to popular belief, millennials are not transactional shoppers. According to <a href=""http://eventbrite-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/marketing/Millennials_Research/Gen_PR_Final.pdf"">Medallion Research</a>, millennials are not nearly as concerned with money and status as they are with relationships and experiences. This dovetails from the idea that millennials are not cheap or narcissistic. They don’t care about the product, they care about the brand and lifestyle it’s associated with. When selling consumer packaged goods or services, this may seem difficult to surmount, but when you step back and look at the success of Apple’s “Think Differently” campaign, it becomes clear that products – whatever they may be – are simply an expression of this generation’s values. So make sure your brand values speak loud and clear. As was the case with Apple, you may need to expressly spell this out for the new generation. But, the results will be well worth the effort.

Simple, right? Marketing to millennials really comes down to two things: Say something about your brand and make sure it’s authentic they’ll sort out the rest.

Generate traffic to your resort website with content marketing,"Resort marketing still continues to largely hinge on a flawless content strategy: you have to have the photos, the reviews, the descriptions, and some seriously intriguing copy that makes website visitors want to become<em> real</em> visitors. In addition to the obvious benefits of engaging and converting web traffic, content marketing can generate even more traffic to your resort website by boosting <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO rankings</a> and viral traffic.

Here are some tried and true industry insights that'll be sure to help pump up your SEO rankings and generate more traffic to your site.
<h2><strong>CONTENT MARKETING MEETS SEO RANKING: </strong></h2>
We've all heard the same ole' song that <a href=""http://www.craigbailey.net/content-is-king-by-bill-gates/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">content is king</a> - well, it is. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">Strong, relevant, and consistent website content</a> boosts your SEO ranking on two fronts, branded terms (i.e., your resort name) and non-branded terms like geo-specific data (i.e., Jamaica resort, tropical hotel, etc.). Working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing agency</a> to develop a better understanding of the right terms for your brand, which is always based on your search budget and competitive set, will give you a crystal-clear roadmap to success. Use those terms to tag your photos and build out your property descriptions, and as search engines crawl your site, having these terms in your copy will ensure your resort appears relevant and pops up when tourists are searching for related terms. Of course, the more your resort appears in search results (and the higher it ranks), the more traffic will hit your website. Within your site, you can also <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">link to deeper pages within your web ecosystem</a> or link outwardly to relevant website authorities such as bloggers and review sites to encourage better search rankings. Although SEO efforts aren't as tangible as other agency marketing efforts, they can absolutely make or break how much traffic your website receives. Which in turn, has a huge effect on your business. And remember, you multi-million dollar resort and its respective website are only as good as the traffic that finds it.
<h2><strong>OUTWARD BOUND - CONTENT MARKETING AND VIRAL TRAFFIC: </strong></h2>
Although it can feel incredibly time consuming, blogging is one of the single most important <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">content marketing strategies</a> to boost traffic to your resort website. By actively blogging about relevant content related to the resort industry, you become an authority on your travel destination. Blog as a guest expert on other sites, publish your posts in an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email newsletter</a>, share them on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, get the word out. The more shareable your content is, the more likely it is to be ... well ... shared. If your in-house team is too small, consider working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">content marketing agency</a> to generate and post blog entries. Not only can these agencies write on your behalf, but they can help you determine where to post your content and who to reach out to, ultimately ensuring your articles are seen. Regardless of your budget, most agencies will work with you to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">build a successful strategy</a>. A good rule of thumb is that you should post at least one to two articles per week that include approximately 500-600 words and several instances of your primary keywords. The added bonus of creating highly shareable content is that it also supports your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO strategy</a>. And that my friends, is what we call a two-for-one.

We can't stress enough that content helps potential customers understand your brand and drives new visitors to the top of your exploration funnel. Keeping this content up-to-date is important to ensure your site stays relevant to both your audience and search engines. Your website is never ""done"" and there is always more content to be written, fresh news to share, and new traffic to entice by updating your content on a regular basis.  So get to writing - go ahead, unleash your creativity - and don't plan to stop!

Why marketing to tourists is now like online dating,"No, you didn't read that wrong. We did indeed just say that marketing to tourists is a lot like online dating. Stick with us on this metaphor and we'll show you how to turn transactional tourism marketing into a full blown love affair with your restaurant, hotel, resort or travel destination. And, since the tourism industry accounts for over a <em>trillion </em>dollars in the U.S. economy alone (according to the Travel Industry Association) we're willing to bet that's one relationship worth investing in.
<h2><strong>NEVER UNDERESTIMATE A GOOD ""PROFILE PICTURE:"" </strong></h2>
If you, or your friends, have ever prepared for a date with someone you met online, you probably know the legitimate fear that your date won't look anything like his or her photos. Unsurprisingly, that same fear exists when tourists are vetting travel destinations. Travel savvy globe trotters have wised up. They are painfully aware that a good tourism digital marketing agency knows how to take photos that make rooms look larger, food look fresher, and spas feel more luxurious. To ensure your marketing to tourists doesn't ring flat, make sure your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">pictures are up to date</a> and capture different angles of your business while integrating user-generated photos that ""verify"" the pictures your brand has taken. A good way to do this may be to include an Instagram feed using a simple API call, or curating a ""photo of the day"" on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">your website</a> pulled from your social media feeds. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">Research</a> (from Search Engine Watch to Forbes) has proven again and again that photos are the single most important element tourists rely on when making travel decisions. Therefore, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> should be extremely photo-heavy (who has time to read these days anyway?) and showcase your business's best elements. But, authenticity is incredibly valued, so don't be afraid to show a hint of the ""not so good"" so your customers' expectations match their experience.
<h2><strong>THE POWER OF A FRIEND'S APPROVAL:</strong></h2>
The internet gives us the incredible (and creepy) ability to learn a whole hell-of-a lot about our dates before we actually meet them. We can search for their jobs, social connections, driving record (if that means anything to you), accolades, where our worlds intersect - nothing is so thrilling as discovering that your soon-to-be online date shares mutual friends. Because that means you'll probably be able to get some insider information on their ""real"" dating style. Love it or hate it, the same holds true in the tourism marketing world. Tourists can unearth a ridiculous amount of information about your service, cleanliness, value, and hospitality through <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">online reviews and social media</a>. Don't fight it. Embrace your reviewers and try to encourage positive reviews while honestly and openly responding to negative feedback. Hiring a tourism digital marketing agency to monitor the tone and trends surrounding your brand's online conversation can also help you determine where there are genuine areas for improvement to refine your brand experience. Consider <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">partnering with bloggers and social media influencers</a> to highlight their experience with your brand. By giving these trendsetters a voice and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">featuring them on your website</a>, you'll be able to  generate a positive social effect and build trust in your brand.

Why we don't suggest Super Bowl commercials for our clients,"The Super Bowl has long been considered the pinnacle of football season, and similarly, Super Bowl commercials are often considered the pinnacle of television advertising.

Super Bowl commercials – especially those early on in the game – can create enormous buzz that has the potential to linger for months, if not years. Whether or not the game is a snooze-fest or a blowout, people will always be talking about the products and their commercials.

Super Bowl commercials for beer have become legendary, as have food and soft drinks. New car models are revealed, and it’s a perfect time for “exclusive” sneak peeks of new movies and shows - even though broadcasting to millions of viewers means the exact opposite of exclusive. I digress.

So the question is, should every product or service aim for a Super Bowl presence?

Nope!

For one thing Super Bowl commercials come with an enormous price tag. <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/super-bowl-ad-tracker-everything-we-know-about-2016s-commercials-168657"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">AdWeek</a> indicated that in 2016, the price for a 30-second chunk of airtime is at least $5 million, an 11 percent increase since last year. As smart advertisers will tell you, one ad won’t be nearly as effective as several, as frequency and advertising regularity helps to get you noticed and maintain user recognition.

So unless you’re already a powerhouse brand like the Coca-Cola or Budweiser, you may be a little hesitant on shelling out a year's worth of marketing dollars for one campaign.

To speak to the importance of target audiences, Super Bowl viewers are also about as general as you can get. The figure has fluctuated <a href=""http://heavy.com/sports/2016/02/super-bowl-commercial-cost-2016-ad-how-much-money-expensive-value/"">from 39 million <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to 114.4 mil</span> viewers over the years</a> with some – key wording being “some” - viewers of this mass audience likely needing and wanting your product. However, there’s an overwhelming reality that majority of the viewers won’t even be interested.

If you’re a smaller company, it’s imperative to have a strong idea of your audience and target customers with a solid marketing strategy in place. Due to the nature of your audience, the exposure to a wider viewer base may not even be that beneficial in the long run.

Perhaps it might make more sense to focus your marketing efforts in other areas like: training your team to provide better customer service, making sure your employees have the latest skills and technology they need to be successful, or pursuing various community efforts to build positive brand recognition within your networks.

But, if you – or your decision-makers – are firm on “wanting to do something for the Super Bowl,” there are still many ways to get creative, like tying your marketing efforts into “the big game.” (The NFL is pretty choosy who can use ‘Super Bowl’ in their promotions.) You could also consider incorporating football themes and terms into your social media strategies to pull traction back to your business.

All in all, while we all enjoy the entertainment value of Super Bowl commercials, from a pure advertising point of view, perhaps it may be wiser to allocate your $5 million on other hyper-focused, market validated avenues.

"Welp, Super Bowl is over: Crush 2017 using 3 ad campaign ideas","People all around America celebrate the Super Bowl in approximately one of three ways:
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>1.</strong> The over zealous football fan throws a party for all of his best friends. He smears paint all over his face, wears his favorite (“lucky”, probably smelly) jersey, stocks the refrigerator full with beer and makes so many chicken wings it seems impossible that they will all be eaten (but don’t worry, they will be).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>2.</strong> You have the neighbor/friend/spouse etc. that knows nothing about football. But they follow the crowd, go to the party for the free food, and pretend they know why, exactly, grown men are running into each other.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>3.</strong> The best people (we like to include ourselves in this category) may go to the party, or they may not. Favorite game-time snack and beverage in hand, these people watch the game patiently. <i>Anytime now, </i>they think. Leaning forward in their seats, they hush everyone in the room. A commercial break has finally arrived. It’s Super Bowl ad time, and the real game is about to begin.</p>
The Super Bowl, with one of the highest ratings in all of U.S. TV history, the lure of high, and often engaged, viewership is too strong for advertisers to ignore. The Super Bowl has seen some of the best - and worst - ads in its 50 year history, creating a great database of success stories for advertising during both the big game and every other day of the year. Alas, let’s take three lessons from the game changers of the ad industry and answer the question, “what should we do for our next ad campaign in 2017?”
<h2><strong>DO: Involve your consumer </strong></h2>
Doritos’ ‘Crash the Super Bowl’ campaign is one of the best examples of this idea. A 10-year campaign, Doritos made the risky decision to outsource their most important ad dollars of the year. The ‘Crash’ campaign consists of consumer-generated content, something that was nearly unheard of -- and hard to swallow by the Doritos marketing team -- until 2006 when the strategy turned out to be a success. Widely accepted among consumers, the amateur home-videos shined a light on the potential creative of everyday consumers and created valued engagement and connection between the company and its most-valued target audience. In its 10th and final year, Doritos’ ‘Crash the Super Bowl’ campaign is sure to be a highlight of this year’s game day.

<h2><strong>DO: Try new things in your ad campaign</strong></h2>
A must watch in any intro to advertising course and widely considered one of the best ads <i>ever</i>, Apple’s ‘1984’ broke boundaries. The ad, a play on George Orwell’s popular dystopian novel, was the first of its kind and set the standard for Super Bowl advertising to come. Despite the fact that the ad almost didn’t see the light of day and faced much pushback from Apple executives, the ad made a lasting impact on both the industry and the consumer. Long gone were the days of mediocre Super Bowl advertising. Apple, a pioneer on many fronts, also became the pioneer of high-quality, large scale ad campaigns. The ad only aired one time but created a buzz so strong that people are still talking about it more than 30 years later.

https://youtu.be/OYecfV3ubP8
<h2><strong>DO: Use social media as a supplement to your ad campaign</strong></h2>
Volkswagen’s ‘The Force’ is possibly one of the <i>cutest </i>(aww) ads ever, featuring a little boy dressed as Darth Vader attempting, with little luck, to use the force on any and all things around his house. Surprised, he is (see what we did there), to find his powers work on his parents’ new VW, aided only by the remote control start his dad secretly uses from inside the house. While this ad did wonders to capture the consumer and hit a solid 10 on the cuteness scale, that is not the reason it caused buzz in the advertising industry. VW had only bought a 30-second spot in the Super Bowl, but they were convinced their best work was the full 60-second version. With no way to air the 60-second version during the game, VW made the decision to post ‘The Force’ on Youtube days before it was set to air on TV. Up until this time, Super Bowl ads were kept well under wraps and locked behind bulletproof glass (maybe not, but seems likely) to prevent early viewing and what was considered a loss of impact. VW’s early release of ‘The Force’ opened the door to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media teasing</a> and an entire new layer to the Super Bowl ad campaign frenzy.

Well, your 12 month countdown begins NOW! We hope these lessons from these game changers will help drive an awesome 2017 campaign.

#Biglove for our stellar marketing intern: Pam Bianda,"International phone calls are not cheap. But sometimes, when you’re a soon to be college senior with no agency experience and the sincere hope of becoming a copywriter – you take the call. At least that’s what I did.

Flying back from my summer in Ireland, I was beyond grateful for the opportunity to step into the culture of a <em>real</em> agency. I had no idea what I’d learn. At the very least, I hoped to be able to keep up. After six months of immersion at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, it’s safe to say that I’ve gathered more than just a surface-level understanding of how to succeed in the industry. So then, what are some tips to success as a novice/intern/apprentice? I’ll keep it simple. There are three. Though, I will argue that these will lead to heightened involvement and happiness for a professional at any level. But of course, I’m biased. Anyway, without further ado, here they are:
<h2><strong>Be curious</strong></h2>
Questions indicate curiosity. As an intern, don’t be afraid to ask. Tasks need clarification, documents need explanation and certainly, clients need interpretation. So in order to fulfill the duties asked of you, don’t feel ashamed to ask. Show that you are interested in what the agency is producing by sitting in meetings, injecting your opinion (when desired, this note is important) and coming up with creative ideas to fulfill the assignments at hand. This curiosity is the same innate force that creates great marketing. Being interested in current trends, other agencies, and pop culture feeds into the bank of inspiration for campaigns. It keeps the agency on its toes and thus, keeps clients impressed. There is an entire world of ideas waiting to be discovered if you simply ask around and do your research.
<h2><strong>Be adaptable</strong></h2>
An intern wears many hats – no surprise there. Yes, I am an Account Management and Marketing intern. But that doesn’t mean that on a busy day I won’t be asked to come up with copy for a client or edit a proposal. So, be adaptable. Use the curiosity specified above to embrace the different roles you might take on on any given day. Adaptability isn’t changing your position in the company, but it means enlarging the scope of it, which is important to remember when you’re feeling bogged down by tasks. Whether they realize it or not, professionals in the advertising industry are some of the most versatile. They represent their agency’s culture, their clients’ desires and, of course, themselves. With this multi-layered identity, it’s easy to see how adapting to create impactful messaging is natural. That’s not even covering the ever-changing technological landscape that advertisers have to adopt at every turn. So, yeah, adaptability is key.
<h2><strong>Be confident</strong></h2>
<u>This does not mean arrogant.</u> You may know a lot, but you don’t know it all. That being said, whenever you present ideas or completed tasks - take pride in them. Who will believe in you if you don’t? Cliché, I know. But if you are chosen to be a part of something (like being an intern), do yourself a favor and don’t be shy. Isn’t that the principal rule of advertising? To sell something? Well, start by selling yourself. Agencies are some of the most confident entities in the world. Clients need guidance on how to best present themselves to the intended audience. So, what do advertisers do? Concoct a killer campaign that teeters right between genius and crazy. Something (hopefully) so good that the only way the client will buy it is with confidence and assertion from the whole team. That’s how the best agencies work anyways. And that’s how you should work within your team – with confidence.

So, there you have it. The three things I’ve learned lead to success in my time at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>: curiosity, adaptability and confidence. And, of course, a damn good sense of humor.

Tiffany & Co: An industry pioneer in Valentine's Day,"It’s no secret that when February rolls around, the isles of your local supermarket turn the deepest shade of red, chocolate becomes all the more enticing, the price of flowers skyrocket, and stuffed animals, cards, mugs, and candy line every corner. These <em>not-so-subtle</em> indications remind us that Valentine’s Day is indeed upon us. As digital marketers, we're constantly exploring how brands are effectively advertising to their customers, and there’s one particular industry that is apt, dare we say it, <em>eager</em> for this season to arrive. That’s right, the jewelry industry. Let's be honest, there's really no better example of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">fresh campaign ideas</a> for the season of love than those produced by industry leader Tiffany &amp; Co. For the past few years, Tiffany’s has led with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">fantastic strategies</a>, consistently reinventing their approach to Valentine’s Day by developing new ways to attract their audience with creative, off the wall approaches. Here's a quick look at some initiatives this jewelry giant has developed, all the way to their most current 2016 campaign. We're hoping this will help inspire your next awesome Valentine’s Day <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing strategies</a>.
<h2>2012/2013: ""Drop a Hint,"" what makes love true campaign(s)</h2>
Ya know, sometimes people just don’t get the hint, and Valentine’s Day is just about the worst time to be oblivious. Picking up on this trend, Tiffany’s went ahead and made it a little easier for significant others to express gift expectations. The “Drop a Hint” campaign was a brilliant, interactive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing</a> approach to solving a seemingly ageless problem. Visitors to Tiffany &amp; Co.’s site were invited to drop a hint by pressing a heart shaped button on the screen. This would send a customizable email to their partner, which read the following:

<a href=""http://imsiobhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Tiffany.jpg"" rel=""attachment wp-att-11315""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-11315"" src=""http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tiffany.jpg"" alt=""Tiffany"" width=""651"" height=""451"" /></a>

This approach was a great way to connect customers to the company in a very direct manner. Staying cheeky and fresh as always, Tiffany &amp; Co. succeeded in delivering clients with an avenue and reason to purchase their exclusive products.

Since Biblical times/Ancient times (if that's your thing), stars have been associated with the alignment of two souls: “star-crossed lovers,” it was “written in the stars,” the references go on and on. There’s even a little book, not sure if you’ve heard about it, The Fault in Our Stars. So, yeah. Stars and love have become synonymous. This connection was something Tiffany’s picked up and ran with for its 2013 Valentine’s Day campaign. This celestial concept (carried over from 2012) allowed customers to envision their perfect piece of jewelry as a testament to the love shared between them and their significant other. As an added touch, Tiffany’s offered consumers the opportunity to submit information about themselves to create a custom postcard exemplifying their love. Twinkly stars included, of course.

<h2><strong>2014: #TiffanyValentine</strong></h2>
Creativity, charm, and a touch of magic melded together to realize Tiffany’s 2014 Valentine's campaign. The many images created for this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing campaign</a> included cartoon renditions of lovers in romantic scenes with jewelry pieces superimposed as a balcony, balloons, a hot air balloon - these were among some of the delightful scenes the ads included. These images were posted to Tiffany’s Instagram to excite followers to anticipate the upcoming holiday and inspire purchasing behavior among them. <em>Ahhh, l'amour</em>.

<h2><strong>2015: The Concierge of Love</strong></h2>
In 2015, Tiffany's launched a series of viral videos accompanied by social ads hosting facts from their Concierge’s “Love Kit.” This stood out as one of last year’s most creative multi-channel marketing approaches to Valentine's Day. The videos themselves recreate a variation of scenarios struggling gift givers find themselves in during this time of year. In this way, the videos present Tiffany products as the solution to a serious problem, like, not knowing how to say “I love you.” The complementary ads serve as a clever source of credibility for the famed Concierge as documented below. Additionally, the hashtag #conciergeoflove helped the campaign spread through social media like wildfire. Here are the ads and their related videos:

<h2><strong>2016: Love is…</strong></h2>
In 2016, Tiffany &amp; Co. nodded the amazing variety of definitions that ‘love’ can embody. And personally, this campaign is our favorite. Their “Love Is” multi-channel marketing campaign invites people to finish this line of thought. Love is: fun, unconditional, blind, letting your child have the final say, magical, intoxicating, the list goes on and on. This campaign comes right in time to celebrate the recently passed equality legislation, which allows everyone to express love however they choose and more importantly, with whomever they please. The campaign is probably the most inclusive to date because of its open-ended nature and inviting essence. Followers of Tiffany &amp; Co. on social media were encouraged to use the hashtag #loveistiffany to post their position on what they believe love is. The bold colors and graphics of this particular campaign reveal a new, edgier Tiffany’s than ever seen before. And frankly, it’s quite impressive. Take a look for yourself.

5 social media marketing tips for restaurants that really work,"For the American restaurant culture, 2015 was the year of enthusiastic nautical decor (boat ropes, life-sized buoys, natural and sustainable materials, Edison lightbulbs, contemporary color palettes), imaginative dishes including everything from briny olives to mashed potatoes to marinated pickles to Korean BBQ tacos (<em>seriously, is it time for lunch?</em>), and even more uber-elaborate cocktails with rare spirits, hand-cut herbs and artisan ice cubes.

As we enter into a new year, industry leaders recognize the continuing shift towards a more relaxed, affordable, intimate, and collaborative dining experience. Culinary enthusiasts are seeking out restaurants that provide extremely friendly price points while also expecting a higher quality product. So as the competition continues to increase and evolve, it's absolutely imperative for restaurant brands to maintain a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">strong social media presence</a> that keeps them authentically engage with their audience. Here are five social media marketing tips from our team that will help you maximize your efforts:
<h2>Consistency is key:</h2>
Maintaining consistency on your digital channels is about more than the frequency of your message. Maintaining a consistent tone in your tweets, Facebook, and LinkedIn updates, while understanding your unique audience segments on each platform - is key. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">Developing and creating consistent</a>, <em>relevant</em>, content is a ton of work, so it's far better to start slow and steady. Despite popular belief that everything you post will go ""viral,"" a true social media marketing strategy should focus on long-term efforts - slow and steady wins the race! Also, by following this rule of thumb, this will provide your followers with a realistic expectation of when they will hear from you, creating a pattern of user behavior in respect to your brand.
<h2>Think visually:</h2>
We know that visual content is far more effective and leads to increased engagement, especially on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BIGEYEagency/photos/pb.188820844482065.-2207520000.1456423624./1101945559836251/?type=3&amp;theater"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Facebook</a>, and restaurants are at a unique advantage because the products their customers care about most can be displayed visually. It's an easy sell. So, take photos of your product! Leverage highly visual channels like: Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and even Snapchat. Craft cocktails are in, and here to stay, so give your viewers what they want to see - your delicious food and awesome cocktails.
<h2>Control the conversation:</h2>
Your social media team members should be willing and ready to respond to questions and comments at anytime. Companies like Jet Blue, Nike, Air Asia, Starbucks, and Whole Foods <strong>rock</strong> <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">customer service on social media</a>. JetBlue makes it a point to respond not just to customers who @mention them, but also to customers who talk about the brand in general - even if they weren't tagged in the post. This means that the company's social media team is tracking and monitoring keywords and relevant hashtags extremely well so that ultimately, they can find and respond to more customers. Nike actually takes this one step further, and with over 4 million followers on Twitter, they've created a separate Twitter account specifically intended to responding to customer inquiries and issues (@NikeSupport). They've created a well-oiled customer service machine by responding to requests every few minutes. And by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">following this type of strategy</a>, Nike customers feel their concerns are being validated while they're receiving the timely customer assistance they require. Happy customers build brand ambassadors, and brand ambassadors generate recurring revenue.

Sidebar: we know what you're thinking...""Nike is a multi-billion dollar company with the resources to support that type of strategy."" Indeed they are, but the premise is still the same and equally important for your brand, no matter how large or small. Remember that consistency is key over quantity, so maybe you dedicate one or two days a week where you respond to all customer service inquiries and let your customers know when that day is. Practice makes perfect.
<h2>Create plenty of ways for people to interact with all of your channels:</h2>
The ultimate goal for any restaurant owner is to grow and maintain recurring traffic as it comes through the restaurant. Therefore, some of your posts should incorporate a call to action of some kind to inspire interaction from your viewers. Like, maybe you direct users to check out your site to receive information on special menu items only available to those who click through a specific link. Consequently, your website should also provide easy access to your different social media platforms while incorporating <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO techniques</a> to attract customers who are searching for certain keywords and topics about restaurants. Other strategies, like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email newsletters</a>, could include unique and relevant info that they can't receive through other social media platforms. You get the gist, provide opportunities for people to interact with your brand in unique ways.
<h2>Invite collaboration:</h2>
User-generated content is the social gods' gift to the digital universe. Rather than having your team constantly create unique content for all of your channels, effective social media marketing also incorporates repurposing user-generated content. You can encourage customers to share their experiences with you via a specific hashtag, invite your customers to check-in to your restaurant to receive something in return, run contests and repurpose photos or video - the possibilities are endless.

There you have it. With <a href=""http://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"">77% of B-to-C marketers acquiring customers through Facebook</a>, and over 90% of Twitter users reporting that they follow brands to receive special promos and discounts, a strong social media marketing strategy will continue to be vital for the success of restaurants within this competitive landscape.

3 ways to use social listening to increase customer service,"We recently posted an article about how brands like Jet Blue, Nike, Air Asia, Starbucks, and Whole Foods <strong>rock</strong> customer service on social media. “We’ll get right back to you in the next 48 hours” just is not going to cut it anymore. Welcome to the age of social listening, where a company’s communication/marketing staff must not only stay abreast of what’s happening to their product or service in general, but what specific individuals are saying about it online. We mentioned before that social listening is an art and a science, and requires some digging, from finding references on personal sites and blogs to engaging customers directly and quickly on prominent social networks.

Adding to the pressure is that there’s often an audience waiting to see how you respond to customer service issues on social. When someone posts a question or gripe on your company’s public Facebook page, anyone who sees that page can see how fast (and well - or not well) you answer.

In the end, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">good social listening comes down to great customer service</a>. Here are some examples of solid social listening:
<h2>Use social listening to show that you’re responsive and want to help.</h2>
Whether your customers are posting kudos or complaints, this provides an opportunity to demonstrate that a real human is responding behind the brand. You probably should refrain from getting into emotional discussions (because we know, you can't please <em>everybody</em>) and should also be ready to keep conversations from degrading into the sharing of all past grievances, especially on a public forum. However, you can at least hear people out and try to find a satisfactory solution. If a conversation starts going sideways, you can always encourage them to continue it by switching to email, text or phone. This puts it out of the public view and provides personal attention. We wrote before about <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/makers-mark-turns-whiskey-fail-into-win-2013-2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Maker’s Mark whiskey</a> and how they responded to their readers after showing major concern on social media regarding Maker's Mark's decision to reduce their alcohol content in its whiskey. The company actively engaged their audience during this quick turmoil period for the brand and ultimately reversed course.
<h2>Offer a different perspective.</h2>
Social listening isn’t just about responding to other peoples' posts on social media, but it's also about actively looking for places where your business is discussed and focusing on reputation management -we find a lot of these types of opportunities happening on public review sites like Yelp. <a href=""http://www.reviewtrackers.com/case-studies-business-owners-respond-bad-yelp-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Samovar teahouse in San Francisco</a> did an awesome job at responding to an unhappy customer via Yelp. They took responsibility for how the customer felt, validated her points of view and provided an opportunity to own responsibility own thoughts on the situation at hand.
<h2>Gain new customers.</h2>
<a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/8-ways-to-use-social-listening-for-your-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Zoe Summers from Social Media Examiner</a> suggests that the ability to demonstrate superior customer service could be seen as an asset to those who receive help and have their problem validated. She also suggests using SEO techniques to search keywords for any discussion or references to your business. Also, she and others suggest that you <a href=""http://www.business2community.com/social-business/7-ways-to-use-social-listening-being-the-james-bond-of-ecommerce-01365704"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">search for references to your products</a> and your competitors. If people are dissatisfied and grumbling about what Brand X offers, it can be an easy opportunity for you to join the discussion and let people know about your comparable product and how you can help<a href=""https://econsultancy.com/blog/64779-how-klm-nails-social-customer-care/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">. KLM, an international airline</a>, is often praised for “getting it right” as far as responding quickly, being honest, monitoring several channels and generally boosting its reputation.

"""Hello from the other side:"" Social listening effects","In 2013, Maker’s Mark made a decision that lead to a very serious problem - they reduced the amount of alcohol in their whiskey, a move that likely made sense on paper or in the boardroom. Not surprisingly, once word began to emerge, imbibers everywhere expressed outrage and after thousands of social media complaints and organized petitions, the company <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">utilized social listening data</a> and reversed course within a few days.

The company’s <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/makers-mark-turns-whiskey-fail-into-win-2013-2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">response</a> actually turned what could have been complete brand suicide into a social media win, and a positive experience. Not so much because they gave in fast to angry shouting, or even took action in the first place with little <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a>. It was more about listening to their current and potential customers, apologizing, trying to make things right and continuing forward with a strong relationship.

It was also a perfect example of something we call social listening. True social listening is when you take extra effort to discover what people are saying about your brand online. This could found in comments or questions on very public forums like social media platforms, positive or negative feedback on review sites, or even opinions on personal blogs.

Social listening blends fundamental customer service skills with digital marketing efforts. And businesses can go beyond their own social media and digital presence and utilize other methods, like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO techniques</a>, to track discussions and references, either getting involved in conversations - or at least observing what people have to say.

Here’s why it makes sense.
<h2>Easy market research</h2>
With social listening and social listening tools, you’ll have <a href=""https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2356681/how-to-optimize-your-content-strategy-with-social-listening"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more specific and thorough data</a> about who is using your products or services and what they genuinely think about them. Just because your CMO decides that a particular strategy is a solid one, doesn't mean your customers will buy into it. This can of course be a positive experience, as well as a negative one - as in the case with Maker's Mark. A great company can learn from both types of feedback. If you partner with an agency to engage in social listening, you’ll be guided through data like: where your customers are coming from and how important your product is in their lives. You can take this feedback and <a href=""http://www.business2community.com/social-media/a-guide-to-social-listening-for-improving-your-marketing-strategy-01349350#iv6Jz64dvc0wFupx.97"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">shape future projects and even online content</a>.
<h2>Real-time results</h2>
Before the digital marketing age, most companies had strict business hours and any customers who tried to contact them after these times were told to come back another day. Today, customers have the possibility to come from any time zone, anywhere around the world and provide feedback at anytime. By saying “we’re closed” may be frustrating or set a perception that you simply just don’t care. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">smart strategy</a> would be to put processes in place in order to provide customer assistance around the clock. For instance, <a href=""https://econsultancy.com/blog/64779-how-klm-nails-social-customer-care/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the airline KLM</a> has customer service staff that focus on email and phone support, plus 130 full-time social customer care employees who are strictly on social media. These types of efforts are responsible for an impressive 23-minute response time.
<h2>Discover and follow the influencers</h2>
If you listen hard enough, oftentimes there are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">super-users or prominent influencers</a> who are using your product and talking about it positively to their respective audiences – even without you requesting or paying them. This type of authentic, extra exposure can get more people to experience your product than you ever thought imaginable, especially with a positive endorsement. If they already like your product, they might be willing to talk to you about your other products or spread the word about what’s new. Today's consumers, specifically millennials, actively go out of their way to engage with brands highlighted by prominent <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">social media influencers</a>.
<h2>Better retention</h2>
<a href=""http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2013-social-media-benchmark-study"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">A J.D. Powers study</a> of 23,000 people in 2013 showed 67% contacted a business through social media for service needs. Related to this interest is a 2012 study from Gartner, which urged companies <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2101515"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">not to ignore social media</a> comments, questions or complaints. Ignoring someone is as bad as not answering the phone or an email, and can lead to a 15 % increase in churn.  The study’s conclusion warned companies to put mechanisms in place to accommodate what they anticipated would be a high rate of people interacting through social channel. So yep, you guessed it, listen to your audience on social and respond to them with an authentic brand voice.

5 digital marketing tools to help your small businesses succeed,"Choosing the right digital marketing tools can feel incredibly overwhelming as a small business owner. HOW do you navigate this ever-changing web landscape on your own? Do you absolutely need to hire a full-time digital marketing specialist? What about a marketing agency? The good news is - there is no wrong answer, and there are a ton of resources at your disposal. To help you determine the best strategy, these are our top five recommended tools to jumpstart your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">digital marketing strategy</a>. You can choose to leverage these on your own. Alternatively, you can partner with an agency to grow bigger, faster.
<h2>Google analytics:</h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">Google analytics</a> is a simple, effective tool to help you track your online traffic, discover trends, and pinpoint behavioral patterns. It's fairly user friendly after a few online tutorials, so don't be afraid to dig in and try this one on your own. It's especially important to feel comfortable reading and gathering data as a small business owner so you can digest and validate any information regarding the health of your business. If you only dedicate time to learning one digital marketing skill this year, Google Analytics gets our vote.
<h2>GoToWebinar:</h2>
Increase your reach and get the word out by using GoToWebinar. This platform allows you to broadcast sales calls, product and service releases, announcements, and speeches to hundreds of people at once. It encourages viral integration, so it will help generate buzz for your business. If you're comfortable speaking in public and want to unleash your creative side, GoToWebinar is a straightforward, powerful platform. However, crafting webinars that will generate leads and reel in ROI can be time consuming, so this is a good opportunity to partner with an agency or take a hybrid approach (i.e., an agency creates the content, you present it) if your team is too small for this type of indirect marketing.
<h2>SEO support:</h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO support</a> is probably the best place to splurge and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">hire a digital marketing agency</a>. SEO rankings are one-part science and one-part art. High rankings require blending <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a>, tagging, and back-linking to boost your search engine results. If you are already tech savvy, the actual work isn't as difficult as you think; but if the thought of a meta tag makes you want to break out in hives, it's best to leave this critical piece of the puzzle to the pros. A strong <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> will guide you in choosing the right keywords to target, help you craft content that will rank around those terms, and ensure your site is optimized for search engine crawlers.
<h2>HootSuite:</h2>
It's common knowledge that social media is a key to engaging with your audience. Use a tool like HootSuite to schedule your posts in advance and aggregate multiple social accounts and platforms into one easy-to-access place. HootSuite is easy to set up and use, so this is another great place to begin playing in the online space on your own. Not only can you use this platform to schedule posts weeks in advance on multiple channels, but you can also respond to feedback about your brand. This gives you a great opportunity to showcase your true, authentic brand voice.
<h2>WordPress:</h2>
Building a blog on WordPress takes the power of social media one step farther. Well written blogs can significantly boost SEO, drive traffic to your site and build credibility in your industry. Plus, WordPress is an incredibly easy platform to build your blog on. If you like writing, blogging can be a fun and cathartic way to express your professional passions. However, hiring a content marketing agency to work with you on blog topics or keywords will ensure your blog gets the most mileage and supports your SEO needs at the same time.

With these five tools, you're practically a digital marketing pro already. So what are you waiting for? Start exploring!

Consider these 3 things if you are marketing a bank,"Banks are oftentimes considered safe, reliable, and generally uninteresting – which is exactly the type of image the bank marketing industry has embraced for decades.

After all, would you feel more secure placing your money in the hands of an institutional-looking, serious company or a bright, colorful place that may even seem, dare we say it, fun?

The answer may surprise you: it’s both. It all depends on your age. Those who are 30 and older prefer the “classic banking” feel, where everyone is formal and official. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/shamahyder/2015/02/25/millennials-and-money-how-banks-are-missing-the-mark/#7d5dc56c788a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Millennials</a>, the 30 and under group (an ever-growing demographic), don’t have the same appreciation for the classics. If they go into a branch at all, since most of them prefer electronic banking, they prefer a place where employees are cheerful, casual and explain things to them in ways that aren’t painstakingly boring. Millennials are also more familiar with alternatives to traditional banking like crowd-sourcing or even digital wallets at online merchants.

So banks, or marketing agencies that represent banks, trying to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">create strategies</a> to draw in new customers and retain existing ones should consider finding ways to offer something for everyone – even if different generations seek different banking experiences.
<h2>Offer more audience specific products</h2>
This seems like a no-brainer, but with financial institutions now providing more than basic banking and majority of branches offering financial services, investment advising, insurance, currency exchanges or business services, it's imperative for banks to find unique ways to explain these options to potential customers. We all know that casting a wide net and hoping a general audience buys into what you're selling is not realistic in today's digital space. So, tightly <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">defining who your audience is</a> and why they would specifically be interested in the product is key for banks as millennials start driving the majority of their audience base.
<h2>Offer mobile products and make them secure</h2>
More and more of our business is being done via our mobile devices with users finding it convenient to do things that used to require a phone call or a branch visit. Through their apps or responsively-designed sites, banks can now allow customers to check balances, transfer money, scan checks, deposit money electronically, and make payments.  The number of users for mobile banking is high and expected to increase, according to the Federal Reserve’s <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201503.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">“Consumer and Mobile Services” report</a> in 2015. Something to note is why some aren’t interested in switching: convenience and perceived lack of benefits (habit) are at the top, followed by security concerns.
<h2>Explore new bank marketing channels while remembering your roots</h2>
<a href=""http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/banks-have-a-case-of-digital-marketing-myopia-1069160-1.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Kevin Tynan at American Banker</a> warned his peers not to get too carried away with trying too many “new and different” things. His concern is that banks will start to lose sight of their core commitments to customers if they start over-experimenting. He actually argues some good points about the true strength of a bank being its employees and their relationship with their customers. However, one could argue that with such a large majority of customers utilizing mobile banking and hardly ever stepping into a branch, maybe this point of view is outdated. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">great marketing agency</a> for banks can actually enhance this connection with digital products. This can be done through a strong social media presence, an SEO-focused site, text messaging, online ads, email newsletters or other fresh ways of interacting. Even a fun YouTube video describing products or basic financial strategies could be useful, and can be watched anywhere, anytime.

The merging of digital and traditional marketing tactics,"The infamous Don Draper didn’t do anything with digital advertisements, and he sure did pretty well, didn’t he?

Sure - the setting of “Mad Men” took place decades before terms like: banner ads, click-thrus, CPM, and all those other important digital marketing-speak buzzwords became normal parts of our vocabulary. And fictitious characters like Don Draper, much like the rest of his Madison Avenue cronies, pulled all sorts of shenanigans that could get someone slapped, if not fired (or arrested) today.

But the world of Sterling Cooper, at least professionally, showed us an ideal <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">advertising agency</a>, including some creative account management strategies and marketing practices that can still be emulated today.

Unfortunately, one of the elements of the old-school approach still used by modern ad agencies is when clients are sometimes offered separate menus for “traditional” off-line services, as well as for their digital marketing needs. In some cases, an agency may even have specific account execs who focus solely on offering their expertise in one discipline or another.

Each approach has its advantages – digital is growing, and has a far greater reach than local media. And, of course, it is easier to track. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">Traditional media</a>, however, still finds support among consumers and is almost expected in certain campaign strategies (print, billboards, direct mail, etc.), while some traditional advertisements commanding a higher price point than their electronic counterparts.

What's happening in today’s world is that both of these approaches are merging together, so instead of presenting distinctions to clients between your digital marketing agency service offerings and your advertising agency service offerings, clients are often told “we can do it all."" Talk about “simple but significant” (a classic Draper line).

Here’s why it’s a smart strategy.
<h2>It shows that you can in fact - do it all</h2>
If your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> partner is able to offer “everything,” rather than one approach or the other, they’ll focus on the client first and how best to help them. If a client wants to change their spending in one area, the same person or the same team can say “let’s figure out how to make it happen” instead of “let me hand you off to other people who know more about that.”
<h2>Less internal competition</h2>
If you have some team members who are knowledgeable in digital and/or non-digital programs, they likely will push for their particular products and skill sets, even if unintentional. Digital and non-digital proponents, along with a finite amount of a client's budget, can lead to sometimes strong internal discussions about which direction to go. Each program has its merits, but a client might feel pressured or confused when the digital specialist has different recommendations than the non-digital rep.
<h2>The digital marketing landscape has changed</h2>
Not long ago, digital consumers used different tools and resources to reach their audiences. Social media, desktops, live streaming, and mobile phones all required distinct strategies. But now, with <a href=""http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more people using mobile devices</a> instead of desktops, consumers can do it all with only one device. From an advertising agency perspective, mobile and non-mobile should replace digital and non-digital.
<h2>Not everyone likes digital marketing</h2>
Whether out of unfamiliarity, habit, general dislike or just stubbornness, some people prefer non-digital methods like newspapers or direct mail. It’s likely this number will decline over the years as it becomes increasingly difficult to resist technology. But smart advertising agencies should be able to advise their clients that there’s a time for every method, even non-digital. <a href=""http://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/5-times-to-use-snail-mail-not-email.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Inc tells us</a> that snail mail, as much as it's ridiculed by tech enthusiasts, can sometimes have a more precise reach than email. A personalized note can also go a long way in today's virtual society, rather than the same email that everyone on a list receives.
<h2>More data to drive customers to make decisions</h2>
With digital advertising, a business can have all sorts of metrics available to them they never did before. Business owners can also use these outlets to tell their customers about their off-line products. With a social media post like, “check out some photos from our new magazine campaign” or “we just put up a cool new billboard on the highway. Check it out!” The opposite can be true too – the off-line products should drive people to the site to learn more info.
<h2>Clients want both traditional and digital marketing</h2>
In a study published in <a href=""http://oursocialtimes.com/how-to-combine-traditional-and-digital-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">OurSocialTimes</a>, it describes the predicted spike in digital marketing in that 77% of surveyed companies plan to increase their digital marketing budgets. But at the same time, a small percentage of those surveyed said that 80% of their marketing output comes from lower-tech efforts such as trade shows, sales calls, and opportunities to have a face-to-face conversation. It’s essentially Sales 101, only now, the sales executive has more tools at their disposal to help build a company’s brand.

The top 4 Facebook marketing do's and don'ts you should know,"We're gettin' down to the nitty gritty of 4 Facebook Marketing Do's and Don'ts, an article published from our very own Vice President of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Strategy and Insight</a> . Soak it up people!

<em>Originally published February 22, 2016 on BrandBlab.</em>
<h2><strong>The Facebook marketing do’s</strong></h2>
<strong><span class=""underline"">1. Visual content reigns</span> –</strong> Start with relevant and compelling videos or high-quality images first in order to tell the story and support it with minimal copy. Utilize the new photo/<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video posting</a> options by sharing multiple videos, photo album, photo carousel, or create a slideshow.

<span class=""underline""><strong>2. Be social</strong></span> – Seems obvious but socializing requires consideration and an openness to enter into a two-way dialogue with someone. Broadcasting and publishing content is a one-way monologue and doesn’t forge friendships. Take interest in what others are posting on and off your page and engage with them. Also tag those who are significant to the nature of your posts.

<strong><span class=""underline"">3. Spell check is your friend</span></strong> – Don’t ruin great content and social dialogue with typos and grammatical errors. Always run spell check and carefully proof every word and punctuation before you hit enter. Your digital language is representative of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand’s personality</a>.

<strong><span class=""underline"">4. Targeting</span></strong> – With the decline in Facebook page reach, post targeting is a feature that can get posts to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">the right audience</a>. You can ensure that your posts are connecting with a specific demo with relatable interests. A minimum of 20 people must be in the target group.
<h2><strong>The Facebook marketing don’ts</strong></h2>
<strong><span class=""underline"">1. #TooManyHashtags</span></strong> – Hashtags are not as actively used as they are on Twitter and Instagram. However, be sure not to flood your copy with hashtags and definitely avoid making up random non-trending hashtags as substitutes for phrases in your sentence.

<strong><span class=""underline"">2. The commercial</span> </strong>– Organic content on Facebook should not be salesy or promotional in nature. That’s like going to a friend’s house party and instead of socializing, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">trying to sell merchandise</a> out of a suitcase to the guests. Use Facebook Ads to strategically advertise your wares to the right audience seeking what you have to offer and leave your organic content to nurturing sincere relationships with your audience.

<strong><span class=""underline"">3. The short story</span> </strong>– Do not write a paragraph worth of copy unless you want to ensure that no one read it. While Generation X and Baby Boomers are the growing demos on Facebook, their attention spans are not much greater than that of the younger generations. Keep it concise and limited to a sentence or two if at all possible.

<strong><span class=""underline"">4. Barking orders</span></strong> – There is absolutely no need to tell your audience to “click here for more,” “watch this video,” or “like this.” They will do everything you want them to do and more if you are compelling, relevant, and engaging with your content. After all, you should desire real fans and not those that feel obligated to follow your demands.",,3/3/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/social-media-4.jpg,the-top-4-facebook-marketing-dos-and-donts,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Stunning renditions of the Game of Thrones cover art,"At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we pride ourselves on the opportunity to promote personal development and growth through curiosity. In particular, we love to give our creatives around here a lot of wiggle room when working with us. For that reason, whenever we have graphic design interns, we encourage them to take on a semester project, in addition to all of the awesome client work they get to dig their teeth in to. The semester project allows for interns to express themselves through a visual medium of choice. They’re asked to reinterpret something known to pop or local culture in a way that speaks to their creative abilities. Through mentorship with our awesome Creative Director and other members of the design team, they learn to shape and sharpen their creative approach. After about a few months and plenty of hard work - BAM! We get superb renderings of staples in popular culture.

Last semester a particularly savvy intern, Candace Hoeckley, decided to take on a redesign of the <i> Game of Thrones</i> book cover series. Unless you’ve been living in a yurt or have recently awoken from a decade-long coma, you’re probably familiar with the multi-million dollar franchise. George R. R. Martin’s five (soon to be six) book storyline chronicles the fictitious contention amongst the houses of Westeros for the Iron Throne. Hence the namesake <em>Game of Thrones</em>.

Simplistic, intelligent design intermingled with the element of gore in this recreation of the book covers, each one reflects the content and title of every installment. The common themes of blood and snow are called upon to represent the forthcoming storyline. As many Game of Thrones fans know, the fight for the kingdom of Westeros is a cold, bloody one. As you go through each image, you will see the sparse grass disappearing under the cover of snow. This parallels the storyline’s dark, growing ominous character and the longstanding civil war.

The newly envisioned covers serve as an incredible testament to George R. R. Martin’s genius and that of our stellar intern. And, if you think can’t get enough  - trust us, we feel the same way. We’ll all just have to wait for that last two installments to round out the entire series.

Wagner dos Santos Assumes New Role As VP of Strategy and Insights,"<strong>BIGEYE’S WÁGNER DOS SANTOS ASSUMES NEW ROLE AS VICE PRESIDENT OF STRATEGY AND INSIGHTS</strong>

<strong>Orlando, Florida</strong> <strong>– February 29th, 2016 –</strong> <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">BIGEYE</a>, a fully integrated advertising and marketing agency headquartered in Orlando’s Audubon Park announced today that Wágner dos Santos will assume a new role as Vice President of Strategy and Insights. Dos Santos initially joined the agency as Senior Director of Marketing and Strategic Planning in December 2013, and since that time, the agency has experienced rapid growth. As a result of this expansion, in mid-January 2016, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> released news of its relocation to a new workspace, tripling the size of the company’s former location. With a burgeoning portfolio and long-term focus on expanding its reach by serving clients in varying industries, the agency has solidified its dedication to providing enhanced strategic insight and direction to clients in conjunction with a number of planned initiatives over the next four years.

Dos Santos is an industry veteran with a career spanning more than twenty years. He is a seasoned brand strategist, experiential and social marketer, and esteemed public speaker. Prior to joining <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, he served as President/CEO and founder of Beloved, a national award-winning marketing agency. Throughout the course of his career, he honed his craft by collaborating with international brands such as Coca-Cola, Google, Dell, Target, Ford, Sprint, Autograph Collection Hotels, and Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts, among many others. He has also gleaned invaluable expertise through his past positions with Sony Masterworks and agency powerhouses Momentum Worldwide (Interpublic Group), GMR Marketing (Omnicom), and Havas Impact.

In 2010, dos Santos was recognized as a “Most Influential Businessmen” nominee by the <em>Orlando Business Journal</em>. He is also a trustee and former president of the American Advertising Federation-Orlando.

“Our growth as an agency is, in part, attributable to Wagner’s leadership throughout his tenure with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, and his new role in spearheading our strategy and insights team presents the ideal opportunity to further our standing as an industry leader in Florida, as well as the southeast,” said <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>’s CEO and Principal, Justin Ramb. “Wagner’s extensive expertise and unique strategic vision proves to be an invaluable resource for our clients,” Ramb commented.

Now that you've met Sir Wagner, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/agency/team/"">meet</a> the rest of our creative renegades.",,3/1/2016 12:15,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Wagner.jpg,bigeyes-wagner-dos-santos-assumes-new-role-as-vice-president-of-strategy-and-insights,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
The top digital marketing trends for 2016 that you need to know,"With the first quarter of 2016 well underway, the biggest <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing trends</a> of the year are beginning to emerge. Don't wait while the competition tackles the biggest bets of the season: bring you - and your company - up to speed on this year's most critical digital marketing trends. Although many of the tried and true trends from years past are still making the cut, 2016 brings new breakthroughs in customization and data mining that take our top digital marketing trends to the next level.
<h2>Content marketing</h2>
Are you surprised to see this at the top of the list (again)? We weren't. The amount of money companies are willing to spend on content creation has been steadily increasing over the past five years. It's also ranked as having the highest predicted impact on commercial marketing in 2016 according to <a href=""http://www.smartinsights.com/tag/2016-digital-marketing-trends/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Smart Insights</a>. Whether you choose to create new content in-house or leverage a local Florida digital marketing agency like ours, it's important that all your content is crisp, clear, and speaks directly to your target audience. It's time to get painfully focused on your top customers - the rest will follow in a halo effect of unbeatable brand value.
<h2>Mobile marketing</h2>
Census studies show that more than <a href=""https://www.cmocouncil.org/facts-stats-categories.php?view=all&amp;category=mobile-marketing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">60% of consumers are willing to make a major purchase on a mobile device</a>. In years past, the hurdle was getting customers to purchase big ticket items online. Now, we've reached a pivotal point where people are not only willing to purchase online, but they're willing to do it from their mobile phones. This means businesses must invest in responsive websites, mobile friendly e-commerce platforms, and streamlined trial and purchase flows. If your website is still stuck in 1999, the quickest (and most effective) way to bring your site up to speed is to work in partnership with a digital marketing agency. Due to the importance of good user interface and information architecture, we don't recommend beginners go the DIY route. Splurge here and prepare for the future with a clean, easy-to-use mobile-ready site.
<h2>SEO enhancements</h2>
As competition heats up, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> will become even more critical as a competitive advantage. Google has (<em>again</em>) changed their search results pages sending many search marketers into a flurry of activity. Earlier this month, Google removed text ads from the right rail of their search results and will now show four <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid ads</a> before users see organic search results (with a maximum of four ads per search query). That means showing up in that number-one organic search slot is even more important than EVER if you hope to compete with paid advertisers. Understanding how internal linking, tagging, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> play a part in search rankings is a great place to start. Simple but effective enhancements can easily be done on your own, so we recommend starting there and then partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> if you need a little extra fire power.
<h2>Personalized marketing</h2>
Personalized marketing has the power to disarm prospects and add new value to your existing (and hopefully repeating) customer base. Receiving <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">personalized emails</a>, custom product recommendations, or promotions and offers based on behavioral triggers are one of the most powerful ways to engage your audience. It's no secret that people like feeling as if you're talking directly to them or tailoring an experience to their needs. Even though yes, we admit, it's kinda creepy. However! This speaks to the fundamental marketing psychology principle that people are more likely to convert if the experience has greater perceived value to them - and the best way to boost someone's perceived value is to speak to them (rather than at them) and anticipate their needs. Using data to look for trends in your customer base and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">creating a marketing plan</a> around these behaviors is one way to do it. Layering in ""right for me"" product selectors, quizzes, or bundles is another easy way to get close.
<h2>Leveraging big data</h2>
Knowledge is power. Which is why big data is such a powerful tool. While the data itself isn't a trend per se, using it to craft better <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">website content</a> and create meaningful digital marketing experiences is. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Partnering with a digital marketing agency</a> or third party data management tool can give you the detailed insight into your customers that you crave and need to succeed. The sheer volume of information we have about our customers and people like them is staggering - the trick is using it to make a best-in-class marketing experience. Digital specialists are best positioned to achieve this goal and help you understand the levers you need to pull to enhance your customer experience.
<h2>Retargeting</h2>
Retargeting is the marriage between personalized marketing and big data. Dropping cookies onto your customer experience to both track trends and serve them content based on what they were previously looking for is invaluable and one of the biggest conversion drivers to combat cart abandonment or close large scale purchases. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">Retargeting</a> allows you to remind your prospects why they want to move forward in the purchase experience or show them new products and experiences your brand has to offer. Amazon owns this experience.

Top five things to consider when rebranding your business,"If anybody knows that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">rebranding</a> is a huge undertaking – it’s us. Before you get to the best part (new colors, logos, web design, and all the exciting creative pieces in between), it’s important that your rebranding initiative is grounded in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">strong strategy</a>. When fleshing out your process for rebranding, here are our top 5 things to consider:
<h2><strong>1. Assessing your existing brand value:</strong></h2>
Even if it’s time for a change, chances are your existing brand still holds some power. To help guide your rebranding strategy, take a step back and look at what’s being said about the company in the media, online, and in blogs. The existing conversation will help you understand your current brand value and make decisions about how much of that brand you want to keep and how much you want to refresh. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/branding-strategy-tips-that-make-an-awesome-impression"">branding</a> agency can also help you aggregate and assess this information — which is especially important if you want to put a monetary value around your old company assets or are considering going public in the near future. This assessment will help you understand what worked, what didn’t, and what elements of your current brand you want to protect.
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2. Get to the “why” of rebranding:</span></h2>
What customer or market insights are driving this change? If you are rebranding due to a string of bad press, your strategic approach should be radically different than if you are rebranding because you are acquiring new, exciting assets. If these changes are sensitive in nature, partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/branding-strategy-tips-that-make-an-awesome-impression"">branding</a> agency may be your best bet to understand how to reach out to the market and drive positive results. If you’re simply adapting to a changing customer demographic, you may have it slightly easier but still need to get ruthlessly specific with your internal team about what’s motivating this change so they can get fired up behind the company’s new goals. This “why” will serve as a compass for all future decisions, employee questions, and forks in the road. If in doubt during the rebranding experience, simply ask yourself how that choice ladders up to your “why.”
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. Defining what makes your rebranding different:</span></h2>
One of the most important steps in the process for rebranding a company is identifying competitive differentiators. What makes you, you? In many ways, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">rebranding</a> a company is very similar to starting a new company or beginning a fresh entrepreneurial project. Your audience will need to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">understand your unique value proposition</a>, what sets you apart from your competitor, and how you’re making your customers’ lives better. If you’re rebranding, you’ve probably already begun to anticipate a new customer need that they may not even realize yet, so don’t fall prey to the temptation of being a generalist. Sing those differentiators loud and proud and get specific about what customer needs you’re satisfying. In short, rebranding is a lot more than just a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">new name</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo</a>. It fundamentally captures something new you hope to bring to the market – and getting clear on what that “something” is will help catapult the project to success.
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">4. Establish what success looks like:</span></h2>
Speaking of success, you need to understand what that looks like for your company. Is it an increase in sales? A new customer base? A bigger share of the competitive wallet? Before you begin a rebranding project, determine how much time, money, energy, and resources you’re willing to allocate to the initiative and what you expect in return. Having clear milestones and measurable goals will level set expectations and set the new brand up for success. This also serves as a system of checks and balances to ensure you are on track with your targeted process for rebranding a company.
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">5. Executing your rebranding strategy:</span></h2>
After all of that’s finished, it’s time to execute your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">rebranding strategy</a>. That includes communicating to existing customers about the brand change and capturing the attention of new customers who are about to discover your organization. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">branding agency</a> is the quickest and most effective way to understand how to talk to these two very distinct audiences and what tools will be most beneficial in driving change. While you’re promoting the new <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand identity</a>, you also need to be reeducating existing clients about why the change occurred and how they still fit into your company ecosystem. This is a delicate – but important – balance.

You’ll notice that we intentionally left out detailing the creative development stages from our rebranding check list. That isn’t to say that we don’t think this step is important (after all, you can’t rebrand without those elements), but rather that it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new creative or packaging and lose sight of the strategic insight driving your changes. A rebrand is the perfect time to hit the pause button on your business and make meaningful, lasting change that you can’t do when you’re wholly focused on the day-to-day.

Effectively manage customer relationships in marketing channels,"We know we've been harpin' on this for a while, but although your customers may be the same across all channels, how you communicate with them across these channels is not a one size fits all model. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">Deep customer insights</a> start with understanding your customer relationships inside and out. Strong customer relationships mean that you not only understand the product features that influence their decision making process, but that you also understand how they like to communicate, what information they need, as well as when and where they need it. To help you understand the nuances and importance of this distinction, we've broken out the top customer channels and the important distinctions between each.
<h2>Web:</h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">Your website is the face of your company</a>. It's your biggest and best opportunity to showcase your brand's personality, expand on your value proposition, and capture the heart and attention of your customer base. You can include as many product and service descriptions as you like, snapshots of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand values</a>, and a deep dive into your mission statement and authenticity as a company. Understanding why customers are coming to your website and what they're looking for is key. Spend time digging into the information architecture of your site (a.k.a. what information is shown when and where), and deeply consider the user experience by looking at other industry leaders. If you need creative support or strategic insight, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> can definitely help. This is arguably the single most important aspect of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">branding strategy</a> in today's digitally-driven world, so it's a good place to splurge (or start).
<h2>Social:</h2>
Unlike your website, which presents static information outward to your consumer, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> is an opportunity for you to have ongoing customer relationships. You can directly answer their questions, address customer service issues, and understand their feelings about your brand. This channel is important because interaction tends to be more casual, more personal, and more tailored on an individual level. Social media helps you strengthen existing relationships and create brand advocates who will recommend your company or share their experiences in the digital marketing ecosystem. Customer relationships through your social media channels are likely farther down on the conversion funnel than first time visitors to your website, so your primary goal here should be to re-affirm your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand identity</a> and share culture related updates and additional industry relevant information. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content agency</a> can help bolster your posts to alleviate the time required managing this content in house. At the same time, you can also use social media as a real-time focus group to provide feedback on how you're doing, how to improve, and even soft launch ideas or products.
<h2>Media:</h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">Paid traditional media</a> is a unique and quickly evolving channel. In previous years, it was used as the marketing bread and butter for everyone from the sole proprietor to the advertising agency, today, it works as a very top-of-funnel experience to drive general <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">awareness about your brand</a>. Paid media doesn't hold the same authority it once did (because customers are more likely to trust social media or peer reviews than an ad in a magazine), so treat it as an introduction for your customers rather than a pure closing mechanism. Tease the brand values. Peak your customers' interest. Media is a gateway that directs customers to your website or sales funnel, so understanding this distinction will help you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">target your messaging</a> accordingly and provide proof that backs up your brand statements.
<h2>Mobile:</h2>
It's easy to mix your mobile prospects in with your desktop website users, but the reality is that people searching your site on their mobile devices and tablets are likely at a different stage in the customer lifecycle and purchase journey. Mobile users are most likely looking for quick, high-level information <em>(because let's be serious, they're either sitting at a red light or passively doing something else while also looking at your site)</em>. Very often, they are at the start of their purchase path and just beginning to get a feel for your company, so only the most crucial information from your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website should be presented</a>. However, mobile purchases are on the rise, and it is one of the fastest growing channels for conversion, so people may also be returning to the mobile site to complete their purchase after they've dug deep on the full desktop site or via <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a>. In this way, the mobile channel serves as bookends for your customer experience and should distill the most essential messages down to their essence.
<h2>Organic search:</h2>
Last, but certainly not least, organic search is an incredibly powerful tool to help manage your customer relationships. Understanding that customers coming in through this channel are likely very new and unsure of what they are looking for - is crucial. You must anticipate their needs by aligning your company to non-branded words that customers will search for and provide enough information so that they want to learn more. Prospects coming in through the organic search channel may benefit from a tailored landing page or web experience that formally addresses the search terms they used and the needs of that audience. Unlike your main marketing site, these customers are likely looking for something specific (even if they're unsure of what that solution looks like yet), so you want to make sure they know you can deliver.

While each channel is unique and different, they're all important for the overall customer journey and experience. It's tempting to say one is more important than the other, but knowing that potential customers often drift through many - if not all - channels before committing to a purchase will help you understand how this concert of information works together. Each channel is a key piece in the customer journey and an opportunity to show the heart of your brand.

"The future of SEO: It's Google's world, we're just living in it","Google's done it again - changed their <em>effing</em> SEO rules. If you were a digital marketer just three years ago, you'll likely remember the <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-pirate-update"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Google Pirate</a> released the first of many algorithm changes that impacted how web bots crawl, index, and rank every site on the web. Just as marketers were getting comfortable with Pirate, the <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hummingbird update hit</a>. And then there was the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Panda</a> and <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/miketempleman/2015/10/30/google-penguin-4-0-and-what-you-need-to-know/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Penguin</a> updates. Don't forget about the Pigeon update. And that's only to name a few. This February, Google launched a unique (but happily less disruptive) update targeting how they treat AdWords paid displays within search results. Despite its seemingly innocuous impact, this small update may have a huge influence on the future of search engine optimization. Here's the low down:
<h2>What changed:</h2>
Google changed their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid advertising display</a> on desktop search results to remove right-rail advertisements completely and only allow for four paid search results to populate before organic rankings take over. This may seem like a relatively small change (and a good one for the customer and small business owner who doesn't have a massive media budget), but the impact is critical. This update dramatically decreases the clutter people see when searching and allows customers to focus on the top earned - rather than paid - results. It goes without saying that this limits the amount of skew that occurs from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid advertisers</a>. We know it's great when you have excess marketing budget, but the internet - and search engine optimization - has never been about the pay-to-play model. That's why this update helps keep search results pure. But, that also means your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> game needs to be on point.

If you're in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">PPC</a> (pay-per-click) business, your life just got a lot more difficult. If you're in the SEO game, now's the time to make your mark.
<h2>What does that mean for SEO?</h2>
Reducing the amount of ads and streamlining the results means that securing a top organic search ranking is even more important than ever. All eyes will now be laser focused on a consolidated list of results, with more opportunity for organically ranked companies to appear above the fold. As a search marketer, front and center has always been important, but now there is more clean real estate in this space, which means competition is about to get fierce.

So, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Digital marketers who haven't invested as much time or energy into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> efforts (favoring the easier, direct PPC route) will have to start getting serious about their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search engine optimization strategy</a>. In a few months, many of these companies will have started diverting resources into their organic search campaigns. This means that companies who already have a strong search foundation should get ready to take their efforts to the next level. While other companies scramble to catch up, savvy SEO marketers will have begun optimizing their sites even further in an effort to get ahead of the curve.
<h2>How to get ahead:</h2>
At this point, you're probably asking yourself: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!

<strong>Content marketing:</strong> Take time to understand the keywords you want to focus on. Get specific and remember that being the number one spot with a critical few is better than falling just below the fold on 20 general terms. Once you've narrowed down your terms, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">start generating content</a>. Get the blog posts fired up, get your internal links ready to go, and refresh your site content. Just know that any changes you make today will take a few months to be indexed, so don't wait too long before moving.

<strong>Non-branded keyword landing pages:</strong> Another great way to bolster SEO ranking is to create landing pages that target non-branded keywords. Apply the same principle you did when narrowing down your content marketing keywords. Then, hone in on how to build mini-pages that can link back to your main site while promoting these niche words. The specificity will help boost your ranking on key phrases, while the tailored content will help drive user engagement as an added bonus. A win-win situation.

<strong>Spread the word:</strong> Now more than ever before, it's important that other websites are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">linking to your content</a>. Blog or write about topics relevant to your brand to help drive this inactive forward and then reach out to other industry influencers and tastemakers in hopes of getting an endorsement. Of course, it helps when you have something to exchange, so don't be afraid to spotlight partners on your site or via <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>.

The only things certain in life are death, taxes, and change ... so you should expect plenty more changes to how search engine optimization continues to evolve. Staying on top of the trends makes each subsequent update a little easier to digest than scrambling to catch up after three or four have passed. It's an investment that ensures your content is seen by the right audience and that the work you put into your website and brand is put to good use. After all, if no one can find your content, they won't be able to convert, and they'll never become your customers.

Why you need a content marketing agency (for real),"You're busy, you know it, your employees know it, your investors know it - errybody knows it. This is why you need a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">content marketing agency</a> (<em>for real</em>).
<h2>Rules change</h2>
When it comes to online content, everything is really defined as ‘best practices’ as opposed to hard-and-fast rules. And knowing the ins and outs of these practices, particularly which ones to follow or ignore, is pretty much a full-time job, especially since Google and <a href=""http://wallaroomedia.com/facebook-newsfeed-algorithm-change-history/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Facebook</a> keep changing their measurement methods for how businesses are being ranked and noticed. So even if you think you had these processes nailed a few years ago, you better bet those methods have already changed. And, if you're following all of the old ""rules,"" you could actually be penalizing your business in Google's eyes. This is probably the biggest reason why you need a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a>. It's ultimately our job to make sure we're up to date on all of this madness, and it's ultimately your job to keep your customers happy and your business running.
<h2>Avoiding future costs</h2>
Along with knowing how to ""do"" <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> properly, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> also knows how to navigate other digital minefields - like losing followers on your social media channels because you've over-posted ads to the wrong audiences. Content marketing agencies can also advise on what mistakes are actually making your lose money, a serious risk if you use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">automated email</a> or text messaging to connect with existing or potential customers but don’t have full authorization to contact them. Let's not even mention the additional costs that as a consumer you'll pay top dollar for, whereas a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">content marketing agency</a> will most likely be given insider pricing.
<h2>Reports out the wazoo</h2>
Let's just pretend that you love making sense of trackable data (<em>which we damn well know, you do not</em>), what are you supposed to do with all that data once you have it? CPC's, bounce rates, referral traffic, what does it all MEAN!? A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> can load you up with all kinds of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">analytic information</a> that's been analyzed and strategized. They can analyze your performance down to a finite detail, where visitors are coming from, where they're dropping off, how often they're staying, where they're clicking, etc. Also, if you're considering a large media spend on various digital channels, you're probably going to want to see which ad is performing better, and why - soon. So that you can pivot as quickly as possible to ensure all of your allocated budget is being invested successfully. Seriously, what's the point of investing high dollars if you don't care to know, don't know how to interpret, or don't want to know about - the ridiculous amount of reporting. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Let a content agency do that for you</a>.
<h2>Multi-channel knowledge</h2>
You may know Facebook well, your spouse might know Twitter well, and your kids, they probably know Snapchat or Instagram a little too well. A business trying to be successful in today’s digital world needs the ability to connect with many channels at once, while also offering a unique presence and message for each one. It’s a constant balancing act because not everyone on a channel is an active user. You want to go where the audiences are, like Facebook, but also don’t want to ignore those who aren’t active on that channel. A content marketing agency is not only familiar with all current <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media content</a> channels (as well as have their pulse on what's happening for the future), but know which ones are most important for driving YOUR customers to YOUR your business. Having a vast understanding of multi-channel knowledge is key to achieving an effective content marketing strategy, and seriously, you know you don't have time for that.

5 content ideas for insurance marketing that actually work,"We know, it's counter intuitive, but don’t be fooled by actuarial tables, lists of legalese and piles of ridiculous paperwork - because insurance marketing isn’t nearly as boring as you may think. Like <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldshelp/2011/08/12/is-insurance-boring/#7dd367c07e04"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a 2011 Forbes column by Ronald Shelp</a> pointed out, despite the stereotypical image of the industry as incredibly boring there are some pretty freakin' creative content marketing ideas out there you can use.

Since most insurance agencies offer extremely similar, basic products - a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">solid content marketing plan</a> can present an awesome opportunity to show consumers and potential customers what makes one individual agency worth considering.  And that, our friends, is where the creativity comes in.

Here are five content marketing ideas to help set your insurance company apart from the rest:
<h2>Experience</h2>
If you’re looking for a unique angle to demonstrate why customers should purchase a policy from you instead of your competitors, search for some positive time-related metrics that the competition may not have, like: maybe years of training? Certifications? Availability? Customers who have policies for an unusually long time? A greater number of local and national awards from different industry groups or local organizations? Thank-you letters from satisfied clients? Health and life insurance policies are currently the leading drivers for consumers, especially in the US market since the launch of the Affordable Care Act. So perhaps using your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> to emphasize your successful experience within these markets can set you apart from your competitors.

Here's an awesome example, Independence Blue Cross pretty much owned this concept for their Live Fearless Mantra TV commercial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCRXzIwbb8
<h2>Unusual policies</h2>
Every agency offers the bare bones - the basics: home, auto and life. But who's offering extra coverage for high-dollar/high-maintenance wine collections? Or rare baseball cards? Or an antique car that spends more time in the garage being pampered rather than actually firing that baby up. Certainly any agent can learn the basics of how to put a policy together, but someone who markets themselves as being “the knowledgeable choice” in certain subject areas or advertises in places where this audience frequents (collector/enthusiasts sites or specialty blogs) could get some serious attention from potential customers.
<h2>Better costs</h2>
Most insurance agents will pitch you this little gem, ""you’ll be happy that you paid more for extra coverage when disaster strikes."" However, we all want to be wise stewards of their money and will instinctively look for any easy opportunities to save. Some of the national insurance companies even make a point of emphasizing their affordability for basic coverage. While emphasizing the quality coverage and not offering something too drastic and bare-bones, agencies can promote their ability to offer different discounts like reductions for certain conditions – good student/good driver/safe driver/multiple policies. Also, try crafting this dry message in a way that everyone can contextualize. Just because your policy is a snooze-fest, doesn't mean your marketing message needs to equally as lame. Maybe position your message in a way that reads – “that's the cost of a two Starbucks lattes a week.”
<h2>Mention the scary stuff</h2>
We know it’s risky to ‘sell fear,’ and normally, that's certainly not our holistic approach. However, insurance agencies probably know more than anyone else how quickly a bad turn of events can happen, that’s part of their reality. However, they also know that they can serve as an aid to their policy-holders who wisely made choices to invest with them. So rather than your commercials being filled with frightening natural disasters, multi-car fender-benders, or burning buildings, the agent’s message could also focus more on their role – which should ultimately be to provide comfort in a disastrous time for their customers. In an industry that's overflowing with complaints and dissatisfied customers, sometimes a heartwarming, even light-hearted, loyalty-building approach might just be the way to go.

Side note: either Minnesotans are the coolest people in the country or they have the weirdest sense of humor, ever. MNsure does a great job of ""showing the scary stuff"" without providing a literal translation to that statement. In this video, they are essentially making their customers aware of the scary things that could happen while living in Minnesota. We think it's pretty genius.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSZn6X8JRVw
<h2>Emphasize the good stuff</h2>
At the end of the day, the essential reason for an insurance policy is peace of mind and general security. With proper planning, you and your family will ultimately be protected. Even if you avoid filing major claims, you’ll still be protected - and that’s worth celebrating. Testimonials from clients being thankful for their foresight in purchasing policies can be really powerfully promoted. Visual assets of clients enjoying their time doing pretty much anything else besides thinking at about fire, hurricanes, flooding (insert your long list of natural disasters here), health, life - could be a smart strategy.

New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange's TV ad for their ""accidental spokesman"" sums this up in a pretty clever way.

Why you need to know the 6 ways Google's RankBrain will impact SEO,"Because Google never likes to miss an opportunity to keep your favorite <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing/seo-search-engine-optimization"">SEO marketer</a> and <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing"">digital marketing agency</a> on their toes, they recently announced that close to 15% of their search queries is answered by a robust artificial intelligence (AI) called RankBrain. RankBrain's primary function is to more accurately sort through search requests - especially those that are difficult to interpret - and understand what and, more importantly, why people are searching. Cracking these questions allows the search giant to yield better, more focused results.

If you're thinking to yourself, ""Wait, what about the Hummingbird algorithm? I just got used to THAT update!"" ... Don't worry. The RankBrain AI is only responsible for tackling more complex queries that don't have clear SEO keyword mapping. The Hummingbird SEO ranking methodology is still very much in play, so no <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO company</a> is off the hook - or out of work just yet. That isn't to say that RankBrain won't have a significant impact on search engine marketing itself, it simply means the old rules still apply too. Here are our top six predictions on how Google's new artificial intelligence could change the game of SEO.
<h2>1. Keyword stuffing is out:</h2>
Keyword stuffing and link loading have always been a dangerous game, even in Google's earliest days. With RankBrain, any attempts at black hat <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO strategy</a> may become even more obsolete. Because RankBrain's primary function is to break down difficult queries, it also has the ability to interpret ""difficult"" - or vague - search result content. The AI will be able to categorize content relevance more accurately to reveal query matches that were previously disconnected. This allows Google to hone in on better, more straightforward search results and eliminate any attempts at faking those rankings. Vague and wordy content simply won't fly.
<h2>2. Pay to play paid search is in:</h2>
More accurate search results also means that the average advertising agency may abandon the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">pay-per-impression</a> search model all together. Although this may seem like a radical statement, the potential is there. The less-expensive ""spray and pray"" model won't be as effective if all content - from advertisements to search results - becomes more aligned with searchers' expectations. Instead, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">pay-per-click</a> model will likely emerge as the favored (or even exclusive) paid search <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">strategy</a>. Because each click would represent a more engaged or qualified user, the price of this model will likely go up as well. Google will need to balance current paid search pricing with the emergence of better results to avoid advertising monopoly and give the little guys an equal opportunity to afford and participate in the new search order.
<h2>3. RankBrain offers a better user experience:</h2>
RankBrain will, without question, will lead to a better user experience. Google already has an excellent reputation for search results, but a more intelligent AI will only improve that reputation. Users can expect better results, more accurate information, easier access to information and knowledge, and a less frustrating browsing experience. RankBrain may do for Google what Google did for AskJeeves just a few decades ago. And, we just can't wait.
<h2>4. Computer generated content (may be) king:</h2>
Have you ever noticed how marketers like to crown someone or something king? Every time a new marketing trend hits, the debate continues: is content still king? And the answer is most certainly yes, with one minor exception. As search engine marketing becomes more accurate, the quality of information will need to improve as well. Computer generated content may be a way for SEO agencies to supplement their traditional <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/content-marketing/"">content creation</a> to ensure they have a healthy mix of content that is interesting and personalized. We still believe in that human touch, but after all, you can't compete with a computer when it comes to fact checking. Computer generated content can also close gaps around queries that currently don't have content thanks to RankBrain's ability to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">understand what users are actually looking for</a>.
<h2>5. SEO marketers bringing their A-game:</h2>
SEO marketers will need to bring their A-Game if they hope to compete against artificial intelligence. The role of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">strong content marketing agency</a> will become even more important as the need for truly meaningful, relevant content emerges against a deluge of new content loaded with facts and figures. To ensure human generated content continues to rank and remain relevant, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">SEO agencies</a> will need to raise the bar and generate more engaging content than ever before. Our bet is on the emergence of photo, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a>, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">rich media assets</a> to complement strict copy-based content. As consumers' attention span decreases and appetite for information increases, this hybrid content approach may become a win-win situation.
<h2>6. Not just the what, but the why:</h2>
What makes RankBrain so fascinating is that it's main goal is not only to understand what users are searching for, but why they are searching in the first place. Although Google has given no indication that they would share this information with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a>, we suspect that learnings from this initiative will find a way into the market as Google finds secure ways to do so without violating their users' privacy. As marketers, this prospect excites us more than any other because that ""why"" holds the key to brand loyalty, sales, retention, and advocacy.
Sometimes <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO marketing</a> doesn't seem as glamorous or sexy as traditional marketing, but we're here to tell you this is one of the coolest breakthroughs we've seen in search history. How we search and discover information, brands, and connections is not only the heart of marketing, but the heart of most modern human interactions.

5 reasons why social media marketing for hotels works,"Resort marketing is different than almost any other type of marketing because the product is uniquely service based. Resort marketing relies both on the product (your location, resort, or restaurant), and the people who turn that product from a venue into a dream destination and experience. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/social-media-management/"">Social media marketing</a> for hotels gives you a real look into your customers' experiences that you can't get from a resort site inspection or photo shoot. Using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media marketing</a> for hotels can revolutionize your training, feature and product release cycle, and business model. Here are a few quick tips:
<h2>1. Use social media marketing for hotels to discover post-trip feedback:</h2>
Customers who have had an amazing trip and want to share their experiences with the world often flock to social media while on their trip or within the first week after they return to share photos and anecdotes. On the flip side, guests who have had a negative experience will similarly hit the Twitterverse and review sites to spread the word. In both cases, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media agency</a> will be able to share real-time feedback about what's going on around your resort. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Social media marketing</a> allows you to aggregate the most important feedback and understand your guests' most common sentiments, trends, and insights. You can use this information to respond directly to individual experiences or make broader changes at your resort by using this feedback to train your staff.
<h2>2. Use social media marketing for hotels to understand booking and reservation challenges:</h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Social media marketing</a> is also important for resort marketing as a supplement to traditional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">web analytics</a>. If you use a digital agency to oversee your web analytics, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media marketing</a> is a natural complement. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">Web analytics</a> shows you when people are entering and leaving your website, whether they are completing certain tasks, and how often people are returning. Social media marketing often reveals the ""why"" behind these behaviors. If you discover that you have a high booking abandonment rate, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media marketing </a>may uncover that it's due to a bad site experience or feeling like there's some bait-and-switch at checkout, which you can then address. Because social media monitoring relies on user generated feedback, it helps you prioritize which tasks to address first based on how important it seems to your customers.
<h2>3. Use social media marketing for hotels to conduct market research:</h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Resort marketing relies on finding (and harnessing) the latest hospitality trends. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">Social media monitoring</a> gives you inside information into what guests expect, what they're seeing at other locations, and what they'd like to see in the future. Your marketing agency can help you interpret this data and pressure test new product ideas or concepts on social media - or simply listen in to keep a finger on the pulse of the industry. This information gives you a distinct advantage over your competition and leading insights to inform your business strategy for years to come.</span>
<h2>4. Use social media marketing for hotels to find brand advocates:</h2>
Although most people rely on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media marketing</a> for hotels to understand what customers are unhappy with, you can also use this information to find brand advocates and highlight what people really love. Don't underestimate the power of positive affirmation. If you see that a lot of customers love a certain aspect of your property, feature it more prominently in your resort marketing campaigns. Similarly, if they say service is top notch, find ways to reward your staff and encourage this type of behavior to continue.
<h2>5. Use social media marketing for hotels to get a bird's eye view of your brand:</h2>
Last, but certainly not least, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media marketing</a> for hotels gives you a bird's eye view of your brand. You'll be able to see if sentiments are generally positive or negative, as well as gauge how connected your target audience is with your brand. For new or prospective customer acquisition this is particularly important information. Depending on your brand's general reputation or degree of brand loyalty, you can tailor your resort marketing efforts to those unique needs. This information will help inform broader <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy</a> and large-scale advertisements to position your resort within the marketplace or against your competitive set. Ultimately, social media marketing does so much more than track your Facebook feed - it reveals your customers' needs.",,5/4/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Resort-Marketing-1-copy.jpg,social-media-marketing-for-hotels,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
3 resort marketing tips that deliver results fast,"As summer vacations begin getting planned, warm weather inspires people to seek warmer waters, and tourism season kicks into full swing, now is a great time to parter with a Florida <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing/"">digital marketing agency</a> to supercharge your resort marketing strategy. Get ahead of your competition by harnessing these three great resort marketing tips this season.
<h2>1. Landing page strategy:</h2>
When we say ""landing page strategy,"" the glamor of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">event marketing campaigns</a> and sultry <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print ads</a> may not come to your mind, but your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> will probably feel differently. In light of Google's recent commitment to reduce the appearance of AdWords advertisements in search results, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing-and-strategy/"">paid digital media</a> - and the landing pages that go with them - will become an increasingly important trend for 2016 and 2017. By eliminating advertisements from the right rail of search results, your landing page (and only three other paid results) have the opportunity to pop up above the fold on search queries, immediately followed by highly relevant organic results.

The goal of Google's change was to provide searchers with more relevant information. The result is that your landing page will become far more important to seal the deal for prospective guests. Your digital marketing agency can craft a landing page that yields highly qualified leads and draws customers to the top of the marketing funnel. And here's an extra resort marketing tip for free: better leads means better business.
<h2>2. Partnerships and sweepstakes:</h2>
Any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Florida digital marketing agency</a> worth its salt knows that partnerships and sweepstakes can revolutionize your resort <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">marketing strategy</a>. Offering a free stay, which can then be advertised via partner <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">websites</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email</a> distribution lists, and mailers is a low cost in-kind exchange that often yields a gold mine of potential customer data. While this seems obvious, the main resort marketing tip and key to a successful sweepstakes or partnership is to align with other brands that naturally appeal to your customers. If you partner with brands that aren't closely aligned or that use broad, rather than narrow, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">targeting methodology</a>, your lead quality will dip (after all, people will do anything for a free stay at your resort, right?).

Having a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> that can fine tune your partnerships and break down the cost benefit analysis of what you're offering for the sweepstakes, tackle any legal restrictions, and execute strategy reduces legwork on your end so you can focus on cultivating your resulting prospects.
<h2>3. Enjoy the halo effect:</h2>
Resort marketing benefits from many of the same marketing psychology principles as luxury or lifestyle brands. Successful resort marketing helps prospective guests see themselves at your resort and imagine a lifestyle that goes with it. For this reason, endorsements can be a powerful tool. Chances are that your digital marketing agency already has relationships with a variety of local, national, or international tastemakers, celebrities, thought leaders, and industry names that can add a touch of excitement, authenticity, or luxury to your resort branding.

Your agency will help you identify mutually beneficial opportunities to broker an endorsement. These relationships could be as small as a media mention or as elaborate as celebrity-hosted fitness classes and events. Ideally, both you and your endorser will benefit from this relationship. You'll enjoy a halo effect of positive association, while your endorser may want increased press exposure, vacation perks, or some form of compensation. Your agency will help balance these needs so everyone wins.

Resort marketing should be as fun and fabulous as the resort experience itself, so use these tips to breathe life into your traditional marketing campaigns and tried-and-tested<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/conversion-marketing/""> lead generation</a> efforts. These resort marketing tips not only help deliver results but break through the marketing clutter that can be distracting for your audience.",,5/2/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Resort-Marketing-2-copy.jpg,3-resort-marketing-tips-deliver-results,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
10 reasons why live broadcasting is one of the biggest trends,"To understand why live broadcasting is one of the hottest trends for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency"">digital marketing</a>, we first need to understand what all the fuss is about. When Meerkat, the first live broadcasting app, <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw"">debuted at the famed South By Southwest</a> (SXSW) conference, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> universe literally went insane. Since then, digital marketers have rallied around the variety of broadcasting software available to engage and attract customers to their brand in a new way. Here's why.
<h2>1. FOMO is real:</h2>
FOMO - or the ""fear of missing out"" - is a disease that has run rampant among millennials and the Generation Y. As users' lives become more visible and connected via <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a>, the peer pressure to participate in experiences and events (and tell the world they're doing so) has increased exponentially. This phenomena primed the stage for broadcasting software such as Meerkat and Periscope so users can take part in their friends' experiences in more profound ways, even when they're not there.
<h2>2. Globalization and events:</h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Broadcasting apps</a> close gaps in distance and time. Brands that once relied on physical proximity to attract new customers to events needed to spend huge amounts of time and money to execute these inbound marketing techniques. Today, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your advertising agency</a> can host a smaller event (in more remote or exclusive location) and broadcast the experience into the social media universe. Businesses will still enjoy the benefits of inbound marketing leads at a fraction of the cost, without compromising their brand experience in the slightest.
<h2>3. Fishing where the fish are:</h2>
According to YouTube, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html"">1 in 3 Internet users view some form of video content every single day</a>. At 33%, that's one of the most engaged forms of content on the market. A good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> knows that engaged users lead to better leads (pun intended) and a stronger <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing strategy</a>. Broadcasting even the most mundane experiences inside a company can make that organization seem more authentic and human, igniting prospective customer curiosity and boosting brand engagement.
<h2>4. Exclusivity for everyone:</h2>
The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">top digital marketing agency</a> isn't the only one to benefit from broadcasting technology either. Apps like Periscope give consumers access to lifestyle brands and experiences they crave. Broadcasting is like an exclusive invitation to an event or experience that many users would never have otherwise. The appeal lies in consumers' natural desire to align with aspirational brands and individuals, giving lifestyle brands a particular leg up when using broadcasting for inbound marketing initiatives.
<h2>5. People love videos:</h2>
Cell phones have made video sharing easy, SnapChat has made video sharing fun, GoPro has made video sharing amazing. And now, broadcasting has made <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/web-video-production-agency/"">video sharing the newest trend</a> for every digital marketing agency surfing the Internet. People love <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">videos</a>, so it's no surprise that the types of tools marketers are using are adapting to fit this need. Broadcasting makes inbound discovery and marketing much easier than other form of video interaction.
<h2>6. Plenty to choose from:</h2>
Depending on your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a>, your preference, and needs, your business has a variety of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">broadcasting apps</a> to choose from. The top three in the market are Periscope, Meerkat, Stre.Am. All of these new entrants boast robust video sharing and streaming functionality, a solid user base, and nothing but untapped potential. Work with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your digital marketing agency</a> to understand the differences between each and choose the platform that's best for your audience before committing to your first broadcasting endeavor.
<h2>7. Live broadcasting is not a fad:</h2>
When Instagram and SnapChat first entered the market, marketers were skeptical to get in on the action because they thought the popularity may be a fad. It's no surprise that live broadcasting is receiving similar doubts from more traditional advertising agency representatives. We are here to debunk that myth. Periscope, Meerkat, and Stre.Am have more than 5 billion impressions collectively, which is a huge market of untapped marketing potential. And most certainly not a fad.
<h2>8. Live broadcasting drives new levels of brand engagement:</h2>
Aside from the obvious benefits of inbound prospects and heightened awareness, we believe that live broadcasting has the potential to connect customers with brands they love more organically. Wouldn't it be amazing to spend a day in the life of your favorite brand's executive? What if you could attend Apple's product launch event ... in the front row ... Sitting next to the company's lead engineer? Court side seats to your favorite basketball game? Yes please. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand engagement</a> (and monetization) potential are nearly endless.
<h2>9. An inbound marketer's dream:</h2>
Talk to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> about how to get involved in the trend. Live broadcasting is here to stay, and your company is poised to benefit from this unique and exciting trend. It's always great to have a pro in your corner, so leverage your agency's expertise to determine what broadcasting is right for your brand, who to target, and what types of inbound marketing KPI's you can expect to see as the trend grows.
<h2>10. How your business can win with live broadcasting:</h2>
Right now, the biggest benefit for businesses is the potential for inbound marketing leads. As the trend evolves, we expect new advertising potential will emerge, as will restrictions on what can be broadcasted and when (we know there are some early privacy concerns as well). Together, we will set the tone for how live broadcasting impacts the market and what business owners can expect from this emerging technology.

We know you're a trend setter (that's why you're reading this blog, right?), so download Meerkat or one of the other live broadcasting apps we mentioned above and experience the excitement and magic of being front and center all the time. We have a feeling you'll be as enthusiastic as we were and might even feel a rush of your own FOMO soon.",,5/3/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Live-broadcasting-inbound-marketing-copy.jpg,live-broadcasting-trends-digital-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
10 reasons why Instagram's new API is breaking the Internet,"When Facebook announced Instagram's new API and a major shift that meant everyone from the biggest corporate company to the smallest <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/content-marketing"">content marketing</a> agency could create and share their advertisements on Instagram (a previously heavily gated experience curated by Instagram specialists to ensure each advertisement blended in with users' existing content stream), the Internet <strong><em>exploded</em></strong> into discussion. Some people believe this is the best thing to happen to advertising since ... well ... Instagram. Others felt this was the beginning of the end of purely user-generated content and advertisement free browsing. Although the verdict is still out, these are some of the top discussions happening right now:
<h2>1. Introducing more ads ... Or is it?:</h2>
One of the biggest concerns users have is that their feed will suddenly be filled with ads. Because Instagram does not hide or minimize any content, there would be no way to escape a deluge of new advertisements. Instagram <wbr />hasn't clarified if the quantity of ads will increase, whether companies will have to pay for more exposure, or if they will simply diversify the types of ads users see. For now, only time will tell.
<h2>2. Quality vs. quantity:</h2>
One aspect almost all users and leading <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency experts</a> agree on is that advertisement quality is likely to suffer. In the past, Instagram has enforced strict guidelines on the advertising experience. All images were generated in-house at Instagram, all verbiage cleared by their creative team, and all targeting triple checked before going live. Instagram's new API will allow brands to use their own assets to upload and share content (via Salesforce or other marketing tools) which could lead to a dip in quality ... we sincerely hope not in tandem with an increase in quantity.
<h2>3. The road not taken:</h2>
Those who oppose Instagram's new API are upset because Instagram represented one of the last places where users could browse content created by them, not for them. Instagram was a unique experience and prided itself on not participating in the mainstream monetization of social media. When Facebook purchased Instagram in 2012, people knew it was only a matter of time. Many of the complaints around this change stem from fear that an influx in advertisements would rob users of an experience they have grown to love.
<h2>4. Hipsters, authenticity, and advertisements, oh my:</h2>
If the artistic hipsters, sunset-loving celebutantes, selfie-stick-toting travelers, and millennials flee Instagram, what will the platform become? And what will replace it? For the sake of the large (somewhat demanding) user base that embraced Instagram's unique authenticity and purity, we suspect Instagram will need to scale back on the level of freedom they grant advertisers to avoid risking user abandonment.
<h2>5. Keeping that 2.8 average:</h2>
We would be remiss to remind you that Instagram has had advertisements for several years and that Insta-ads typically yield a 2.8 return on investment when compared with other <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/social-media-management"">social media advertisements</a>. The reason for this return is simple: high user engagement and the flawless <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/"">design strategy</a> Instagram used to keep those ads on the cutting edge of creativity and relevance. As long as Instagram (and any participating advertising agency) can maintain the same level of engagement after their new API goes live, all this fuss might be worth it's weight in gold. Read: see above that 2.8 average. Way above.
<h2>6. Content is still king:</h2>
For Instagram to pull this off (and for your business to benefit), your <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing-agency"">digital marketing agency</a> needs to remember that content is still king. We don't believe that Instagram's new API is the end of the social media ecosystem as we know it. In fact, we believe this change poses a unique challenge for all marketers and industry professionals to step up their creativity and get back to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">hard hitting marketing strategy</a>, instead of churning and burning meaningless campaigns and hoping they stick.
<h2>7. Hail the new king:</h2>
If Instagram encourages businesses and marketers to serve better content to their customers, Instagram may become even more relevant than it is now. Instead of abandoning the platform, new users could flock to Instagram knowing that they'll be receiving hyper-personalized content that they actually want to see. This would make Instagram the new king of social media and possibly even Google or other search platforms in terms of pure advertising and conversion potential.
<h2>8. The future of filtering (and we don't mean Ludwig):</h2>
Another way to mitigate risk is for Instagram to introduce new filtering tools to users' feeds. This would fundamentally change the structure of Instagram and the never-ending content flow users seem to enjoy, but may solve for the advertiser's dilemma if Instagram's new API starts driving users away. In the same way that users can currently tab into their followers' activity, their photo feed, and individual profile tags, Instagram could use some form of tagging or filtering to enhance the user experience as their advertising model evolves.
<h2>9. This really could be a good thing:</h2>
Love it or hate it, the only things certain in life are death and taxes. And change. Instagram, like every platform before it and every platform that will come after it, needs to evolve with current marketing trends and business needs. Even with shock and outrage from the Internet, Instagram is launching their new API. Instead of fighting it, we recommend on capitalizing on it and making the experience better for all parties involved - you as a user and your advertising agency partner.
<h2>10. Who is next?:</h2>
So that leaves us with only one question left: who is next? Because we know that Instagram won't be the last platform to radically change their marketing techniques as customers crave more tailored advertising content and highly individualized marketing experiences.",,5/7/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Instagram-API-copy.jpg,instagrams-new-api,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Human generated content marketing vs. computer generated content,"We normally wouldn't start out by giving you a homework assignment, but when we're about to start talking like Orson Welles, it doesn't hurt to frame the conversation. When's the last time you considered how human generated <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/content-marketing"">content marketing</a> would compete with computer generated content? First, read the following two sports overviews from the New York Times:
<h2>Overview 1:</h2>
“Things looked bleak for the Angels when they trailed by two runs in the ninth inning, but Los Angeles recovered thanks to a key single from Vladimir Guerrero to pull out a 7-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on Sunday.”
<h2>Overview 2:</h2>
“The University of Michigan baseball team used a four-run fifth inning to salvage the final game in its three-game weekend series with Iowa, winning 7-5 on Saturday afternoon (<span class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_642822511""><span class=""aQJ"">April 24</span></span>) at the Wilpon Baseball Complex, home of historic Ray Fisher Stadium.”
<h2>Human content marketing vs. computer generated content</h2>
Did they sound feasible? Did anything stand out between them? And - <em>mic drop</em> - did you realize that one of them wasn't written by a human? We didn't think so. In a study conducted at <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140314164137.htm"">Karlstad University in Sweden</a>, most readers could not tell the difference between a computer generated article and a piece written by actual people (creepy, we think not). When compared, they indicated computer generated content was drier, but equally trustworthy and realistic. Okay, now that you've re-read them, let's take a look at what this means for the future of marketing.

The reality is, you've probably read plenty of computer generated content already, ranging from financial reports, to news articles, and press releases. News agencies, big businesses, and financial institutions are leaning on computer generated content algorithms to keep up with the media's insatiable appetite for up-to-the-minute information. Until now, computers have not begun generating advertising content marketing or fiction (although a few attempts at poetry have debuted with reasonable success). That isn't to say that they won't or can't - however.
<h2>Implications for the digital marketing agency:</h2>
Aside from a vague sense that this could probably be a subject for this summer's artificial intelligence blockbuster hit, the rising emergence of computer generated content has very real implications for the traditional content marketing agency and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a>. Some scientists estimate that close to 90% of news could be created by a computer as this technology progresses. But will that make content writers obsolete?

We'd like to think not (after all, we are very much enjoying writing this article). And all it takes is but one conversation with Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana to doubt that a computer could ever fully replace human vernacular. When we read Overview 1, which was written by a human, we agreed with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">consumer research</a> that there was a warmth and colloquialism that set it apart from Overview 2, which was written by a computer. When tapping into content that speaks to our customers' psyches and turns transactions into brand love affairs, we aren't convinced that a computer can ever replace the wit and wisdom of a writer's craft.

But what if?

As this technology evolves and becomes refined - or even proves us wrong - it may change how you interact with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your digital marketing agency</a> or advertising agency. Instead of working with them on editing and crafting content, you may be honing in on your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO strategy</a> to ensure your content ranks highest, that your keywords are the most specific to your customers, and that your content is found rather than generated.
<h2>How computer generation content will impact SEO:</h2>
This type of shift would also profoundly impact <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/search-engine-optimization"">SEO</a> strategy as well. If content becomes increasingly automated, it stands to reason that the act of categorizing and sorting it could also become more automated. We aren't sure that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO strategists</a> would become obsolete either, banking on a new wave of competition between human generated content and computer generated content forged over nuanced distinctions between whether the searcher is seeking emotional or entertaining content versus informative or educational information.

What is certain is that as computer generated content floods the internet, there will be a much greater volume of content to sort, and search engines will have to balance between simply serving facts and figures (which would logically rank highest due to their high relevance and accuracy) against information that intrigues or inspires the mind (which may deserve a spot above the fold too).
<h2>Last but not least, what about consumers:</h2>
Despite any knee jerk reactions we might have about artificial intelligence or a begrudging bias against computers that can write better than us, the reality of this revolution is pretty remarkable. Refined computer generated content will allow customers to find information without wading through opinions, outdated facts, and biased content. Forget Wikipedia, evolved computer generated content could create a new knowledge center that surpasses every encyclopedia and Internet source we've ever seen. The implications are endless for the consumer, student, healthcare provider, or curious mind.

The verdict is still out, but we think the fact that most consumers aren't aware how much computer generated content they're already consuming shows great promise for its potential when applied with thoughtfulness and judgment. We believe that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your digital marketing agency</a> will continue to serve your customers the right content at the right time, but computer generated content will allow you to educate them even more about the benefits of your brand and services in concert with your other marketing efforts.

Like most industry disrupters, the future of computer generated content is unclear, but the potential is there.",,5/6/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-future-of-now-copy.jpg,human-content-marketing-vs-computer-generated-content,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
Adobe announces co-op for the Adobe Marketing Cloud,"Unless you work for Google or Facebook, one of your biggest pain points is probably distinguishing which channels are performing best. When attributing conversion credit across your online channels, you or your <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing"">digital marketing agency</a> analysts may use a variety of methods to determine who gets the win. Do you use the last touch model, giving credit to the desktop site where your customer closed their transaction? Do you try to spread allocation evenly across all devices and channels in case your customer realized they wanted to purchase while surfing your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media sites</a> from their iPad? Do you think that first touch <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">introductory email promotion</a> is more valuable? Or do you just feel like giving up? We feel your pain.

Until now, Google and Facebook have enjoyed a tight premium on solving this problem. Because these social media platforms use single sign on technology that allows customers to travel between devices while easily logging in (and subsequently staying logged in) to a variety of connected applications and sites. Because these platforms also log their users' name and personal data rather than simply assigning them a number or unique identifier, it's easy for these organizations to track their users' exact behavior across all devices and channels. Every time a customer visits a site - regardless of device or whether or not they feel inclined to enter their login information again - Google and Facebook can easily track their behavior. Of course, companies are eager to get in on this premium information, and happily pay a premium price for it.

Without a partnership with Google or Facebook, companies had to attempt to cobble together a picture using user cookies, cross referenced with their IP address, cross referenced by any login information that user deigned to provide. In other words, an incomplete picture. Last week, <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/news-room/pressreleases/201603/032216AdobeCrossDeviceMarketing.html"">Adobe announced</a> they'd be making a huge stride toward closing this knowledge gap in the new Adobe Marketing Cloud. Enter the first cross-device co-op.
<h2>What is Adobe Marketing Cloud's cross device co-op:</h2>
Adobe Marketing Cloud's cross-device co-op will allow companies both big and small to submit a variety of customer data to a highly secured ""cryptographically hashed login ID and HTTP header"" that will at once log, aggregate, and encrypt all customer data. Don't let the tech speak fool you, the bottom line is that companies will be able to see when their customers are switching between devices and how they are behaving on each.

The trick is that the picture becomes clearer as more companies (and thus their user data) join the co-op, but no company will receive an unfair benefit because marketers will only be able to access information about their existing customers rather than new or potential users. The co-op also protects all user information so only their cross-device behavior is available, while new information (such as email address, mailing information, or cross-site log in information) remains securely off limits to co-op participants. Adobe worked with the Future of Privacy Forum to ensure the co-op structure met all current privacy regulations and expectations while still providing real value to co-op members.

Although the cross-device co-op won't debut for several months and Adobe hasn't released specifics for co-op participants yet, it could revolutionize our ability to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">tailor marketing content</a> in more meaningful ways. This announcement heralds one of the biggest digital marketing breakthroughs we've seen in years ... and with Adobe's name and reputation of excellence stamped on the project, we expect great things.
<h2>How do you benefit from Adobe Marketing Cloud's new co-op:</h2>
You may be asking yourself how you receive value from the co-op if you don't receive customer information? The answer lies in using your newfound understanding of what your customers are doing on which device to provide more tailored content. We recommend partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">content marketing agency</a> to craft specific campaigns that speak to your customers' needs depending on what device they are on. Serving the right information at the right time can help prepare your prospects to make an informed and confident purchase decision. This moves potential customers to point of sale more quickly and ensures they are choosing the right product for their needs, which boosts retention and lifetime value.

If you don't have an advertising agency by the time Adobe Marketing Cloud's cross-device co-op goes live, take time to carefully unpack each channel's behavior before launching new advertising campaigns into market. Supplement this information with user testing and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a> to ensure you understand the ways your customers are moving in and out of the purchase journey. The co-op will help. You will make the content relevant. The co-op will not provide a new bevy of customer data that was previously off limits or give you insight into other brands that they engage with, instead, it will help you understand your existing customers' psychology and create a deeper bond by speaking to them directly. The co-op will support the ever-growing emphasis on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">individualized marketing content</a> and highly personalized targeting and advertising efforts.

We believe Adobe's co-op will be the first of many efforts to break down our blind spots and serve our customers better without invading their privacy. Marketing is a delicate balance between advertising products and educating consumers so their needs are met in new and unique ways. Tools that allow us to understand how customers prefer to interact with brands helps us accomplish this goal. The results give us a new opportunity to discover customer needs they never knew they even had and bring them closer to brands in more meaningful ways.",,5/9/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Adobe-announces-copy.jpg,adobe-marketing-cloud,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Will customers embrace the new sponsored Instagram ads?,"When Instagram first debuted, people flocked to the quick and easy, transactional photo sharing application. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, users' photos were truly worth a thousand words. With no elaborate profiles or deeper agenda beyond documenting and sharing photos, Instagram was a class all its own. Pithy captions, profile links, and subtle calls to action have since become the norm; but the heart of Instagram has remained a personal photo sharing experience. One of the biggest differentiators for Instagram was that were no sponsored Instagram ads. <em>Ever.</em> At that time, 100% of all content was user generated.

Then in 2012, Facebook purchased Instagram (for a cool, one billion dollars). Although Facebook's advertisement model has worked well and continues to be one of the most lucrative <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social platforms for advertisers</a>, the social media giant realized they could not map the Facebook experience directly onto Instagram. Today, that may be changing. Here's a brief history of  sponsored Instagram ads, previous <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">advertising strategies</a>, and what's on the horizon.
<h2>Why sponsored Instagram ads worked in the past:</h2>
When Instagram went live, their <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing-and-strategy/"">digital marketing strategy</a> was somewhat unclear. But like many great ideas, it was only a matter of time before someone found a way to monetize this experience. Unlike Facebook, which only serves approximately 10% - 20% of all content to any given user, Instagram users see every piece of content that hits their feed. This presented a unique opportunity for marketers because users were used to seeing content that was completely relevant to their tastes.

To protect this experience, Facebook very carefully introduced sponsored Instagram ads into the mix and monitored everything from conceptualization to implementation for each and every sponsored Instagram advertisement. Brands (via their<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing""> digital marketing agency</a>) were able to subtly advertise products, destinations, and services by adding links to their photos and profiles without disrupting the social ecosystem because user engagement was so high.

They used a precise algorithm to serve highly personalized and targeted ads (that looked exactly like user content) to individuals who shared a variety of success indicators with a given brand. Facebook imposed strict guidelines on what sponsored Instagram ads could show, the type of verbiage that was appropriate, and how prospects were targeted. The results were phenomenal. Many users did not choose to opt out of ads (or even realize they were receiving ads) and began to engage with new brands in deeper and meaningful ways. Instagram and Facebook had cracked the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">future of digital marketing</a> for every business and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> in the world. Talk about a game changer.
<h2>How it will continue to work in the future:</h2>
But things are changing. Instagram is now taking their advertising techniques one step farther. They will soon use a new API to connect popular <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">social media marketing agency platforms</a>, such as Salesforce and Brand Networks, to their users' Instagram feeds. This means that every <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> and content marketing agency will be able to create and serve their own content to the Instagram network. While this may seem like a pool of untapped potential for your advertising agency, it's unclear how the Instagram user base will respond.
Instagram advertising will no longer be a highly-curated experience as agencies begin uploading (<em>flooding</em>) advertisements into their user feeds. Despite the risk, the rewards seem to outweigh any immediate concerns. Instagram will enjoy a more traditional<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/""> pay-to-play advertising</a> model while your social media marketing agency will now be able to move campaigns to market more quickly. Smaller companies that could not afford to participate in Instagram's previous advertising model will now have an opportunity to get in on the action, and larger companies will receive even more advertising perks. It goes without saying what Instagram stands to gain ... But just in case: the results, according to <a href=""http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Instagram-Mobile-Ad-Revenues-Reach-281-Billion-Worldwide-2017/1012774"">eMarkter forecasts</a>, is an increase in ad revenue from $600 million to $2.8 billion by 2017.
<h2>What these changes mean for your business:</h2>
If you're working with an advertising agency or <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/content-marketing/"">content marketing agency</a>, they have probably already begun thinking about how to leverage this new experience for your business. And if you don't have an agency yet, now is a good time to get one. Instagram advertising is poised for success before the market becomes saturated with advertisements. Being an early entrant into the new Instagram advertising structure gives you a unique opportunity to participate in the system and reap the benefits before users grow tired of receiving ads.

It's hard to say how long this current Instagram marketing trend will last (after all, users may become less engaged with the ads - or worse - less engaged with the platform entirely if their feeds are flooded with content that does not interest them). For now, however, Instagram still represents nothing but opportunity, so it's a great time to get in on the action.
<h2>What it means for your customers:</h2>
As marketers, we're naturally excited about this opportunity, but we also hope both Instagram and our advertising peers step up their game to ensure that all content that does go into the Insta-world still meets the same standards their user base has grown to love and expect. In many ways, Instagram is both the final frontier for strictly user-generated content (which we love!), and the first step toward right-for-me, highly-targeted, 100% customized content. The tipping point will be in the balance of how these ads are crafted and whether our desire to advertise wins out over our desire to engage our audiences.

We know, we're getting deep (see above). But we genuinely look forward to seeing how this new API system fares and how customers embrace these changes. If we have anything to say in it, these changes reaffirm our commitment to superlative content marketing and highly-engaging campaigns that delight and surprise users at every stage in the customer journey.",,4/29/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bigeye-Instagram.jpg,sponsored-instagram-ads,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"4 unconventional, creative ways to perform market research","Customer insights are solid gold. They unlock the door to commercial innovation, help you understand the latent needs of your target audience, and spark ideas for future products. It would be hard for any marketer to dispute the value of <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/research/"">market research</a>. What we are going to dispute is the misconception that market research has to be expensive.

If you have the budget for it, there is nothing wrong with investing in big data, qualitative customer insights interviews, market reports, and high-powered consultants. All of these tools are very effective at gathering and aggregating customer insights. When an advertising agency harnesses these insights to a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">creative campaign</a>, they can have a huge impact.

But those aren't the only ways to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">perform market research</a>. Entrepreneurs, small- and medium-sized business owners, scrappy startups, and even frugal corporate heavyweights have plenty of options to collect remarkably accurate market research using lean methodology that does more with less. These four unconventional and creative ways to perform market research are as inexpensive as they are efficient. The best part is, they also yield near immediate results so you can go to market faster.

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/social-media-management/"">Social media</a> isn't usually considered a market research tool, but don't let that fool you. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">Social media platforms</a> such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, are mini focus groups that allow you to read (and respond to) customer comments, giving you a real-time view into the cause-and-effects that actually influence customer behavior. You can also introduce questions about possible new features or products into your forum, share surveys and polls, and even reach out to customers for one-on-one feedback about their experience. All for free.

Because many websites also use social media to enable single sign on customer login, social platforms have a wealth of data about where else your customers are shopping and socializing. While you may not be able to see the full picture or harness the full depth of that information without partnering (or paying) those platforms directly, you can conduct your own <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">qualitative research</a> by looking at what your top users and social advocates are doing online. We know it may sound a little old fashioned or labor intensive, so partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> can make your life easier ... but go ahead and do a little Facebook stalking, see what you can learn, and don't be afraid to introduce yourself to learn more from time to time.
<h2>Research lifestreaming:</h2>
If you want to enjoy similar benefits but take some of the legwork out of trolling social media sites for nuggets of information, research firm Harris Interactive's new platform built for the modern <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing"">digital marketing agency</a>, Research Lifestreaming, may be just the tool you were looking for. This tool offers a unique view into both your customers' social media activity and more direct customer feedback. Customers opt in by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">linking their social media sites</a> to the Research Lifestreaming platform and then participating in surveys, polls, and discussions regarding various experiences and products. Customers are rewarded for their insights with monetary gift certificates or merchandise.

The tool provides a much more holistic picture into the market's behavior and how social actions correspond to real actions. Because users also choose to participate in the Research Lifestreaming platform, you don't need to worry about being perceived as pushy or soliciting unwelcome information. The downside is that you can't completely control the users you get to interact with. Although these individuals are all willing to share information, you aren't receiving information from customers who had a bad experience or those who may be less inclined to share. In reality, you aren't receiving customer information at all. There's no guarantee that participating in Research Lifestreaming is representative of your customer segment. That said, because users choose how and where to participate on the platform, it's safe to assume that respondents are self-selecting into experiences they would engage with in the wild and your digital marketing agency can help interpret results into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">actionable strategy</a>. In this way, Research Lifestreaming provides exceptional directional insight into customer behavior and broad market temperature.
<h2>User testing:</h2>
If you crave more granular information, consider using simple user testing software such as <a href=""http://usertesting.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">usertesting.com</a>. This is one of our favorite <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">customer research</a> tools to gain insight into task completion and user experience functionality. Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> can help you prepare product prototypes, show customers your actual homepage, or ask them to imagine themselves in a situation and complete a task such as purchasing a product or searching for information. Each testing session is recorded, so you'll be able to watch (and listen to users comment on) their experience every step of the way.

User testing provides a very narrow, but accurate view into market behavior. This can be invaluable when preparing for a product launch or revamping your online presence. Like Research Lifestreaming, you are somewhat limited by who signs up to participate on <a href=""http://usertesting.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">usertesting.com</a>. It's important to remember that while lean <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a> doesn't give you an infallible look at customer behavior, it's often faster and easier to collect. Responses from user testing are usually available within hours, rather than months (as is the case with traditional market research). With these tools, you can supercharge your testing and iteration process to meet your customers' needs faster.
<h2>Site surveys:</h2>
And don't forget about adding a customer survey to your homepage. You can ask simple questions like why they came to your site, or more broad questions like what they like or dislike your brand. Give them the option to respond with simple yes/no or radio button answers, or add their own verbatims. Survey creation software such as Qualaroo is easy to implement with a few clicks of a button, so everyone from a seasoned <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> to the most non-tech savvy companies can take advantage of this tool.
No matter how you choose to collect market research, the most important element is that you are connecting and engaging with your customers. How you do it - is just the details.",,5/11/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/creative-market-research-copy.jpg,creative-market-research,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
WTF is cross-device tracking? And what you need to know about it,"Cross-device tracking is a popular marketing term used to describe our ability to observe customers' behavior as they navigate between devices. Here's how it works in real life. For example, you might hear about a new product while you're watching television. Because you're already surfing Facebook on your tablet, you might simply search for the product in Facebook or Google. That's one touch point. On Monday morning, you might need a little break (and some retail therapy) during work and revisit that site from your smartphone. That's two touch points. You see a promotional offering, so you enter your email. That's three. Then it's back to the grind until you get home, shift through your email again, and complete the purchase - promo code and all - from your desktop computer. That's four. At minimum.

Unless you enter your email and log in each time you visit that site, chances are that this company thinks you are a new user every time you visit. This makes it difficult for them to know what type of information you need at any given time. During the discovery phase, you may simply want general product information. Eventually, you may want to see social proof of how other customers liked your product, promo codes, and deep benefit descriptions. Knowing what customers are really looking for allows you or your <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing"">digital marketing agency</a> to better meet your prospects needs.

If you're new to the cross-device debate, here is everything you need to know about why it's important and what we can and cannot do for our customers.
<h2>What exactly is cross-device tracking:</h2>
Right now, cross device tracking is somewhat limited. As we mentioned above, unless a customer logs in on each device, which they usually don't because there's no intrinsic value in logging in until they're ready to make a purchase, your digital marketing agency will be somewhat blind about cross-device behavior.

Right now, companies use a combination of website cookies from past logins and IP address mapping to make rough estimates about who is doing what, where, and when. In other words, that's a lot of guess work. Customers that surf the web on a private browser or clear their cache and delete or restrict their cookies, complicate this issue even further.
<h2>Why do businesses care about tracking:</h2>
Although it may seem like a lot of work to crack the cross-device question, businesses know there is huge value in understanding this piece of user behavior. When you consider companies such as Amazon or Netflix that recognize their customers across devices and applications, the value becomes a little clearer.

These companies are able to carefully select and serve content based on their customers' behavior. Usually, we see this in the form of product recommendations, suggested automatic reorders, and highly tailored promotional offerings that drive sales. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">good digital marketing agency</a> can also parse out the type of content a customer needs on a certain device. For example, most big-ticket purchases, such as a cruise or vacation, may start with some research and discovery on a mobile device or tablet, but the sale itself almost always happens on a desktop computer. Conversely, close to <a href=""https://www.cmocouncil.org/facts-stats-categories.php?view=all&amp;category=mobile-marketing"">40% of small retail goods are sold via a mobile device or app</a>. The customer experience is not a one device fits all model, and your marketing shouldn't be either.
<h2>Are there any solutions out there:</h2>
Aside from Amazon and Netflix, two companies that notoriously nail cross-device tracking are Google and Facebook. Because these brands allow and encourage users to stay logged in on a variety of devices, they are able to track customer exit and entry points to and from their sites. That means they know where you're going when you leave (see, that advertisement for a new gym in town really did work!), and where you're coming from. This success is compounded because many other sites use Facebook or Google as a single sign on entry point to log in or register for their sites, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">expanding these social media</a> giants' visibility even further.

Recently, Adobe also announced the arrival of an up-and-coming cross-device co-op. The premise hinges on a variety of companies sharing data about their existing customers to close this gap. The good news for customers is that no co-op participants will receive additional private or personal data. That is to say, if your customer entered an email address and phone number on one site, but visited a second site and only provided their name, neither company will receive that additional information. Instead of sharing data, the co-op will simply provide insight into how customers are migrating between devices so marketers can do their job better. Although many details of the co-op are still private, Adobe worked with the Forum for Future Privacy to ensure customers were fully protected as they built this information exchange.
<h2>How will this impact my business:</h2>
If done right, successful cross-device tracking will allow marketers to cut back on advertising clutter, and encourage every advertising agency to get crisper about what they release in the market. Long-term, it could mean fewer advertisements and the emergence of more relevant, tailored content. In the short-term, it enables businesses to begin targeting content to their customers' expectations, which will also improve the customer experience.

Cross-device tracking is still a relatively new marketing discipline, but you and your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> will undoubtedly find new ways to harness this potential as more products like Adobe's cross-device co-op make it easier to serve your customers the right information at the right time.",,5/10/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WTF-cross-device-tracking-2.jpg,wtf-cross-device-tracking,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"Our thoughts on Instagram video's new, cool updates","Instagram is switching things up. The traditional photo-sharing application is attempting to encourage more Instagram <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">video sharing</a>. If it's not broken, why fix it you may ask? Our best guess: perhaps in a bid to compete with emerging platforms such as SnapChat and Vine that already do this, or to give marketers the opportunity to tap into Instagram's 400-million user-base with compelling, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">rich video advertisements</a>. Is it coincidental that Instagram's video-sharing enhancements will occur the same time they announced they will soon allow your <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/social-media-management/"">social media marketing agency</a> to upload their own digital advertising content directly to your customers' feed (a process that was previously heavily restricted and cost-inhibitive to the average small- or medium-sized business)? <em>We think not.</em> Here are some marketing insiders' top four questions about how these changes will impact the Instagram ecosystem and - our thoughts on each.
<h2>So, what's changing about Instagram video sharing?</h2>
Users (and more importantly, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing"">digital marketing agency</a> analysts) will soon be able to see the number of times a given video was watched. This model will mirror watch counters on YouTube and Facebook, heralding the popularity of a given video. For users, this is one additional point of validation for their own content and a natural point of alignment with their expectations of how other social media platforms work. No big deal.

For marketers, this gives us the ability to gauge how impactful our advertising content really is and what content is generating more interest than others. This will allow the average <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> or advertising agency to create more robust and targeted content. Knowing that cat videos are getting more hits than dog videos may not seem like the lynchpin to a successful marketing campaign, but knowing that customers prefer to see product demos versus customer testimonials or lifestyle campaigns is.
<h2>Who will be impacted?</h2>
Strictly speaking, this change will not dramatically impact the average Instagram user's experience. Those who are inclined to look at the video watch counter will do so, and may be inspired to try their hand at video sharing. Beyond that, the change will feel relatively innocuous. No content will be weighted or ranked above any other based on views, so users will continue to see every post that enters their feed in the order it arrives.

This is why we suspect the real benefit of this change lies in untapped marketing potential for brands and advertisers. Brands are already using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/web-video-production-agency/"">Instagram video</a> to showcase more complicated products or engage users in more meaningful ways (this works especially well for luxury or lifestyle brands such as cars, vacation destinations, restaurants, and high fashion goods). Knowing whether these efforts are working and being able to compare and contrast certain types of content with other types of content gives marketers a competitive edge. It also allows brands to spend less money on production or advertising by getting it right the first - or at least the second - time they <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">release a video into market</a>.
<h2>And this is a good thing, right?</h2>
Coincidentally, this update occurs simultaneously with Instagram's other announcement that they will begin allowing the average advertising agency to upload ads directly to their users' Instagram feed. Instagr<wbr />am has released a new API that can pull content from marketing platforms such as Salesforce so marketers can create, load, and schedule advertisements without assistance from Instagram.

In the past, Instagram has enjoyed tremendous success releasing advertisements into the user experience because they have overseen the creative process from start to finish. Not a single advertisement could go to market without the Instagram seal of approval. This system kept ads in line with the authentic, artsy vibe Instagram users were creating on their own. In this way, advertisements were less intrusive or sales-oriented than traditional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">social media paid ads</a> on similar platforms such as Facebook or Twitter.

The main complaint about Instagram's impending advertising API is that this new experience will break the system. The quality of ads will dramatically drop. Engagement will then drop. And Instagram will be forced to release more ads into the market to close the profits gap. As long as Instagram does not open the floodgates for every ad to enter market, it's true that the real danger lies in the ads themselves becoming less relevant or compelling than they once were. And we doubt any Instagram-artist worth their salt will be too pleased to see that change.

There's good news though. We believe the advent of this video counter can actually serve as a tool to help marketing agencies get clearer on the type of content that works. A video counter allows your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> to use each <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a> as a mini focus group, for quick directional data, better decision making, and better advertisements. Instagram isn'<wbr />t abandoning their principles, they're giving your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> the tools they need to do their job better. Sure, Instagram's team of creative experts knows how to capture the essence of your target audience's latent needs ... but you and your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> should be able to do that on your own too.

When we push aside our fear that autonomous ad posting simply means more ads, we see an opportunity for marketers to work smarter, not harder.
<h2>Do Consumers Agree?</h2>
It's hard to guess how consumers will react to Instagram video's latest changes. It is more likely that customers will notice a change in their advertisements sooner than the addition to a video counter, but their overarching reaction is impossible to estimate without a clearer picture into the types of ads that will enter the marker. We like to think of this as a challenge: let's make your next Instagram video campaign so good that users still don't know the difference. Problem solved.",,5/13/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Instagram-Video-Update-copy.jpg,our-thoughts-instagram-video,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"5 awesome, unconventional marketing tactics you need to use","In a world where ROI and the bottom line rule marketing, sometimes it's easy to forget about the fun, audacious, sometimes unconventional marketing tactics that probably drew you to the industry in the first place. We would never advocate that tracking your return on investment isn't critical to the health and growth of your business; but rather, that we, as marketers, love to swing for the grand slam. For us, it's all about finding the perfect balance between <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">tried-and-tested marketing</a> techniques and a few unconventional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">marketing tactics and campaigns</a> with the power to disrupt the market and break through the clutter. Here are a few of our favorite awesome, unconventional marketing tactics.
<h2>1. Work for free:</h2>
When you pose this idea to your financial planning analyst, you may want to put a little marketing spin on the verbiage, but we're just going to say it: you <em>can</em> get something for nothing. Offering a free consultation, inviting customers to try your services or products before they buy, doing pro-bono work, or giving high impact lectures (gasp!) for free can attract prospective customers who might have otherwise been on the fence. This technique works especially well for products that can't be sold as a necessity, require customer education such as consulting or dietitian services, or are new entrants into the market. If you're stuck on what might be of value to your target audience, lean on your <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing agency</a> or advertising agency to do some research about what ""hooks"" - whether it's features, face time with the CEO, or freebies - would get them in the door.
<h2>2. Take advantage of the halo effect:</h2>
It stands to reason that if you can be guilty by association, you can also look incredible by association too. The phenomenon in which a person or product enjoys increased <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand association</a> or a boost in perceived customer value thanks to alignment with another, more powerful or popular brand is called the ""halo effect."" Established brands releasing a niche product sometimes use this to attract loyal customers to new markets, but any company can take advantage of this trend. On the local level, find charitable organizations, popular public figures or tastemakers, or trendy venues where you can host an event and start making connections. Most people and organizations are willing to exchange in-kind marketing collateral such as: access to shared <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/email-marketing/"">email lists</a> or exclusive discounts for your cross customer base when there is a mutually beneficial fit. This technique can scale all the way up to the national or global level depending on how dedicated you are. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">good marketing agency</a> will likely have pre-existing contacts and ideas on what might be a good alignment, so start there.
<h2>3. Build a memorable brand:</h2>
Do something quirky. Make mistakes. Be human. Even the most corporate, buttoned-up organizations can benefit from moments of humanity. Recognizing that there is a time, place, and audience who responds to this type of marketing and balancing it against more conventional messaging and imaging is key. Perhaps you limit the funkiness to your Snapchat or Instagram feed, or maybe you run simultaneous campaigns that target both sides of the same coin. A great example of an organization that does this well is Geico. Ask any millennial or hipster and they can probably cite several of the silly ""Switch to Geico - it's what you do"" advertisements featuring everything from an addled Tarzan, to a dog stealing spaghetti from its owners' plates. None of these ads mention the comprehensive asset protection or excellent customer service Geico has built a reputation on. That information is reserved for prospective customers looking for a quote or surfing their online space. What these ads do is disrupt a mature, saturated market and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">raise awareness</a> that then drives prospects farther down the funnel and into exploration mode. Trust us, they are laughing all the way to the bank.
<h2>4. Everyone loves a themed party:</h2>
Think: product launches, fundraisers, new menu launches, release events, and more. The opportunities to host an event are near endless. Although the upfront cost and work of hosting an event can seem inhibitive, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing agency</a> will help you offset this pain point and set measurable goals. Events often serve the dual purpose of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">raising brand awareness</a> and generating leads. The trick is to host an event that speaks to your audience. Too often, organizations jump on an opportunity to attend an event without a clear understanding of who is actually in attendance. They generate leads by bribing unsuspecting bystanders to exchange contact information for freebies, but the quality of these type of leads is often low ... people will do anything for a free t-shirt, right? Instead, get crisp on the type of customer you want to attract. If you are launching a new line of skincare products, consider hosting a spa party. If you're releasing the newest issue of a community magazine, go for the hottest new venue in town. Everything from the theme to the event programming should <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">speak to the people</a> who would truly use your products or services.
<h2>5. Blog, blog, blog:</h2>
And then blog some more. This is such a simple, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/account-based-marketing-services/"">low-effort marketing technique</a> with tremendous potential. All you have to do is consider the amount of amateur marketers and online celebrities who are consistently making thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, garnering huge followings, and receiving coveted brand endorsements to see the potential in blogging. Blogging is still often overlooked in the marketing mix because it is sometimes hard to quantify the return on investment and requires nurturing to build a readership. That said, it only takes one person to find a niche topic that attracts prospective customers and brand partners (see above and remember that halo effect) to start a blog. Any good <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/digital-marketing/"">digital marketing agency</a> or <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/content-marketing"">content marketing agency</a> can support your in-house blog writing to ensure your content is relevant and consistent. If you aren't ready for the full commitment, consider writing guest blog posts that are popular <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">among your audience</a> to test the waters and build out a larger blog program from there.
These unconventional marketing tactics are not only fun - they are effective and are an excellent compliment to your traditional marketing campaigns and initiatives. It really is okay to think outside the box.",,5/1/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Unconventional-Marketing-Tactics-copy.jpg,unconventional-marketing-tactics,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
5 inbound marketing strategies to attract quality leads,"Many marketers believe that <a href=""http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/the-most-expensive-way-to-grow-a-business/"">lead generation is an expensive, laborious task</a>. And, sure, it can be... but it doesn't have to be. Strong inbound marketing campaigns and robust content strategies can help you and your business generate highly qualified leads without blowing all your resources in one place.

Over the next quarter, pick one or two of our top five lead generation and inbound strategy tips to test with your customers. You'll be surprised at how simple and effective these tools can be to engage new (and former) customers.
<h2><strong>1. Personalized content and inbound marketing: </strong></h2>
Using personalized content to spur inbound marketing activity is one of the most effective ways to generate qualified leads. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Personalized content</a> is three times more likely to generate clicks and leads than non-personalized content. Whether you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">send emails</a> using your customers' first names or grab their attention or leverage <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeted display ads</a> reminding customers of items they previously browsed, highly personalized content is a great way to keep your product top of mind and nudge customers toward the lead or purchase funnel.
<h2><strong>2. Social media incentives: </strong></h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">Social media</a> is another lynchpin in a strong lead generation and inbound strategy. Turn your current customers into advocates and encourage them to share your content, invite friends to visit your homepage, and review your products online. This increases natural exposure to your site and encourages new customers to reach out and get to know your brand better. Reviews and recommendations are one of the most trusted referral sources for new customers, so don't underestimate the power these simple social tools can have on your lead generation capabilities.
<h2><strong>3. Clear features and benefits invite customers to your inbound marketing campaign: </strong></h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">Content marketing strategy</a> starts with wrapping each and every one of your product features in customer benefits. Focus on the direct business benefits or lifestyle perks your product is associated with. As customers project themselves into your brand lifestyle while reading blogs or seeing clear product benefits in a well placed Instagram campaign, they will be encouraged to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">do more research</a> and seek out additional information about your brand. As they self select into your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a>, onto your landing pages, and into your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">social campaigns</a> the inbound leas will roll in.
<h2><strong>4. Email campaigns: </strong></h2>
Even though <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> sometimes gets a bad wrap thanks to increased anti-spam laws and a deluge of, well, spammy email marketing, it can be a highly effective lead generation tool when used properly. To revitalize traditional email lead campaigns, we suggest going way outside the box. Host an event (you'll be shocked at the number of qualified leads your ticket sales yield), partner with a local charity or institution to tag-team off their email lists, or offer crazy-shareable flash email sales that beg to be forwarded. This radical take on email campaigns will drive inbound marketing leads as customers are tempted to share, attending, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/website-maintenance-services/"">engage with your website</a>.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>5. Affiliate partnerships </strong></h2>
The saying that two heads are better than one is especially true for lead generation. Affiliate partnerships let you align your brand with another organization that shares your mission statement or vision. You can create exclusive content, deals, or experiences for your shared audience and enjoy a halo effect of positive vibes, qualified leads, and customer purchases. Affiliate partnerships are especially good for generating qualified leads and inbound marketing benefits because you can pool resources and creativity to do more with less.

These five tips and tricks are so easy, you might not even think you're generating leads, which is why inbound marketing is such a powerful tool to find customers who are pre-qualified to love your brand.

Blogging conundrum: Thought leadership vs. educational content,"In our Beginner's Guide to Blogging for Your Business post, we recommend outlining clear, measurable <a href=""https://blog.bufferapp.com/blogging-advice-for-beginners-from-16-experts"">goals for your blog</a> before beginning to write. One of the main reasons we suggest this is to avoid the age-old blogging conundrum: thought leadership vs. educational content. Educational posts are the cornerstone of content marketing and inbound marketing strategy. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">They boost SEO</a>, help your customers onboard successfully, and provide deep brand value. Thought leadership, however, gives you a chance to expand your brand, encourage new product innovations, and express your unique opinions in a relevant and meaningful forum.
<h2><strong>Understanding the difference</strong></h2>
To determine which type of blogging content is best for you and your business, carefully consider the differences between thought leadership and educational content.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Educational content: </strong>Educational content provides practice insight into your industry or product. For example, you may create a ""how to"" article, discuss what certain industry terms are, or how the market is performing. Typically, this content is highly rated by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search engines</a> because it is very relevant for customers searching for answers to their search queries and provides direct insight into your product or brand. Educational blogging keeps your content relevant, bolsters the chances of organic traffic and inbound marketing efforts taking hold, and helps customers with their day-to-day needs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Thought leadership content: </strong>Thought leadership, on the other hand, is more editorial and allows you to express opinions or experiment with new ideas. Blogging with thought leadership in mind encourages more freedom and creativity, and may generate more viral, shareable content. In this way, both content types have benefits, but thought leadership focuses less on search metrics and more on engagement or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social share ability</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Resource centers and blogging</strong></h2>
If you find yourself drawn to both types of content, consider simply segmenting your posts into two buckets. There's no denying that educational content is extremely beneficial for customers, but the creative writer in us all secretly longs for a platform to share our ideas and innovations. The solution? Resource centers and blogs.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Resource centers: </strong>Resource centers are a great place to share and store educational content. This allows you to take advantage of all the inbound marketing and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">SEO benefits</a> of this type of writing, without feeling guilty about filling your blog with straightforward information and FAQ's. Resource centers can be tagged and indexed across your site for deep organic search benefits and provide a searchable library of product information and facts.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Blogging: </strong>Use blogging for your most creative thoughts and posts. Unlike educational content that has a definitive answer, your blog can be as subjective as you want. Blog posts tend to be more viral and shareable, so ensuring your posts are connected to all your social sites is crucial. For lead generation, having highly engaging and unique content is key. There's no need to get caught up in the dry facts and figures customers expect to find in your homepage search bar and resource center. This is your opportunity to showcase your personality.</li>
</ul>
Both forms of content are highly valuable in their own rights. It's up to you to choose the balance that's best for your business and what your individual content strategy goals are. Depending on your resources and availability to write, you may choose one over the other, or try to do a bit of both. Either way, as long as your content serves your over arches business strategy, you are on target.",,5/20/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Beginners-Guide-to-Blogging-copy.jpg,blogging-thought-leadership-vs-educational-content,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How buyer personas now drive inbound marketing leads,"The art of inbound marketing lets customers find you rather than spending time, energy and money soliciting qualified (and sometimes unqualified) leads. This <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">marketing strategy</a> is the quintessential manifestation of fishing where the fish are. In plain words, you simply place your product in the path of your potential customers and let them do the work for you.

Okay, we might be exaggerating a little here. For inbound marketing to successfully attract value able customers, you need to know exactly where to place your product and ensure its perceived value appeals to your prospective customers. Don't worry, inbound marketing won't put you out of a job ... it'll just make yours a whole lot easier.

So, you may be asking yourself: What is a buyer persona, anyway? We're glad you asked.
<h2><strong>Buyer personas 101: </strong></h2>
A buyer persona is a snapshot into your ideal customer's psyche. Typically, a product may have several personas based on different customer archetypes that successfully engage with your brand. Many companies create a persona profile - complete with name, photo, educational background lifestyle, profession, and business needs. This makes it easy for marketers to role play or think as their buyer persona when discussing how to develop a marketing strategy or what content might resonate with them most.
<h2><strong>How do you create a buyer persona? </strong></h2>
To create a buyer persona, the recipe is simple. Data, data, and more data. Get your hands on as much qualitative and quantitative research about your customers as possible. Ask customers why they cancel their subscriptions, poll customers leaving your website, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">set up a focus group</a>, or reach out over <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> to gather sound bites and directional insight into your customer's pain points and needs. On the flip side, consider investing in third party research, set up AB or multi-variate tests, and do some data mining to gather information about your buyers' behavior.

When you translate all this data into a buyer persona, you'll find ""ah ha"" moments that can lead to prototyping and commercial innovation that will lead to success. Anyone can create a buyer persona, but seasoned marketing strategists and agencies and product managers are highly adept at this type of task.
<h2><strong>How does my persona drive inbound marketing?</strong></h2>
Once you have several <a href=""http://engage.synecoretech.com/marketing-technology-for-growth/bid/206140/Why-Buyer-Personas-are-Crucial-to-Inbound-Marketing-Success"">buyer personas</a>, you can use them to tailor your inbound marketing efforts. Paste your personas onto poser board and bring them into meetings. Let someone role play as a persona each session to generate customer-centric ideas. Give each persona to a marketer and have them research where they surf online, how they behave, and where they are shopping so you can advertise in those naturally aligned spaces.

Having a tight buyer persona not only lets you think like your customer (and deliver better marketing content), but helps you frame where your inbound marketing efforts will be most effective. The results are more personalized and authentic marketing and a better customer-product fit. This leads to happier customers, greater customer lifetime value, and a bigger bottom line. In other words, everyone wins.",,5/22/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Buying-Persona-Filtered-copy.jpg,buyer-personas-drives-inbound-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How to build a kick ass B2B content marketing strategy,"A flawless B2B content marketing strategy starts with clearly understanding that B2C customers don't act like <a href=""https://www.aabacosmallbusiness.com/advisor/6-things-know-b2b-customer-023209106.html"">B2B customers</a>. For the most part, yes, the customer is always right, and yes, your purchasers are still customers; but there are a few fundamental differences between B2B and B2C sales cycles that you need to understand in order to successfully build B2B content. Before you build your content marketing strategy, it's important to understand these distinctions.
<h2><strong>B2B vs. B2C customers: </strong></h2>
Before we go any farther, let's frame the key differences between B2B and B2C customers.
<ul>
 	<li>B2B sales are usually larger, enterprise purchases</li>
 	<li>Security, technical or installation requirements, and ROI are (usually) very important to B2B customers</li>
 	<li>B2C purchases are often driven by emotion, whereas B2B purchases tend to be more pragmatic</li>
 	<li>Legacy B2B purchase rely on longer sales cycles and deep, trusted relationships between buyers and consumers</li>
 	<li>Large corporations buy differently than small or medium sized businesses</li>
</ul>
While these are all generalities, remembering these five facts will help you effectively frame a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> worthy of the most seasoned business badass -- no matter how big or small your company, or your target audience's companies are.
<h2><strong>The two no's: no fluff and k(NO)w your audience</strong></h2>
If you take nothing else from this post, remember the two no's.

First, no fluff. Business content should clearly communicate your product's unique value proposition or provide information that your target audience needs to do business. Business jargon and marketing fluff that boost your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO ranking</a> or fill up your website pages won't be enough to close a sale for price sensitive startups or heavy hitting CEOs.

... Which is why you need to k(NO)w your audience. Realize that B2B transactions are solving for a customer pain point, so it's important to understand those needs and communicate what your product does to solve them up front. In that vein, it's important to realize that the person who is trying or testing your product or researching possible solutions in market, may not be the ultimate decision maker or purchasing power. Provide information that will satisfy both personas so your researcher can sway the ultimate decision maker effectively. To do this, we usually recommend a balance of clear, data-driven information about your product and content marketing moments that let your brand personality shine.

A kickass B2B content marketing strategy starts with thinking with the customer in mind first. And while that isn't any different from crafting a stellar B2C content marketing strategy at all, it may inform your tone, information architecture, and help frame your features and benefits more clearly for your business user.

4 tips to build a lead generating content marketing strategy,"Chances are, the saying ""content is king"" has been drilled into your head by everyone from top inbound <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> organizations such as Hubspot, to lead generation experts such as Marketo's VP of Demand Generation Heidi Bullock, to your fresh-faced MBA intern with killer ideas to supercharge your company blog. It's safe to say we all agree that good content results in better leads and more engaged users. The question is: how does content actually generate leads?

Once you have a storehouse of shareable, interesting, and educational material, what do you do to harness it's qualified lead generation potential? Here are four tips to help you build a strong <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> tailored to your business needs.
<h2><strong>1. Content marketing secures leads: </strong></h2>
One of the most effective ways to secure qualified leads is through gated content. If you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">know your target audience</a> will really want to read your blog post or latest tutorial, put it behind a digital gate. Before downloading or accessing the content, prospective customers will need to provide their email address or other contact information. The catch is making sure customers receive enough value from this content to outweigh their hesitation of being spammed after they provide their contact information. Ask yourself if you would give your email address away for the content before gating anything. If you have even a moment's hesitation, it's time to promote a new content king. Also, make sure your content marketing targets top of funnel prospects. While gating a product ""how-to"" PDF may get you lots of leads, chances are these leads have already signed up for a free trial and are ready to use your product. Stick with information that is tangentially related to your product, or of interest to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> but that doesn't directly apply to current users.
<h2><strong>2. Plan ahead, create a content calendar: </strong></h2>
Sharing the right content at the right time is a key ingredient when <a href=""https://webrunnermedia.com/blog/"">generating leads</a> for your content marketing strategy. Freakonomics author, Steven Levitt, shares a story about a hardware company that tried to measure the ROI of their newspaper ads against their digital spend. Because the digital advertisements only ran the day before major consumer holidays (think: Black Friday and Father's Day), whereas the newspaper ads ran every Sunday, the ROI of the digital ads looked substantially higher than the newspaper placements. It's not that the content in the digital ads was more effective than the newspaper ads, but rather, that the content was being served at the right time for the customer. Understand your target audience's sales cycle, when they shop, where they shop, and when promotions will most likely appeal to them. Craft content that hooks them in around these key sales triggers so you always have a few pieces of highly effective lead generation material locked and loaded throughout the year.
<h2><strong>3. Search landing pages:</strong></h2>
Congratulations! If you - like almost every other company out there - spend any money on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid search advertisements</a>, you are probably wasting plenty of that money when your current customers click your search ads to log into your site or access their account information. The good news is, we have a solution. We recommend a two-pronged approach to solve this problem and ensure your customers and prospects are finding the right information in the right places. First, tailor your search ads toward non-branded terms that are related to your product and spend less on your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand name</a> itself. This way, customers who are searching for products like yours will find your landing page, but current customers who already know you, will be more likely to click an organic search page rather than a paid ad. Next, splurge on an amazing copywriter or agency to tackle your landing page. Your landing page should introduce your product, give customers enough information to tease them into wanting to learn more, and then direct them to a trial sign up, gated content, or sales funnel.
<h2><strong>4. Blog posts and viral leads:</strong></h2>
Last, but certainly not least, don't forget about the power of your blog posts. If you are consistently writing relevant, interesting content, people will want to keep visiting your blog. As they sign up for your newsletter or opt in to your email list, you'll receive an influx of exceptional leads. Nurture them with email offers and right-for-me content that keeps them coming back again and again. As an added bonus, each time these followers share your content, you have the chance to gain new leads through their viral exposure. Even if you can only dedicate an hour a week to your blog, or partner with an agency to craft content on your behalf, you'll be priming your business for a self-renewing pipeline of business leads.

These four tips are simple, straightforward, and highly effective in transforming content into customers. And chances are, if you already have a content marketing strategy, these lead generation tips will easily fit into your existing plan.

A beginner's guide to best blogging practices for your business,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">Blogging</a> can be a fun, <a href=""http://www.zerys.com/content-marketing-blog-1/bid/83185/5-Ways-To-Use-Blogging-To-Grow-Your-Business"">effective way to grow your content marketing strategy</a> and flex your creative muscles. It can help you become an acclaimed industry expert, learn new things, establish credibility in your brand, and generate qualified leads. Blogging can even - dare we say - offer a relaxing outlet from the hustle and bustle of your daily grind. When considering how blogging might fit into your business strategy, don't dive directly into the content creation and writing process. Chances are, you'll burn out quickly or abandon the project before it gets off the ground. Instead, follow our beginner's guide to blogging for your business to set up an effective, sustainable blog ecosystem that will delight and engage your target audience.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Start with a goal before blogging: </strong></h2>
Before doing anything else, ask yourself what success looks like. If you simply want to indulge in the intersection between your academic and professional passions, your blogging goals will be substantially different than if you're trying to generate a 25% increase in qualified marketing leads. There's no right or wrong answer here. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">Content marketing</a> blogs have tons of passive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/seo-search-engine-optimization/"">SEO</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">social media</a> benefits even if your primary objective isn't to directly target new customers. However, if that <em>is</em> your goal, blogging won't disappoint. Get clear on what you want to achieve and then start thinking about how you're going to do it.
<h2><strong>Let's talk logistics: </strong></h2>
Next, have a realistic discussion with yourself (or your team, or content marketing agency) about logistics: where will the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">blog</a> be hosted? Will you do this yourself or pay someone to manage it on your behalf? How much do you want to spend? Do you have a team who can write content in-house? How many blog posts do you want per week? Per month? Do you want your blog to be connected to your main site or on a separate domain? Do you want corresponding social media accounts? The list goes on. You get the picture. The logistics can sometimes feel overwhelming and are, without question, less fun than blogging itself, so tackle them first. If you're feeling overwhelmed just reading this post, chances are you might want to speak with your content marketing agency to iron out the details. Trust us, we're happy to help. If you prefer the DIY approach, at least decide how often you want to write and where you'll post your blog entries before committing to anything else.
<h2><strong>Research and read:</strong></h2>
It may seem intuitive, but one of the best ways to start blogging is to read other blogs. Find out what other people in your industry are reading and why they like those blogs versus the thousands of other posts out there. Sign up for email lists, see what's working, and what's not working in the market. You may find inspiration, get a sense of what you want your blog to look or feel like, and even a few things you want to avoid. Almost every marketing site has a blog these days, so it's important to understand what's keeping users engaged. Since you are a user (or, at the very least, a proxy for your customer as a user), your eye is as good as any when judging what feels right in the highly subjective blogosphere.
<h2><strong>Find your niche: </strong></h2>
That said, it's important to find your niche. Your blog shouldn't be an exact duplicate of a wildly successful, related blog. You don't want to go into head-to-head content marketing competition with a heavy hitter or professional content creation wizard. Instead, soak up as much inspiration as you can and tweak their success into something uniquely you. The most successful new blogs target a niche audience or subject that hasn't been tapped out yet. Don't be afraid to ask your customers on social media what they'd like to learn more about, take informal email polls, or ask friends and co-workers what they think would keep readers interested.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Start blogging: </strong></h2>
Once you've decided on a niche topic, polished your target audience, and set up your shiny new <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">blog</a> platform, it's time to start writing. Many new bloggers express fear over writing and posting their first entry. It doesn't need to be perfect and it doesn't need to capture the core essence of your blog. These things will evolve organically as you find your voice and develop a following. Just start writing. Brainstorm a list of topics you want to write about that will engage your target audience and then just go for it. You can always edit or remove your posts later.

The most important thing to remember when blogging for business is to be consistent. Consistently write to stay relevant and consistently generate content that will help you reach your lead generation or engagement goals. Quality is more important than quantity, so we recommend fewer consistently great posts than tons of mediocre entries that no one wants to read. Happy blogging!",,5/19/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Beginner-Blogger-Filtered-copy.jpg,beginners-guide-blogging-business,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

Grow your email marketing list like a boss with these 5 resources,"<p class=""Body"">We have what can only be described as a good news, bad news scenario to share with you. Let's start with the bad news. According to <span class=""Hyperlink0""><a href=""http://www.hubspot.com/database-decay"">HubSpot</a></span>, one of our favorite inbound marketing partners, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> list, loses approximately 22.5% of its subscribers every year. The good news is, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> is still one of the most lucrative and highly engaged consumer channels you have in your arsenal of marketing tools. Now just imagine what your ROI could be if you were growing your email marketing list at a 22.5% annual rate! To help you grow your email marketing list like a boss and turn those subscribers into qualified leads, we recommend these five tips and resources.<b> </b></p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>1. Stop losing subscribers: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">We've all heard the saying that retaining a customer is more valuable (and less expensive) than finding a new customer. The same holds true for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> list. Before turning your focus toward inbound marketing tactics to grow your list, make sure your current <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> is relevant to your reader base and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a>. Great content keeps your current users engaged and makes the rest of these recommendations easier to implement and maintain. For ideas on how to energize your content marketing strategy and keep users engaged, we love <span class=""Hyperlink0""><a href=""https://contently.com/strategist/"">Contently's Content Strategist</a></span> blog.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>2. Make opting-in to your email marketing list easy: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">If you have great content: share it. And make it easy for your readers to come back for more. Add subscribe buttons to your employees' email signatures, share your content with an opt-in link via <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, include a newsletter or blog subscription button on every page and in your footer. Every inbound marketing and email lead may discover your content and website through different channels, so don't assume that your visitors know where to look to subscribe to your email list or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">learn more about your brand</a>. <span class=""s1"">Your opt-in buttons should be ubiquitous throughout your site along with inbound marketing efforts you have in market. </span>Get crisp on how to unclutter your site, reduce competing CTA's, and create a hierarchy of marketing information for your customers on <span class=""Hyperlink0""><a href=""http://unbounce.com/blog/"">Unbounce</a></span>. This go-to conversion site will help you understand how to make opting-in to your email marketing list easier than ever.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>3. You can't go wrong with email marketing promotions: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">One of the quickest and easiest ways to build a solid email marketing list is to offer promotions or contests. Think about the last time you logged onto a retail site and traded your email for a discount code or chance to win free merchandise. The exchange is a win-win situation. The customer gets a promotion, and the brand receives your email information. Provided your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">content strategy</a> is strong, this customer will keep coming back and engaging with your products as you email new promotions or share interesting content. Use <span class=""Hyperlink0""><a href=""http://coschedule.com/blog/"">CoSchedule</a></span> to help you plan a content and promotional calendar that will tee up critical offers throughout the year that will be relevant to your target audience.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>4. Don't forget about social sharing: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Help your current customers and advocates help you by adding social sharing to your current email campaigns (check out <span class=""Hyperlink0""><a href=""http://www.emaildesignreview.com"">EmailDesignReview.com</a></span> for great ideas on how to creatively place sharing buttons), and to all your inbound marketing content. As people share your content, more people will sign up for your email marketing list to get in on the action. Social sharing is one of the main reasons your content marketing needs to be strong. Good content means more shares and more email leads.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""> <b>5. YOU should be sharing too: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">It should go without saying that you should be sharing your own content too. If you aren't tempted to share your blog posts, emails, and promotions with friends and family or ask people to opt in your list at networking events, chances are your content marketing isn't good enough yet. If you're not ready to drink your own Kool-Aid, ask yourself why. And then fix it. Team up with other passionate people in your office and transform your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing strategy</a> into something you are proud to promote.</p>

How Twitter marketing transformed social media marketing,"Sure it's entertaining, but <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, and Twitter in particular, have the power to shape the world as we know it. Unlike social media platforms such as Facebook, SnapChat, and Instagram that focus on users' one-to-one interaction with friends and family, Twitter opens up the world of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">political social influence</a>, journalism, and globalization. Twitter has enabled civilian news reporting, helped identify terrorists, and given the average person a snapshot into celebrity lifestyles. Brands that can successfully lever this instantaneous connection between users and their product can turn Twitter marketing into solid gold.
<h2><strong>THE POWER OF THE TWITTERVERSE: </strong></h2>
As a snapshot into the power of this unique platform, we can't help but muse about the current political debates. No matter who you plan to vote for this fall, you've probably seen your fair share of political tweets during the primary season.

As we write this, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump) has unleashed a near streaming Twitter attack on Hillary Clinton. In his latest post he cries out, ""Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor for Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!"" On the flip side, presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton), fights back, sharing a CNN (@CNNPolitics) article about Trump's 2006 views on the real estate market crash. She notes, ""A candidate who roots for his own gain at the expense of American families isn't just heartless. He's disqualified."" In just 140 characters, each candidate appeals to the public time and time again to hear them, share them, and agree with them.

So what happens when one of these candidates - or any highly public figure - endorses a brand, promotes tourism in a depressed market, or gets photographed wearing a designer t-shirt? Those brands immediately receive a boost of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">awareness</a> and have the opportunity to respond with their own Twitter marketing tactics in hopes of riding the halo effect of positive brand association, or shy away from an endorser who may not necessarily align with their brand values or vision statement.

Even brands that don't receive attention on the national or international scale have the ability to tweet with and align themselves beside other likeminded public figures and organization. The results are a web of interconnected, social associations that validate or disprove a brand's unique value proposition within a given market.
<h2><strong>HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TWITTER MARKETING POWER: </strong></h2>
Don't be afraid to dip your toe into the bird bath. Twitter may not have as many followers as platforms such as Facebook or LinkedIn, but it does have a unique personality and power all its own. To take advantage of Twitter marketing's potential, don't forget the following:
<h3><strong>1. Become an expert: </strong></h3>
Build your Twitter base by becoming an expert in one topic. If you have a blog, this is a perfect place to share your posts. Tweet relevant articles, share your opinion, and provide insight into your industry. Just remember that it's better to share excellent content about one topic than mediocre content about several.
<h3><strong>2. Engage with social influencers: </strong></h3>
It may feel strange at first, but start tweeting at other brands, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">social influencers</a> such as celebrities, industry tastemakers, journalists, and bloggers. Ask them questions, share information you think they may enjoy, and put yourself out there. It only takes a few retweets and heavy-hitting responses to boost your own social credibility.
<h3><strong>3. Increase your followers: </strong></h3>
The best way to increase your followers is to follow others. Take time to read other peoples' tweets and figure out who you enjoy watching. Many people will follow you if you follow them, so don't be shy.
<h3><strong>4. Stay relevant: </strong></h3>
Because Twitter has the power to break news (hello, viral videos) and is often used to provide real-time commentary on social events, don't wait until you have the perfect article or post to tweet. Stay current and react to what's happening in the moment to keep your audience engaged.
<h3><strong>5. Try new things: </strong></h3>
Last, but not least, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">try new things</a>. A Tweet can be forgotten in a mere matter of minutes if it gets lost in a flood of more interesting or share worthy content. If you try to tweet something outside your comfort zone, don't worry. Try again.
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our social media marketing team can help you create a content calendar, refine your tweeting skills, and highlight brands and public figures that align well with your brand.

Why your business can't live without brand guidelines,"When staring down your marketing ""to-do"" list, creating a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">brand guide</a> might not immediately rank in your top five. We know you have <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a> to conduct, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">websites to optimize</a>, leads to cultivate, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> to perfect. The ROI on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional marketing</a> tasks is far easier to track than the nebulous benefits of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand style guide</a> and, let's face it, you're busy. But did you know that creating brand guidelines is one of the key ingredients of business success? Whether you're a startup, a small-medium sized business, or a large corporation, you can't afford to skip creating a comprehensive brand positioning document. Here's why.
<h2><strong>Work less, get recognized more: </strong></h2>
In a blind <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">branding test</a> in which consumers were asked to name brands based on their company colors alone, branding powerhouses such as Google and McDonald's were easily identified at a 100% success rate without their logos. Some logos, such as Coca-Cola and Harvard Business School, are so easily recognized on the global scale that artistic rights to the artwork are estimated in the <em>millions</em>. Each. Clear, consistent branding helps customers recognize your brand using visual cues so that<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/""> certain symbols, colors, or imagery</a> become synonymous with your products. As these visual cues build positive association between your brand and purchase triggers, your marketing department will need to work less (and spend less) to stay at the top of your customers' minds. After all, seeing that signature Coca-Cola red is enough to inspire sales at most movie theaters. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand guide or brand guidelines</a> allow your organization to define what these cues will be and ensure they are consistently featured in marketing collateral.
<h2><strong>A brand guide is a shared language: </strong></h2>
A comprehensive brand guide also creates a shared language across all marketing channels so your team members can create <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">emails</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print ads</a>, event marketing banners, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/website-maintenance-services/"">website content</a> with ease. Having brand guidelines with all the design colors, fonts, tone, and information architecture guideline can reduce editing and churn during the internal production process, and get consistent collateral into market faster so you can - you guessed it - work less and get recognized more. Even the smallest teams will benefit from clear guidelines around when to use certain headlines, how to position text, and where and how a logo may be used. It turns the most tedious elements of design into a straightforward process, so your creative minds can spend less time double checking whether they are using the right shade of blue and more time dreaming up your next ADDY Award-winning campaign.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Brand positioning within your corporate culture: </strong></h2>
Branding is also a translation of your corporate culture. For example, Google executives once admitted they chose the brand's bold, primary colors because they wanted to build an organization around simplicity. They stripped away any unnecessary visual elements so this simplicity would shine. No frills, just results. Those same colors evoke the playful (sometimes childlike) nature of their corporate headquarters and echo a no frills, results-oriented work culture. The bright red, blue, and yellow of their logo would be as appropriate in a classroom or art studio as they are in the creative, casual work rooms and collaborative spaces inside Google offices. In this way, their branding choices reflect both their business principles and their corporate culture, setting a tone for customers, employees, and investors. Go ahead, ask yourself what your brand guide might say about your culture and what you're telling your prospective customers or investors every time you release a new ad.
<h2><strong>Aid onboarding with brand guidelines:</strong></h2>
Having a clear correlation between <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand guidelines</a> and corporate culture not only helps external parties understand your unique value proposition, but allows employees to self-select and assimilate to how your organization works with ease. Brand guidelines allow new team members to get to work faster because they understand the expectations around their work, digest the tone you hope to set both in and outside the office, and live your brand's mission and vision statement rather than just working on it.
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Brand guidelines are pivotal for business success because they allow each and every one of your employees to become an expert in your brand positioning.

UVP is the new marketing MVP: Supercharge your value proposition,"<p class=""Body"">Your unique value proposition or ""UVP"" is the new marketing MVP and calling card of your business. Think of it is as your three-second elevator pitch. This one-sentence mission statement should clearly set the tone for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a> and prime prospective customers to learn more. We might even go so far as to say that it's the single most important piece of content on your website.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Your unique value proposition answers at least one critical question for your customers, such as: what are you solving for them? How is your brand different from others? Or why should they be interested? Although every product marketing manager and production specialist on your team should be able to clearly explain your unique value proposition, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a> is first and foremost for your customers, so get painfully narrow on what makes your product different in their eyes.</p>
<p class=""Body"">To craft a unique value proposition that really shines, pick one of these four angles to build from.<b> </b></p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>EXPLAIN YOUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION</b>:</h2>
<p class=""Body"">If you've never thought about your UVP before, this is the perfect place to start. Find an elegant, clear way to state exactly what your product is about and get it in front of your prospects. For example, new pet-sitting startup DogVacay gets directly to the point. Their tag line, ""Find a loving dog sitter. Search thousands of trusted, insured pet sitters near you,"" explains what their product offers in under 12 words. This framing is especially useful if you have a complicated product because it forces you to get to the heart of why your product is valuable. Consider a more complex product such as Givling, a crowdfunded game site that gives players the chance to win money while paying off other peoples' student loan debts. Recipients and donors don't necessarily need to be players, so their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a> has the potential to become convoluted if the UVP isn't crystal clear. Givling answers the fundamental ""what"" by leading with, ""Play Trivia. End student debt. Win cash."" There is no question about what you can do on their site no matter who you are or why you're visiting. In other words, a perfect UVP.<b> </b></p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>USE THE K.I.S.S. MODEL: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">K.I.S.S.: Keep it simple, silly. Your unique value proposition doesn't need to be elaborate to be effective. Some of the most poignant <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning statements</a> are just a few words long. CrowdTunes, a digital jukebox, has an amazingly simple, yet powerful value proposition. They invite users to ""roll in and rock out."" The pithy, straightforward call to action captures both the tone and appeal of the brand. HubSpot, similarly, doesn't get into the nitty gritty. They promise to ""grow your business,"" and trust that this hook is enough to entice visitors to delve deeper into their world of inbound marketing support. As marketers, we sometimes get so excited about our products that we feel the need to explain every feature and benefit in our unique value proposition. Resist the temptation and boil your UVP down to the single most important thing your customers care about and lead with that. Short, sweet, and to the point.<b> </b></p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>THE EMOTIONAL APPEAL: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">For brands that offer more elective - rather than utilitarian - products, consider making an emotional appeal. Think: luxury, lifestyle, and hospitality brands. Norwegian Cruise Line is an amazing testament to how this type of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a> can work. Each of their cruise offerings leads with a reminder of what it means to be a ""Norwegian:"" Norwegians know their Saints (for their island itineraries), Norwegians chase the sun (in Mexico), Norwegians shop like mavens (referencing their onboard promenades). Their unique value proposition allows customers to project themselves into the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand's lifestyle and imagine</a> themselves as an insider. Resort clothing line Lou &amp; Gray takes a similar approach. They remind customers to ""get out there, our clothes are just along for the ride."" In each of these instances, the customer's emotional journey is at the center of the UVP rather than the product itself. This can be a powerful persuasive tool to boost the perceived value of more expensive products.<b> </b></p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>LEVERAGE SOCIAL PROOF: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">On the flip side, pragmatic products such as insurance, security, or business tools, can benefit tremendously from social proof. Framing your unique value proposition around statistics adds credibility to your brand and helps position your product against the competition. Web conferencing software GoToMeeting's UVP lets customers know that ""millions of businesses rely on GoToMeeting."" While Nationwide Insurance boasts that ""95% of members recommend Nationwide car insurance."" While neither of these statements necessarily explains what the product does (because prospects probably already know), they do answer critical customer questions about their brand differentiators and why the product is valuable. Social proof can augment UVP's in mature markets or for products where customers are extremely price sensitive.</p>
<p class=""Body"" style=""text-align: left;"">No matter how you choose to frame your UVP, the important thing is that your customers get something from your positioning statement. A good UVP can mean the difference between an engaged audience and blending in with the clutter, so take time to craft yours with care.</p>

Down and dirty social media: twitter ads like never before,"In a recent post, we discussed how Twitter is changing the world and earning you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">positive brand association</a>, one social media post at a time. Twitter is most known for it's organic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media advertising</a> potential, but Twitter ads come in several different formats so there are plenty of ways to take advantage of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid advertising</a> within the Twitterverse as well.

Here is a quick fact sheet on the three types of Twitter ads you can invest in. Just remember, it's not an ""either vs. or"" decision. A strong <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Twitter ads strategy</a> boosts exposure to unique tweets and compelling blogs alongside timely social media advertising to drive organic and paid traffic simultaneously.
<h2><strong>1. Promoted tweet twitter ads:</strong></h2>
Promoted tweets work best for promotions and short-term offers. Much like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid digital ads</a>, you can pay per impression or click, giving you flexibility in how you want to expose a certain deal. If you already have a strong brand following, but want to run a short term gap closing effort or increase end of quarter sales, this is a great way to kick off your campaign. Simply highlight your offer in 140 characters or less, add a trackable link to your post, and release it into the wild.
<h2><strong>2. Promoted account twitter ads: </strong></h2>
To <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">build brand awareness</a>, consider promoting your account. Instead of highlighting a specific tweet within your follower base, Twitter will recommend your account to users who may be interested in following your content. This is a great tactic for new or growing companies because Twitter can help you segment and target a certain audience within their follower base. You can choose the type of users that will see your brand, serving a warm introduction to your next crop of potential customers.
<h2><strong>3. Promoted trends twitter ads:</strong></h2>
Promoted trends are the least well-known option of Twitter's advertising arsenal. A promoted trend allows you to create a unique hashtag and begin a movement. We recommend using promoted trends if your marketing needs to fall somewhere between a short-term promotion and large-scale <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a>. If you plan to run a sponsored event series like a summer concert tour, have partnered on a product launch, or are trying to create a viral movement, a unique hashtag can give this effort momentum to grow. The trick is making sure the campaign has true viral potential and is simple and catchy enough to get off the ground.

Battle of The Brands: make a rockstar brand positioning statement,"As one of the pillars of the ""Four P's"" - positioning, product, placement, and price - your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a> statement serves as a fundamental part of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">go-to market strategy</a>. Before you decide what new features your product needs, what stores you want to sell in, and how much you want to charge, you need to clearly define your product position.

So let's get started. If your unique value proposition, or UVP, is why your customers should care about you (check out our blog on why your UVP is the new marketing MVP <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/supercharge-unique-value-proposition/"">here</a>), then your brand positioning statement is the internal equivalents of what you and your team are trying to accomplish. Your brand positioning statement explains the who and why you believe you're going to be successful so you can tailor each and every one of your marketing efforts accordingly.

Before writing your brand positioning statement, ask yourself the following for questions. To help guide you through this exercise, we'll use Zipcar as an example.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>1. Who is your target audience? </strong></h2>
No matter what industry you're in, start with a customer-centric mindset. Ask yourself who your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> is, what their pain points are, and what they care about most. Answering these questions will allow you to drill into your target audience's psyche and understand where your product fits into the consumer landscape. Knowing who you are trying to help and what you're trying to solve for them will inform almost every other decision you make about your product's <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a>.

<strong>Example: </strong>Zipcar's audience are urban, tech-savvy commuters. They are usually between the ages of 30 - 50 and fall in the middle- to upper-class socioeconomic brackets. They care about reliable transportation, and may struggle to find reliable public transportation in cities without developed bus or metro systems, or heavy traffic congestion and limited parking.
<h2><strong>2. Competitive combat vs. niche interest? </strong></h2>
To position your product for your audience, you also need to know whether you'll be trying to break through your competition's marketing clutter (in which case, you would be focusing on product differentiators and price points) or whether your product is a niche interest (meaning you'd focus on unique product placement and market education efforts). Do some <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/quantitative-research-services/"">research</a> about what products fall into your direct competitive and indirect competitive set. Take time to learn about their go-to market strategy and where your target audience overlaps or stands out.

<strong>Example: </strong>Zipcar was one of the first arrivals to the car-sharing market, but have since been joined by direct competition such as Car2Go and indirect competition from ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft. Knowing that Zipcar was one of the original market leaders gives them a unique value statement when positioning their brand as a thought leader and experienced service provider.
<h2><strong>3. What's your category and market context?</strong></h2>
If you're redefining or crafting your brand positioning statement for the first time, consider what your share of the industry wallet is. Is your product category new and growing rapidly, or mature and stable? Are people already familiar with products like yours or will you need to spend time educating the market? Are you trying to redefine yourself within a product segment? Is your market necessary (think: toothpaste, food, and gasoline) or elective (think: luxury items, gadgets, and travel).

<strong>Example: </strong>Positioning your product in a mature market, such as the public transit sector, requires a different mindset than pioneering a new way to commute. Zipcar, and the car-sharing market, is a new category that complements the emerging crowdsourcing craze. The market is growing and Zipcar is a market leader. When positioning their brand, Zipcar will want to focus on maintaining their current customer base while educating new entrants into the crowdsourcing craze about their unique option and value proposition.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>4. Why does your product matter? </strong></h2>
If you've answered the last four questions, you'll probably have a good idea about why your product matters. This fundamental question is your customers' - and your - reason to believe in your product. It ties together any remaining value statements or ""perks"" associated with your product and allows you to write a stellar brand positioning statement that will guide your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">marketing strategy</a> and product development roadmap.

<strong>Example: </strong>The finished product for Zipcar reads as follows: ""To urban-dwelling, educated techno-savvy consumers, when you use Zipcar car-sharing service instead of owning a car, you save money while reducing your carbon footprint."" This statement clearly explains who needs the product, provides a snapshot into the market context, and tacks on a reason to believe in the product itself.

&nbsp;

You may not be able to pack every detail from the four positioning questions into your brand positioning statement, but the essence of your own finished product should explain what you're doing, why you're doing it, and how it will transform the market.

Beyond client services: when/how to be friends with your clients,"It's no secret that people prefer to work with businesses and individuals they like. At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency</a>, we treat each and every one of our clients like members of our family because we aren't an exception to this rule. Fostering a work-friendly friendship with your prospects can round out your client services experience and make your projects more meaningful for both you and your clients. A connection may start with something as simple as sharing the same alma mater or bonding over a networking dinner, and can radically transform your customer relationships. Here's how.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>How friendship supports client services: </strong></h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">Building a friendship</a> with your clients can transform your day-to-day client services and allow you to work more closely with your business partners.
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Friendship builds trust: </strong></h3>
Friendship often leads to trust and allows you to be more open and direct with good-natured feedback, which in turn, encourages rallying together to overcome obstacles. When your client knows you care about them beyond their retainer fee, they can trust that you have their best interests at heart when you make recommendations or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">suggest a strategy</a> pivot. This trust helps streamline your client services protocol so decisions can be made more quickly and work can be done more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Personal vs. transactional work: </strong></h3>
Being friends with your clients can also help you tackle your work and their problems in more creative and innovative ways. When a client shifts from contract to comrade, your work ceases being transactional and becomes personal. Suddenly, you'll find yourself leaning into those follow up phone calls, creating a higher-touch client services experience, and caring deeply about the outcome of your clients' projects. It's not work when you love what you're doing and the people you're doing it with, so don't be afraid to invest your personal emotions into your clients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Keeps clients (and referrals) coming in: </strong></h3>
When you and your clients are happy, chances are you're succeeding together. As friends, you'll get to know each other better and may find yourselves hatching new ideas, brainstorming new projects, and connecting each other to potential business partners, resources, and future clients together. Your clients will soon become your biggest allies, referral source, and cheerleaders -- and you'll be there's.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Defining business-friendly friendship and flawless client services: </strong></h2>
The key to building a mutually beneficial business friendship is to do it for the right reasons and in the right ways. This starts by layering some of the fundamental values of friendship into your client services practice.
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Don't be right, be helpful: </strong></h3>
Bridge the gap between client and friendship by demonstrating that your first concern is helping your clients succeed. We know - and they know - you're an expert in your field (it's why they hired you), but don't trade off being right when situations get sticky when you should be bringing solutions to the table. The first tenant of any good client services relationship is to be helpful. From there, friendship can naturally bloom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong> Communication and transparency are key: </strong></h3>
Even if you don't have anything to share with your clients, or you're still waiting on a project status update, feel free to pick up the phone and give your clients a call. Ask them how they're doing. Find out how their other projects are developing. Offer to take them to lunch. And yes, we're going to say it: overshare. We're not talking about divulging the nitty gritty details of how your weekend went or who you're dating, but rather, to go over above and beyond the required communication cadence. This sets the tone of your client services and allows your relationship to live outside of the immediate tasks at hand. You'll find yourself wanting to grab a casual coffee together in no time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Celebrate shared wins: </strong></h3>
We can't stress enough how important celebrating shared success is. Taking time to pop some bubbly or to send a client flowers after a major coup shows you care and increases your own investment in your client relationships. There's also no better way to bring people together than in celebration. Bond over those shared feel-good moments by pulling your respective teams together and vowing not to talk about work for the night beyond the celebratory toast you and your client plan to give.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Don't use friendship as a crutch: </strong></h3>
Last, but not least, don't use friendship as a crutch. Once you establish a personal relationship with your client, don't abuse it by shirking deadlines or taking shortcuts. Your friendship should be an excuse to do your absolute best work rather than the bare minimum. And trust us, your client (no matter how good a friend they are) will see and feel the difference.</li>

"The four things you should never, ever do in business card design","<p class=""Body""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">Business card</a> design is not what it used to be. With so many printing options, DIY <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">business card companies</a>, paper thicknesses, foiling, glossing, photography overlays, shapes and sizes, it's easy to get caught up in wanting to create the most creative or luxurious <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">business card design</a> for your business. And there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Once you strip away all the bells and whistles, we believe that business card design should fall into one of two categories: simple, sleek and professional or radically creative. In either case, your card needs to clearly display your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo</a>, your contact information, and provide a relevant call to action about your business or brand.</p>
<p class=""Body"">While those three things are all given, there are four business card design trends you should never, ever fall prey to. Below, we share our hit list of business card faux pas and why they are bad for your business.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>1. Forget all the text you want to include on your business card design: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">business card</a> is not the place to teach prospects about your product or services. Overloading your business card design with cramped text or too much information can overwhelm the viewer and detract from the contact information on the card. The primary goal of your business card should be to encourage customers to reach out, surf your website, or give you a call. Leave them wanting more by including a simple catch phrase or invitation for a free consultation. Everything else you should save for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">blog</a>, or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">customer brochure</a>.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>2. Don't create something that won't fit easily into a wallet: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">We know that creating a business card that looks like a pack of matches, or going crazy with the die cutter might seem like a cutting edge way to set your business card apart from the competition. The reality is, if you want your prospective customers to remember to give you a call, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">business card</a> needs to fit easily inside their wallets. During networking events or daily exchanges, you may trade any number of business cards. While quirky or oddly shaped cards may stand out in the moment, those that don't easily fit into your prospects' business folios will likely end up in a pocket (and subsequently the washing machine), at the bottom of a purse, or inside a trash can.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>3. Never use QR codes in business card design: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">There once was a time when marketers like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando marketing agency team</a> tried to socialize QR codes. The idea was a good one. Simply scan the code to reveal promotions or contact information. The reality is, no matter what anyone tells you, this trend has never (and will never) catch on. Save space on your business card and skip the QR code. No one will use it anyway, so you're missing an opportunity to put that same information or promotion on the card. The QR code itself is also distracting and can be a major detraction from your design.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>4. Avoid generic fonts: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">If you have seen and can easily recognize the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/branding/brand-guidelines/"">font</a> on your business card before (think: Comic Sans, Papyrus, or Copperplate) you shouldn't be using it. There are tons of free fonts available for download if you choose to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">create your own business card design</a>, and any good marketing agency has access to paid and free options they can incorporate on your behalf. Using overplayed or highly exposed fonts makes your business card look less professional or may create an unintentionally negative association between your business and another business using the same font. The same goes for generic images in lieu of a customized logo. The small investment in a new font or personalized logo will go a long way in building a lasting, meaningful brand identity that will help customers associate your products and services with your unique value proposition rather than someone else's.</p>

Say what!? Are Facebook messenger ads the next marketing trend?,"The evolution of messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger, SnapChat, and WhatsApp have made the world smaller. It is easier than ever before to chat with people across continents and across time zones... or even just across town.

Messaging apps aren't new. Since the Internet's birth, companies such as AOL have leveraged peoples' desires to connect by creating chat rooms, instant messaging platforms, and virtual interest groups. In today's mobile world, messaging and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">connectivity apps</a> are more important than ever before. And there isn't a one size fits all app.

The polished business professional might choose GoToMeeting to chat with clients, or HipChat to connect with team members. Millennials are flocking to SnapChat to share day-to-day moments on the fly, while international friends and family have turned to Internet-based messengers such as Viber and WhatsApp to avoid hefty international text messaging fees.

Facebook (which also owns WhatsApp) accounts for the largest market share in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">messaging app category</a>. Facebook Messenger Ads or suggested content in WhatsApp represent tremendous untapped potential because the apps are so ""sticky."" Customers keep coming back again and again, and remain logged into the apps almost constantly. This allows marketers to pervasively present content, and hone into their target audience where their customers organically spend time. Because most people, when messaging, are pausing from their daily lives, in-app advertisements also represent a prime time to engage prospects.
<h2><strong>Facebook messenger ads: </strong></h2>
Watch out, marketers! As of this April, Facebook has officially opened up Facebook Messenger ads to publishers. As the program expands, companies like yours will be able to self-publish or partner with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your local Orlando marketing agency</a> to generate content to complement your target audience's Facebook habits. While potential Facebook Messenger ads may not tap into the biggest app population, Facebook has a notoriously loyal user base. As marketing trend-watchers, we anticipate this will be one of the biggest marketing milestones of 2016. It signals that the evolution of advertisements within messaging apps has finally gone mainstream and become acceptable to the broader public (we saw a similar trend when Facebook acquired Instagram and opened up publishing rights earlier this spring).
<h2><strong>SnapChat sponsored snaps: </strong></h2>
Our second most anticipated messaging app to watch is SnapChat. In addition to raw in-app advertisements or personalized messages from brands that promise to entice Facebook sponsored message recipients, SnapChat's hybrid messaging service - which blends text, video, emojis, and photos seamlessly - could take messaging advertisements to the next level. SnapChat lets users interact with celebrities and brands in a highly intimate way as if they are real friends, which makes this content very engaging.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No matter which messaging app you choose to invest in, it's clear that the future of messaging also includes an opportunity to connect and engage with your audience, so don't wait.

The REAL difference between potential vs. actual impressions,"Understanding the difference between actual and potential Twitter impressions can seem confusing to those who don't consider themselves <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">media analytics experts,</a> but don't worry! It's much more simple than you think, and very similar to understanding the difference between <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid advertisements</a> and public relations when assessing the value of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your Orlando marketing agency</a>. To help guide your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">media analytics</a> spend, we have broken down the difference between each category, as well as when, and how to use them.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>What is an actual impression:</strong></h2>
An actual impression is the equivalent of paid media. It represents the actual number of times your tweet (or ad) is seen by your prospective audience. When you send content into the Twitterverse, your actual impressions track the exact number of people who have seen your post. We liken this to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid advertising initiatives</a> because when you buy media, you often know exactly how long your advertisement will run, how many people will see it, and the scope of your campaign. Actual impressions represent that same raw data.
<h2><strong>When and how to use actual impressions: </strong></h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">Tracking your actual impressions</a> can give you a clear understanding of week-over-week or year-over-year growth. It can unlock your ROI based on the number of people who have seen your content versus sales coming in, and is the general foundation of your media analytics dashboard. Actual impressions are a critical KPI that shows how far your content is going.
<h2><strong>What is a potential impression: </strong></h2>
Potential impressions align best with public relations mentions because they represent what ""could"" or ""might"" happen. Potential as a KPI reveals your brand's influence or clout. When a publicist secures a product mention on your favorite blogger's site, there is no guarantee that every single one of the blogger's followers will read the article and notice your product placement, but the potential is there. Similarly, if a celebrity or tastemaker shares your posts, your content's potential to influence new prospects has increased exponentially based on their pool of followers.
<h2><strong>When and how to use potential impressions: </strong></h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">Tracking potential impressions</a> is critical if you are partnering with other brands, engaging with other accounts, and encouraging the viral spread of your content. The impact is a little less straightforward than actual impressions because the figure represents total potential views, rather than what has historically taken place.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">media analytics</a> expert will tell you that tracking both actual and potential impressions blends nicely; depending on the type of campaigns you're running and the information you want to learn about your customers. Our team can help you <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing/"">dig into</a> which is right for your brand and tailor a campaign around your needs.</p>",,6/30/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Potential-vs.-Actual.jpg,potential-vs-actual-impressions,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
4 steps to creating brand guidelines every startup should follow,"Crafting your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand identity guidelines</a> can seem daunting, especially as a startup. Once you have your name and logo created, it's important (and even fun) to build a brand guide for your team. Brand identity guidelines can help create a cohesive energy among your employees and guide your creative energy. The trick is not to get bogged down in the details as you're still building your brand, while providing enough guidance for your team to work and make branding decisions independently.

Refreshing or expanding brand identity guidelines as a large, established organization is different than starting with a clean slate. As a startup, you have the opportunity to get it right the first time, break the rules, and let your vision shine. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Click here</a> for examples of how our Orlando marketing agency has helped other companies build out their brand, or follow these four unbeatable steps to start creating your brand identity.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1. Start small when building your first brand identity guidelines:</strong></h2>
When people think about brand guidelines, they often think of a large, polished document worthy of your urban-chic apartment's coffee table. But that doesn't always need to be the case. Start with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">color variations</a>, font choices, and basic placement instructions. For a seasoned designer, mapping out these details should be no sweat. Kick things off by hosting a brainstorming session with your key stakeholders, decision makers, and design team. Bring examples of what you like, make a ""dream board,"" or do a little free form drawing as you discuss. Your designer should be able to create the basics based on this discussion. From there, you can begin adding elements and refining. As long as these four elements are in place, you can add more details as you go. And we fully support a coffee table book as the 2.0 version of your own brand identity guidelines, by the way.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. Tie in imagery and symbols that resonate with your products or services:</strong></h2>
Don't be afraid to layer images and symbols that resonate with your brand into your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">brand identity guidelines</a>. Even if they aren't part of your logo or copyrighted photos, having inspirational imagery that captures your brand's tone and vibe can help frame the ""why"" behind certain design elements, so other employees see their value. Images are also a powerful way to translate ideas without relying on huge blocks of copy. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Including images in your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">brand identity guidelines</a> can be a visual reminder of your products, forge positive brand associations between your organization and a place or an object, or clarify the look and feel of everything from your office to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">your packaging</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a>.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. Make your brand identity guidelines user-friendly for non-designers too:</strong></h2>
When your designer or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando marketing agency</a> creates your brand identity guidelines, they will include a variety of design specs so other designers and developers can use your brand guide when creating advertisements or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">tweaking the website</a>. In addition to these valuable details - which often include specific color codes, font styles or typography, photo cropping and filtering instructions, etc. - having non-design-related elements can be an illuminating addition to your guidelines. Sharing your brand identity guidelines with non-designers is a good way to align the team, so consider including a few stylized quotes, your mission statement, or other images and verbiage that translates your core design elements for the average employee. You should never add ""extras"" in lieu of your design specs, but your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">style guide</a> should also make as much sense to designers as it does to your accounting team.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">4. Include any ""do"" AND ""don't"" recommendations:</strong></h2>
What designers and employees do with your brand elements is often as important as what they <em>don't</em> do. Don't shy away from including a ""don't"" here and there in your brand identity guidelines. For example, if your logo features a square form, you may not want your employees to superimpose other images on top of or into the square. Your colors may be interchangeable sometimes, but sometimes they may not. Get clear on what you can and can't do to avoid unnecessary editing. Naturally, you never know what you don't know. Some of your guidelines will evolve based on trial and error, but if you already know there are a few deal breakers, get them out of the way up front.

The important thing is to start creating. Get something down on a page and let the rest flow naturally. Crafting identity guidelines are a key part of the brand evolution, so let the experience grow with you and your organization rather than waiting until your brand has taken on a life of its own.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative/"">Our team specializes</a> in brand creation and refinement, so we're here to help if you get stuck or need a little inspiration.

Tis the season... Or is it? How does seasonality impact your brand,"Depending on the type of industry you're in, market seasonality can feel like a blessing or a curse. For hotel owners and hospitality leaders, seasonal winter slumps can force hotels to deeply discount their room rates and lead customers to expect lower prices year round. On the flip side, many consumer packaged goods and retail giants rely on the annual influx of sales around Black Friday and look forward to the revenue they'll drive during holiday discounts.

The reality is: <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">market seasonality</a> exists in almost every industry as people tend to shop and engage with service provides based on their own life cycles. Children's school calendars, vacation schedules, and holidays all dictate how business flows across almost every industry. To help you unlock the potential of market seasonality, we've unpacked a few basics to get you started.
<h2><strong>What is market seasonality? </strong></h2>
If you aren't familiar with market seasonality, you may simply be so accustomed to seeing it in action that you don't even realize it's there. When you review your bottom line revenue or other KPIs, chances are that you consider both <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">month-over-month and year-over-year metrics</a>. The reason being is that certain months are expected to perform better than others. That monthly - or seasonal - variation is, you guessed it, market seasonality. If you were a ski resort, you would naturally expect to see a dip in bookings moving from February into March and April. However, if you saw a dramatic decline when comparing this February to last February, that may be cause for concern. Understanding market seasonality starts with understanding your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">target audience</a> and when they are most likely to need (or want) your products. Market seasonality is simply a reflection of when your customers are most willing to buy your product or engage with your services based on external factors that have nothing to do with your brand, such as travel or weather.
<h2><strong>Can market seasonality be a good thing? </strong></h2>
Of <em>course</em> market seasonality can be a good thing! In fact, it can be a great thing when you partner with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">savvy local marketing agency</a> or leverage a few creative promotions during your on and off seasons. While it would be great if sales were consistent year round, they never will be. You can't change the game, but you can play to win. Consider where you see natural peaks and valleys in sales and revenue and consider what you could do to use these dips to your advantage. For example, many clothing companies offer discounts on winter clothing at the start of spring, around the same time they introduce their warm weather lines. Talk about a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">win-win situation</a>. These brands get a boost in purchases thanks to their promos, without compromising sales from their new product releases. In these instances, market seasonality can actually drive more sales than a company might have expected otherwise. Similarly, service providers also use slower summer months or harsh winter ""hibernation periods"" to host new customer events and participate in speaking engagements to build their brand and increase exposure.
<h2><strong>Planning for market seasonality:</strong></h2>
The trick is to<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/""> plan for market seasonality in advance</a>. If you wait until a slump hits to kickstart a promotion and make up lost revenue, your brand may not be able to close the gap as effectively as you'd like. Instead, consider your natural sales cycle and front load a few opportunities into your marketing calendar throughout the year. For example, if you're a subscription-based educational software company, your most important revenue generating months are at the beginning of the fiscal year (so your accounts have a chance to mature and generate revenue throughout the entire year). Knowing this, you'd want to load a few promotions into Q1 and Q2 to set yourself up for success moving through the middle of the year and into the slower summer months when potential customers may be traveling and less inclined to buy. Sounds simple, right?

The $65 Billion Question: How To Win With Millennials,"Would your company like a piece of the $65 billion market that is millennial shoppers? We thought so. Whether you're offering a luxury product, consumer packaged goods and staples, or a service, millennials are one of the most sought after demographics since the baby boomers made their fortunes. These emerging shoppers represent some of the most diverse and flexible consumers our market has ever seen (with a disposable income to boot), making them highly desirable for marketers.

Everyone is asking how to engage this audience, leveraging new technology to capture their attention, and forging new marketing frontiers to try to attract and keep these young trend setters. We don't claim to have all the answers, but we do have a few answers to some common questions about how to win with Millennials. Here's how.
<h2><strong>Q: Are millennials penny wise, and dollar foolish? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>A: In a nutshell: yes. </strong></h2>
With millions of dollars in student loan debt, skyrocketing rent and homeowner prices, and inflated costs of living in many cities, most Millennials try to cut costs wherever they can without sacrificing their Instagram-worthy exteriors. About 60% of millennials claim they are as comfortable <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">buying non-name brand items</a> as they are splurging for brands they love. One layer deeper, we learn that millennials are most likely to buy off brand items on everyday goods such as paper towels or butter, but are more inclined to align themselves with big brands on visible investments such as their cars or clothing. In other words, millennials are inclined to save their pennies when they can, but invest in items that will either bring them status, align with lifestyle values they champion on an individual level, or that they believe will serve them for years to come. Knowing where your brand falls on millennials' perceived value spectrum will help inform your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">product pricing and placement strategy</a>. If you know your brand can't deliver a feel-good high like Tom's (a brand that donates a pair of shoes to children in need every time someone purchase one), consider how to compete in a price sensitive market rather than trying to sell value where it doesn't exist. On the other hand ... it may be time to consider what the next two-for-one charity craze might be.
<h2><strong>Q: Are brick and mortar stores becoming obsolete? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>A: Not remotely. </strong></h2>
It's true. 92% of millennials say they will purchase something online or on a mobile device this year. Online shopping is quick, convenient, and sometimes cheaper than shopping local or visiting the mall. But that doesn't change that many stores still draw in as much revenue online as they do offline. For millennials, online shopping versus retail shopping isn't an ""either / or"" ... it's an ""and."" Shopping is a social activity for millennials, so if you do plan to invest in marketing efforts at your retail locations, consider that your target audience is probably shopping with other people. Leverage the social aspect of brick and mortar stores by introducing ""share your discount"" offers for groups shopping together, social media discounts for check-in's, or on-site shopping events (a little champagne never hurt anyone). Similarly, because online shopping is usually done from the privacy of your millennials' homes, consider how personalized emails and individualized discounts can drive sales online.
<h2><strong>Q: Are millennials really as narcissistic as we've heard?</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>A: That depends who you ask. </strong></h2>
Millennials are more inclined than any other generation to give their time and money. They love brands that are environmentally conscious and have a positive impact on the global community. They also happen to be the most demanding when it comes to ""wanting it all."" They want to work remotely, they don't want to join the work force right away, and they tend to delay a lot of the adult responsibilities older generations value. Does that make them more narcissistic than other generations? It's hard to say. But they are image conscious. And one thing is certain: they are redefining the rules of marketing and brand engagement. They are fiercely loyal, so if they do align to a brand, it's because it speaks to them on a personal level. And once they do, they will share it and wear it loud and proud. When trying to win with millennials, consider that fact.

"Engagement, impressions, and social media analytics, oh my.","Go ahead, #AMA about impressions and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">social media analytics</a>: we have the skinny on the ROI of your KPIs, and we're not even newsjacking or clickbaiting your RSS feed to tell you about it. We know, we know, the social media jargon can get a little overwhelming (some might even say annoying). Instead of embracing the wealth of information we have about our customers, we sometimes shy away from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">media analytics</a> because it's easy to get confused or misled by the myriad of abbreviations and trendy marketing terms associated with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">data analysis</a>. But any good marketer will tell you that we don't need code words to make our data more glamorous because it's one of the most powerful and sexy <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/5-digital-marketing-tools-will-help-small-businesses-succeed/"">marketing tools</a> we have in our arsenal.
<h2>Social media analytics KPI's</h2>
To help you feel more comfortable telling the difference between everything from engagement to impressions and social media analytics, we're breaking down the top three key performance indicators (KPI's) and analytics terms you need to know as a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/12-steps-to-social-media-marketing-success-infographic/"">social media marketer</a>.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Understanding reach: </strong></h2>
Your brand's reach is one of the most simple, straightforward media analytics metrics to capture. It represents your network or the total audience your brand interacts with. Reach is made up of your followers, users, and subscribers. When analysts talk about reach, they often use it as a proxy for how recognizable your brand is, how popular your company is within the marketplace, or how likely customers are to switch to (and stay with) your brand compared to your competitors because reach represents how loyal and proud customers are to follow and interact with your brand.
<h2><strong>Not to be confused with impressions:</strong></h2>
Unfortunately, people often confuse reach with impressions. If reach represents your self-identified audience as a whole, your impressions represent the actual number of times a single piece of content (a post, tweet, or picture) is seen by users. Impressions aren't always limited to your audience - or reach - because additional impressions occur through sharing, digital ads, or promoted content. The number of impressions, or times your content is seen, is often used to help calculate the return on investment (ROI) of a certain campaign or marketing initiative. For a deep dive into impressions, click here to read our blog on actual versus potential impressions.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>But none of it matters without engagement: </strong></h2>
Your brand might have an incredible reach, and your posts might be getting thousands of impressions, but if your engagement metric is low, chances are your content isn't working. Engagement describes how often your viewers interact with your content via likes, shares, comments, tweets, or reposts. It tells you how relevant your posts are to your viewers and helps you discover what they enjoy reading or seeing in their newsfeeds. The more people that interact with your posts, the greater their engagement is. This is one of the most important <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">social media analytics</a> metrics because it reveals whether your social media is breaking through the clutter and reaching your target audience in a meaningful way or just getting lost in the sea of posts.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now that you understand the basics, you should feel more confident digging into your data to understand what your customers need from you to trust and interact with your brand on the internet. Social media marketing is one of the most powerful and ubiquitous marketing channels and <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">we're here to help</a> you use it to its fullest potential.</p>",,7/14/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Social-Media-Jargon.jpg,social-media-analytics-engagement,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
Three brand designs for health no matter what industry you're in,"Building a healthy brand starts with bringing together a clear vision and product that fits your customers' lifestyles. Today, customers are more interested than ever in how products contribute to their overall health and wellness, or the improvement of the world around them, which is why building a robust brand starts with designs for health inside the office and out. Everyone from fast food chains (now offering healthy menu options) to consumer goods (like TOMS<b>® </b>One for One model) is embracing the idea that consumers prefer to engage with brands that are improving the collective community in a meaningful way. No matter what industry you're in or what products and services you offer, you have the opportunity to leverage <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign designs</a> for health that showcase how your company is making a difference in your customers' lives.

To highlight how your products contribute to a healthier lifestyle or community effort, we have compiled a list of three brand design guidelines to get you started.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1. Check in with your brand promise:</strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">One of the easiest ways to promote goodwill is to ensure your brand promise clearly expresses what customers will get - or be able to give - by choosing your products. For example, organic grocery store Trader Joe's has outpaced mega competitors such as Whole Foods and Fresh Market thanks to its private label's earnest brand promise: ""Trader Joe's private label products promise great quality fare for exceptional, everyday prices. We taste everything before we put our name on it and offer only what we feel is extraordinary."" Customers feel confident purchasing Trader Joe's products because they receive great quality, healthy products for a price that fits their lifestyle. Check in with your own brand promise and ask yourself if it expresses a clear value proposition to your customers that will make them feel good investing - or even indulging - in your brand.</span><strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. Visual housekeeping and designs for health: </strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">If you already know your brand delivers exceptional service or quality, make sure your visual elements reflect that same level of confidence. In this instance, we literally mean ensuring your team designs for health. Choose colors, fonts, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">UX layouts</a>, and images that capture the essence of what's best about your brand. For example, when most people think about the insurance industry, they may not immediately think of healthy lifestyle or community involvement, but corporate giant Nationwide Insurance nails the important brand balancing act between commerce and community. In addition to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">ad campaigns</a> that highlight how their services give customers peace of mind and financial security, the corporation routinely showcases their work funding the Nationwide Children's Hospital and their commitment to corporate responsibility. Each of their brand campaigns - whether it's via media, digital, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email</a>, or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print</a> - use visual designs that highlight, link, and reaffirm these efforts. Their emphasis on simple, clean creative elements and straightforward messaging creates consistent alignment with their brand promise and visual assets. These visual reminders help your customers understand that their purchases are contributing to something beyond themselves and deepens their brand loyalty.</span>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. Create four campaign designs for health: </strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Put these principles into action by committing to four campaign designs for health this year because there is nothing more important when building or refining a brand than consistency. Every marketing initiative your team invests in won't necessarily promote a sense of health or wellbeing, but one health- or community-focused effort each quarter creates a consistent reminder that will forge a link between your brand and your customers' lifestyles. When these campaigns are reinforced by your typical, day-to-day visual and marketing elements, this link becomes stronger and more substantial. Over time, customers will begin associating your brand style guidelines with your products and the positive impact they have on their communities and lives. Great examples of this continuous affirmation are Coca-Cola's holiday campaigns. Each year, Coke spends time around the holidays highlighting their product's ability to build communities, bring people together, and spread joy. These feel-good, community campaigns echo the ads and efforts they run year round, with extra emphasis on how Coke makes the world healthier and happier. Even when those ads aren't running, customers feel the positive effects of this positive brand association.</span>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There are many ways for your brand to promote designs for health, forge links between your community and your products, or emphasize how your products stand out from the competition. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Let us help you</a> brainstorm ways to highlight these links as you plan for the second half of the year and kick off the new year with customers that are engaged, healthy, happy, and committed to your brand.</p>

5 ways to see the future using predictive analytics,"<p class=""Body"">You don't need to be clairvoyant to see the future. By harnessing your customer data and predictive analytics, you have all the tools you need right in front of you. The good news is, you don't need to be a statistician or regression analyst to use predictive analytics either. With the help of your team, a few simple metric tools, or your local <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando marketing agency</a>, you can predict hundreds of business outcomes and behaviors that will inform your marketing efforts, so you and your team can work smarter, not harder.</p>
<p class=""Body"">With so many options to choose from, it can be difficult to narrow down the key metrics you want to predict. To begin, take a look at your sales or <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/conversion-marketing-matrix/"">conversion funnel</a>. Most industries have benchmarks for each step of the funnel. By comparing your demand generation movement, sign up rates, conversion rates, and retention rates to those averages, you can see where you're doing well and where you could use some help.</p>
<p class=""Body"">This quick needs assessment will help you focus your efforts and decide which data to hone in on first. As a rule, the following five metrics are a great place to start no matter how your business is performing.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>1. Predictive analytics and customer lifetime value</b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Using the data from your conversion or sales rate and retention rate, you can predict the average lifespan, and thus the lifetime monetary value, of each customer or sale. As you invest in campaigns that turn prospects into customers, you can balance that return on investment (ROI) against what you predict those <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value"">customers' lifetime value </a>will be. If you're spending tons of money to acquire new customers, but their expected lifetime value is below that figure, it's time to take a new approach.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>2. Churn, funnel efficiency, and cart abandonment</b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Although we often try to optimize for our sales, sometimes it is just as effective to optimize around our losses. If you can predict the risk of your customers defecting to your competition or leaving your site before they complete the sale, you can plan to close that gap through other initiatives. Your churn rate, funnel efficiency, and cart abandonment are all easily forecasted using simple <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">analytics</a> tools such as Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics and will help you understand what types of retention or conversion initiatives will be most profitable.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>3. Purchase intent</b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">In that vein, you can close your anticipated business gaps by predicting who will buy your product and who won't. Using behavioral cues that signal the seriousness of a shopper will help you spend more time, energy, and resources on customers who are more likely to convert. For example, if your company offers a free trial for business software, try <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">targeted marketing campaigns</a> aimed at those who signed up with a business email address rather than those who signed up with a personal or ""junk"" address. By using predictive analytics to determine what behaviors correlate with purchases, you can aim your marketing efforts accordingly.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>4. Getting pricing right: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">Predictive analytics</a> can also reveal pricing trends or price elasticity, which is one of the most important keys to success. Combining big data market behavior with your customers' reaction to various promotions can help you tweak your pricing to maximize gains throughout the year so that you aren't leaving money on the table.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>5. Internal forecasting: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Last, but certainly not least, you can also use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">predictive analytics</a> to help set your annual business goals. By forecasting demand, your revenue run rate, and periods of growth, you can prepare for and strive toward measurable outcomes that will catapult your company forward. This type of forecasting also helps you understand if your goals are too high or too low so your team understands the impact of their work.</p>
<p class=""Body"" style=""text-align: center;"">See, we told you that you could see the future. Big data is the future ... and so are the insights it provides.</p>",,7/15/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Predictive-Analytics.jpg,predictive-analytics-see-future,publish,,Bottom,0,open,3
5 quick trends CPG brands must embrace to win with millennials,"If you aren't sick of hearing about why you need to invest in millennials yet, you probably haven't been paying close enough attention to their forecasted purchasing potential. Millennials are a unique generation with an emerging purchasing power unlike any generation we've seen to date. Their eclectic spending habits make them highly desirable and somewhat elusive. Often cited as ""penny wise and dollar foolish,"" (see our recent post about some of the biggest myths surrounding millennials <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/win-millennials/"">here</a>) CPG brands sometimes have a hard time breaking through the clutter to connect with these brand-loyal consumers.

If your brand happens to be lucky enough to resonate with millennials already, you know how fiercely loyal they can be. If you're a new market entrant or emerging company, however, catching millennials' attention (and keeping it long enough to make a sale) can be a hurdle. Don't waste another minute. These five quick and easy marketing trends will help you win with millennials and score for years to come.
<h2><strong>1. Don't try to win with price: </strong></h2>
Go ahead, throw out the coveted ""Marketing Four P's"" you learned in B-School. As a consumer packaged goods brand, you're never going to win through price with millennials. Unless you happen to be at the very bottom end of the pricing scale, your best bet is to distinguish yourself by adding unique value or meaning to your products. Millennials will shop for a bargain on goods and sundry items, such as CPGs, but often make an exception for brands that go above and beyond their expectations. Additionally, millennials are one of the least likely demographics to switch brands once they have found a product they like, even when that brand is out priced by competition. Colgate discovered that they could actually increase their prices above competition because millennials were so connected with their unique lifestyle messaging that other toothpaste labels simply didn't stand a chance. And of course, prices are always going to fluctuate, which is why it's<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/""> smarter to invest in what makes your product special</a>.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. Do something that matters: </strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Never think of your brand as ""just another CPG."" Even the most mundane products can appeal to millennials when they connect with something larger than the product itself. Millennials often invest in products that are aligned with global issues or lifestyle causes they believe in. For example, the (RED) HIV/AIDS <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">awareness campaign</a>, which often lends its stamp of approval to CPG products willing to donate a portion of their profits to the cause, has generated wild success for everything from personal speakers, to food products, and clothing brands simply because it augments the product within the global community.</span><strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. Invest in digital marketing: </strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">If you're going to attract millennials, you also need to sell your products where and how they want to shop. Although consumer packaged goods were often considered a brick and mortar staple, the emergence of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce</a> giants such as Amazon have changed how millennials shop. Thanks to services like Amazon Pantry and home-grocery store delivery, these savvy shoppers often save time and money by purchasing CPGs online and having them delivered. To ensure your products don't get overlooked during their next shopping spree, take time to invest in digital ads and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media</a> that will keep your products top of mind and encourage millennials to go out of their way to purchase your items.</span><strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">4. Don't be afraid to buddy up: </strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">CPG brands can supercharge their image with a boost of edginess, allure, or excitement simply by partnering with endorsers or unrelated brands that already enjoy that reputation. For example, when Redbull partnered with the X-Games (a millennial favorite), they immediately shifted their market from overworked corporate travelers, to adrenaline-junkies and adventure seeking ""Gen Y-ers."" Even if your CPG can't generate (or sell) a certain emotion on its own, chances are, partnering with another organization could. Choose wisely when trying to attract millennials, however, to avoid unintentionally negative brand association with elitist or non-environmentally sound partners that will immediately turn off this audience. </span>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">5. Make your packaging an extension of your brand: </strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">If all else fails, learn from a CPG giant: Apple. Ensure your packaging is an extension of your brand values. Whether you want to attract millennials with quality or a certain emotional vibe, your packaging is your first opportunity to communicate who you are. Apple's clean, high-quality packaging mirrors its products in many ways and is often photographed and shared on social media as an exciting addition to the product experience. Custom packaging may be a little more expensive, but it's an opportunity no company can afford to waste.</span>

Consumer packaged goods... You mean content packaged goods,"Consumer packaged goods are leading the charge in millennial marketing initiatives. Although as marketers, we wouldn't be surprised to hear luxury or lifestyle brands, such as the LVMH collection or Mercedes-Benz were pioneering, experimenting with, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">testing new marketing tactics</a>; we were delighted to learn that CPGs were making bold strides in these same efforts. Consumer packaged goods are leading the way on some of the most innovative marketing trends of 2016. Here's why:
<h2><strong>They aren't afraid of experiential marketing: </strong></h2>
CPGs are often competing in mature or saturated markets, so they are more willing to take a big swing and learn quickly during times of fierce competition. Within the last decade, experiential marketing has become a new - somewhat experimental - marketing tactic to attract CPG consumers. Companies such as Redbull have used experiential marketing events to bolster their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand image</a>, in this case, with adventure and energy. Event marketing transports potential customers into an alternate version of their lifestyle in which their products have transformed their day-to-day lives. Even when these events or guerrilla marketing experiences are an exaggerated version of their products' value proposition, the emotions participants feel during these events last longer than any traditional advertisement ever could. This type of marketing is especially effective for new product launches or brand refreshing efforts.
<h2><strong>They have nailed the art of storytelling: </strong></h2>
No one <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">tells a story</a> better than Oreo. In their latest advertising campaigns, Oreo shows how sharing their time-honored cookie brings families and individuals closer together. Watching a little boy share an Oreo before bedtime with his father, who has video conferenced into his son's bedroom before his morning meeting half way across the globe in Hong Kong, transforms the simple pleasure of eating a cookie into a family tradition. Brands such as Coca-Cola have taken a similar approach to elevate feelings of goodwill around the holidays, while the laundry detergent brand Tide captures the relief of simplifying everyday life amidst the chaos of children, pets, multiple schedules, and ubiquitous stains. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">Storytelling</a> is a powerful tool when used in traditional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">advertising campaigns</a> and shareable <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">content on social media</a> because it allows consumers to think about CPGs in a new way.
<h2><strong>Celebrity sponsorship is not a dirty word: </strong></h2>
CPGs have also benefitted tremendously with millennials by seeking celebrity endorsements. Although there is no illusion that these brand partnerships are organic, CPGs have learned (and leveraged) the power of our youngest generation's fixation on celebrity lifestyles. Cindy Crawford may have started it with her Pepsi endorsement in the 80's, but every time a celebrity stands next to a CPG, sales increase approximately 20%—yes, even with a B-list name. It may sound counterintuitive to today's modern marketers who are used to bending over backwards to build brand trust, but we already told you that consumer packaged goods were daring to be different.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It may not always make sense, but we know these companies aren't spending millions of dollars for a few seconds during the Super Bowl halftime for nothing. If you want to think outside the box (literally), CPGs are a great place to seek new ideas and marketing trends you may not have considered before. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> of marketing enthusiasts have a few tricks up our sleeves that we learned from watching the best of the best CPG brands. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blogs/"">Click here</a> for a few more tips.</p>",,8/1/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Consumer-Packaged-Goods-1.jpg,consumer-packaged-goods,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How to make a logo that's worth $211 million for your brand,"When thinking about how to make a logo that actually works, one of the most obvious answers is to take notes from the pros. The most expensive logo created in the last decade was gasoline giant British Petroleum's - also known as BPs - logo refresh in 2008. The company partnered with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing agency</a> (read: paid them $211 million) to create a new logo in a highly saturated, mature market. The goal was to design something that symbolized the potential of gasoline, BP's emphasis on green technology, and that helped them stand out from their major competitors such as Exxon and Chevron. The results transformed BP's traditional green and yellow shield into a starburst, with an updated modern font. Seems simple, right? So why was this fresh design worth $211 million, and how can you make a logo that charges your brand with the same effect? We're glad you asked.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>WHY ARE LOGOS WORTH SO MUCH TO YOUR ORGANIZATION? </strong></h2>
BP isn't the only company that has invested heavily in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo design</a>. Up and coming organizations or companies trying to refresh their image, such as Pepsi or Accenture, have been known to spend over a million dollars on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo designs</a> as well. Yet, some of the most well known logos, such as Google and Twitter, were designed for less than $15. So, do you need to spend a million to make a million from your logo? We're going to let you in on a secret: the answer is no. Highly recognizable companies such as Coca-Cola and Nike went through the same logo design process that we recommend to our clients, and now include their logos on their accounting financial statements as ""goodwill"" assets that are routinely represented in the billions - that's a b - of dollars because they are so valuable.

The trick is realizing that it isn't how much you spend on a logo, but how effective it is and how well it <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">complements your brand</a>, that makes a logo valuable. Logos are, quite literally, the face of your company, so they become your most valuable hook when catching your customers' eyes. BP, Coca-Cola, Google, and Twitter all have easily identifiable logos -- so recognizable, in fact, that many consumers can identify these brands with simply their colors alone. If you ask your local Orlando marketing agency representatives how to design a logo that is worth millions, the answer is simply to make sure it's something people will remember. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">Logos</a> become an asset to your brand when they trigger continuous, top of mind cognizance about your product or are so recognizable in your category that your customers always think of you before your competition.
<h2><strong>HOW TO MAKE A LOGO THAT WORKS FOR YOUR BRAND? </strong></h2>
There is no exact ""How to Make a Logo That Works"" guide (although we wish there was), but there are a few tried and tested rules that can guide your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo design</a> toward success. Taking a page out of Google's playbook: <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo creation</a> doesn't need to be expensive, but it does need to be effective, which is why we recommend partnering with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">a local Orlando marketing agency</a> to craft something that will speak to your target audience and adhere to design best practices.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1. Avoid cliches:</strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">We know it can be tempting to use that ultra trendy free font you keep seeing around town, or purchase stock images from the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">web</a> for your logo because they're ""in"" right now, but don't. Choose a symbol, an image, or font type that is uniquely you. If you are able to find the main image for your logo on Google, your customers will be able to find it too. Certain imagery - such as the infinity symbol, foliage, clasped hands, and globes - may seem like they speak to your brand in a meaningful way, but are so common and overused in the general marketplace that your logo has no chance of hitting that $211 million mark.</span>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. Typography can be a logo:</strong></h2>
Also realize that sometimes a picture <em>isn't </em>worth a thousand words. We don't say this often, but you don't always need an image for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo</a>. Custom fonts and artistic lettering can be a logo in and of itself. If you're unsure how to make a logo that will resonate with your customers, the best place to start is often <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">your company name</a>. Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">local Orlando marketing agency</a> can help mock up a variety of lettering treatments that capture the tone and vibe of your brand. A clean, text-based logo will help your customers focus on who you are or the services you offer without leaning on cliche images or rolling the dice with abstract artwork a la Nike's signature swoosh.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. Keep it simple: </strong></h2>
<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The most important thing you can do when creating a logo is to keep it simple. Once you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">create a design</a>, do the ""three second test."" Show your logo to a few friends or colleagues for three seconds, then ask them what they remember about the logo and how it makes them feel. If your logo is too complicated, they may have trouble answering that question clearly, so use their responses to guide any tweaks, simplification, or updates to your design. Color, type face, and images all play a part in crafting the perfect first impression, so don't be afraid to try a few variations until you discover what works.</span>

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No matter what image or font you choose to represent your company, your logo should be something you love. Remember, your logo often serves as the cornerstone of your brand and can be the starting point for your brand and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">design guidelines</a> or creative expression. It is a jumping off point for your other marketing initiatives, so don't rush this critical part of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand building process</a>.

Multi-sensory marketing takes CPGs by your senses,"Consumer packaged goods marketing often experiments with the most innovative techniques and exposes brands to a breadth of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaigns touching multiple channels</a> because they are attempting to reach a wide audience. As a result, CPGs have generated tons of data on the types of campaigns that work and don't work. One of our favorite emerging trends is multi-sensory advertisements.

Made popular by Oxford University's Dr. Charles Spence, multi-sensory marketing suggests that customers will be swayed to taste, feel, smell, or see CPGs a certain way by pairing sensory triggers that support the emotion a product is trying to inspire. During a coffee symposium, Spence shows how the mind can be misled to believe coffee tastes better (or worse) by changing its packaging, presentation in a coffee shop, adding smells, or different colors. Don't believe us? Just watch: <a href=""https://youtu.be/vVKabsudi1I"">https://youtu.be/vVKabsudi1I</a>

Amazing stuff, right? Multi-sensory advertising is especially popular with millennial marketing experts because these campaigns break through the clutter and create a stronger <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">emotional bond with the brand</a> than traditional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print</a> or television ads. This is a ""must-do"" when marketing to millennials because the single most important factor in attracting this audience is creating a real, emotional connection with your brand.

Below, we share some of our favorite multi-sensory CPG campaigns and why they are so successful. We're excited to help you create your next (or first) multi-sensory campaign, so <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">click here</a> to discover how we have worked with brands like yours in the past or set up a one-on-one consultation today at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your local Orlando marketing agency</a>.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>CPG MARKETING MEETS TASTE: </strong></h2>
What do Kit Kat bars and Pringles have in common? Aside from being delicious - if somewhat indulgent - snacks, both CPG brands have discovered that consumers associate freshness with the sound of a crisp crunch. In a study sponsored by Dr. Spence, Pringles played the sound of different chips crunching to their consumers. Based on how fresh or stale the chips sounded influenced the consumers' opinion of how the chips would taste. Leveraging that information, Pringles has never shied away from showing sound bites of happy customers munching in their television spots, and routinely reinforce this messaging with their ""once you pop, you can't stop"" tag line. Everything from the sound of opening a Pringles tube, to the chips rattling inside the canister affirms the crisp freshness of the chips. Similarly, Kit Kat has built hundreds of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaigns</a> around the crunch and snap of sharing and eating a Kit Kat bar. Their ads show customers being transported outside their mundane day-to-day lives as the crunch takes over. In other ads, the entire commercial leverages the various signature sounds of breaking into or biting a Kit Kat bar. The crunch, in this instance, is a pleasurable sensory experience customers have come to expect and crave. It was just a matter of discovering which this sensory experience delighted customers.
<h2><strong>CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS THAT SMELL ... WELL ... GOOD: </strong></h2>
Sure, scratch and sniff coffee bags and air freshener <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaging</a> seems like an obvious use of the sense of smell to make a sale, but one of our favorite examples of multi-sensory marketing doesn't rely on smell to make the sale ... It changes the smell of the product itself. In blind tests, Axe Body Spray discovered that it's masculine cologne had great potential, but found that consumers thought the spray was less masculine if they heard the traditional swoosh of a perfume atomizer before smelling the product. To counter balance this unintentional multi-sensory fail, Axe Body Spray changed their packaging so the bottle's nozzle created a more aggressive, ""manly"" sound when using the product. That simple commercial innovation boosted customers perception of the smell and appreciation for the product. Talk about taking your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaging</a> seriously. Using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">focus groups</a> or setting up user testing can help reveal insights like this that can make or break how your CPG is perceived.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>SEEING IS BELIEVING FOR MILLENNIAL MARKETING: </strong></h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">Packaging</a> and presentation is one of the most powerful tools when crafting a multi-sensory marketing campaign targeted at the millennial audience. Because millennials are used to consuming information via photos and rely on visual cues as they move from device to device, colors and packaging can have a profound subliminal effect on how they perceive CPGs in the real world. Color alone is enough to trigger a certain sentiment or influence taste. Just ask Coca-Cola. As part of their holiday collection, Coke released a limited edition white can featuring polar bears frolicking in the snow. Although they had not changed the product itself, hundreds of customers called in complaining that the drink formula had changed and that the product did not taste as good. Simply switching back to the traditional red can solved the sales issue. If you are marketing to a millennial audience, consider what they are looking at every day and how you could use those natural triggers to align your product with a certain feeling or effect.
<h2><strong>THE RIGHT TOUCH FOR CPGs: </strong></h2>
The challenge with CPGs is that they are usually packed in such a way that customers don't have the opportunity to feel, touch, or play with the product until after they have purchased it. Two companies have solved this problem in unique ways that we love. Electronic retailer Apple has created entire stores dedicated to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">touching and feeling their products</a>. In their store kiosks, customers can play with, try on, weigh, and admire each and every product Apple sells. This high-sensory experience affirms Apple's commitment to quality and design and sets them apart from other electronic manufacturers. On the other end of the spectrum, organic soap company LUSH, has taken a similar approach by setting up ""mini spas"" in several of their key stores across the United States. Customers can come in and enjoy quick in-store treatments using their hand lotion, soap and scrubs right to discover the benefits of these luxurious, eco-friendly products. Touch is especially important for CPGs trying to establish themselves based on value rather than price and can be a powerful reminder of quality.
<h2><strong>HEAR THE DIFFERENCE WITH MULTI-SENSORY MARKETING:</strong></h2>
No one does multi-sensory marketing better than Bose headphones and speakers. In almost any major electronic store or boutique where Bose is sold, customers will find a station outfitted with surround sound speakers or noise canceling headphone. Customers are invited to hear the sound of a Porsche revving, a majestic waterfall rushing, or immerse themselves in an action-packed movie. In each of these examples, Bose pairs their listening booth with high-adrenaline experiences rather than simply letting the customer flip on the news or turn to their Smartphone for musical inspiration. choice Their of sounds - all of which may seem otherworldly to the average consumer - affirms that Bose itself is in a class of its own in line with luxury brands such as Porsche or some of the greatest wonders that the world (or Hollywood) can deliver.
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If those examples don't inspire you to try something new, nothing will. Sometimes, the unconventional answer is the right one. And sure, you've heard us share our excitement about digital marketing before, but these CPGs have learned to balance the digital wave with innovative, multi-sensory techniques. These marketing leaders prove that there isn't a one size fits all model when appealing to customers. Learn about our <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/agency/#our-services"">marketing approach here</a>.</p>",,7/28/2016 8:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Multi-Sensory-Marketing-Takes-CPGs.jpg,multi-sensory-marketing-takes-cpgs,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Using user generated content: Let your customers do your work,"Advertising evolved from informational sales tactics into carefully curated product representations and experiences in the 40's and 50's. Marketing executives a la Mad Men's Don Draper worked with clients to capture their client's essence and package it into a perfectly polished <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a>. Ads could bend the truth in small doses to create a magical version of reality in which Dawn dish soap has the power to transform the average housewife into a beautiful domestic goddess.

Times have changed. Today, customers have wised up to the alluring temptation of this type of advertising. Instead of looking to their favorite magazine for inspiration on what to buy, they ask their friends or surf their favorite bloggers' websites. As a result, the emergence of review sites, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, and peer-sharing has boomed. Now, customers have the power to influence a brand's success simply by telling the truth. We'd like to think Don Draper needs a martini just thinking about that prospect.

Luckily, we know you understand the value of harnessing your customers feedback as part of a healthy marketing mix. User generated content is one of the simple, most effective ways to channel positive customer feedback into advertising potential. As an added bonus, you get to give your creative team a break and have your customers do the work for you.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>STARTING THE REVOLUTION: A FEW EXAMPLES OF USER GENERATED CONTENT: </strong></h2>
Almost every industry can leverage user generated content. Beer producer Miller Lite had customers <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">take short videos</a> of themselves enjoying a beer and Tweet about the experience online. Miller the promoted the winning Tweets as commercials for their product. In addition to increasing their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social engagement and reach</a>, the user generated commercial campaigns also invited customers to be authentic, share their stories, and encourage other people like them do the same. Birds of a feather do, indeed, flock together. As consumers saw other individuals like them enjoying a Miller, they realized their own summer wouldn't be complete without a six pack of this refreshing, light beer.

Avantgarde hospitality brand The Standard Spa and Hotels took a similar approach. Over the Fourth of July, they asked customers to celebrate freedom and love by taking a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">video</a> of themselves and their significant other kissing. The hotel Instagrammed user stories showing same-sex, multi-racial, and even just your ""regular old"" couples spreading the love. This <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaign</a> clearly expressed the hotel chain's values, served as an invitation for guests to take part in their belief system, and - you guessed it - share their own stories.
<h2><strong>GIVE ME THE BOTTOM LINE, WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS: </strong></h2>
In addition to their great entertainment value, this user generated content is highly effective for your business.
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Increased engagement:</strong></h3>
One of the main benefits of using user-generated content is that it's highly engaging. Potential customers flock to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> accounts to interact with user-centric <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">campaigns</a>, post their own content, and like other user content they find. This means more people are spending more time on your site or social media accounts learning about and interacting with your brand. And you didn't have to do a thing.</li>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Viral potential: </strong></h3>
Even more enticing is the possibility that some of this content could go viral. As customers engage with other user generated content, they may be inclined to share what they find (or share their own content). There are hundreds of thousands of creative people out there. It only takes one really incredible <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">iPhone video</a> to transform your brand into the next YouTube craze. And more exposure means more sales.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Low cost, high impact: </strong></h3>
User-generated content also costs nearly nothing to produce. Once you think of a campaign that users would want to participate in, you simply have to promote that opportunity and your followers will do the rest. When timed alongside a holiday or dip in your sales cycle, the added bump of exposure can have a great impact on your sales.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Authenticity at its finest: </strong></h3>
The best part is, your customers don't have to take your word about your product. They can do what they do best: listen to their friends. Using user generated content lends an air of authenticity to any claims you make about your brand. It's one thing for you to think your product is great, but it means a lot more when someone else does. Take advantage of that simple fact.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To kick off a campaign using user generated content, you simply need an idea and an entry point for customers to participate. We have plenty of ideas to get you started, or would love to hear what you have been successful with in the past.

Don't be that brand: The ultimate video DON'T list,"There is no question that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production</a> can be a powerful marketing tool. Brands use video to educate consumers about new product types, walk prospects through a free trial experience, engage audiences, or showcase the features and benefits of a brand. Video can even simply be a way to delight, entertain, and reinforce brand imagery. There are so many great ways to use video that it's hard for us to pick one handful of really amazing advice. Instead, we decided to share our ultimate ""DON'T"" list. Avoid these guaranteed video fails on your next project and you'll be off to a good start.
<h2><strong>1. Remember people's attention spans are ... what were we talking about again?</strong></h2>
People's attention spans are shorter than ever. The average video watcher needs to be hooked within the first three seconds of watching or they are less than 15% likely to complete their viewing session. Similarly, even the most engaged users tend to drop off around the 30-second mark. When choosing a topic for your video - whether it's product, brand, or education related - choose something that can be conveyed in under 30 seconds, or that can be split into a series of smaller videos.
<h2><strong>2. SFW and being audio friendly: </strong></h2>
Some companies make the mistake of putting all their juiciest content into the audio portion of their 30 second commercial. While audio is indeed important, many viewers watching on their smart devices or at work may opt out of the sound on your video. If you've ever received an email with the subject line ""Not SFW"" you may understand why. Make sure that your video has elements that are clearly conveyed using visual cues, as well as sound, for maximum effect. For example, a 30-second spot with a man talking about your product behind a white background is only effective if that viewer has sound on. A more effective version would be him showcasing the product doing something amazing while talking about it. And don't forget, a few strategically placed headlines can go a long way.
<h2><strong>3. Boredom kills any 30 second commercial: </strong></h2>
If you don't want to watch your video, neither do your customers. Even the most serious topics can be tastefully presented using a little personality and levity. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Your local Orlando marketing agency</a> can help you strike the perfect balance between entertainment and education so your customers enjoy watching your videos enough to remember the key messaging you planted inside that content. You can also tap into your own customer base by soliciting user-generated content about your brand. Testimonials and product DIYs are almost always more effective when coming from customers to help generate trust and authenticity, so this may be a great option for brands on a budget or those without a robust in-house creative team.
<h2><strong>4. Location is everything, even in videos: </strong></h2>
Before you create a 30 second commercial, consider where you want to place it and what you want it to accomplish. A video focused on brand awareness would be shown in a different place than a product tutorial, for example. To help guide your video story boarding and production, make sure you know exactly where you're going to put them. If you simply create videos to have them, you risk missing out on using this awesome resource or misusing it and losing critical engagement.

3 reasons your hospitality company needs travel videos right now,"<p class=""Body"">Travel videos are indispensable to your brand because tourism is one of the first expenses to get cut when the economy is rough and often doesn't make it to the average consumers' weekly savings budget. When people spend money on travel, it's because they have invested emotionally in your hotel, travel destination, or tourism hot spot. A little disposable income never hurt either, but we have plenty of data to suggest a strong emotional connection to a vacation spot or hotel might even trump that weekly budget's bottom line when consumers are planning their next family vacation.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Because women account for 60% of all major tourism bookings and they are more inclined to respond to emotional marketing campaigns, travel videos are a perfect medium for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a>. Travel, in and of itself, is almost exclusively an emotional, rather than pragmatic, purchase, so travel videos should always be one of your most trusted marketing tools. Here are the top three reasons your company needs travel videos to keep your brand healthy and your customers engaged.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>1. Travel videos show rather than tell:</b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">To create an emotional connection that will entice and inspire prospective travelers to choose your destination or property over the many other options they have (including staying at home), you can't simply say you have a beach front property in the Caribbean. Instead, show off your infinity pool suites overlooking the teal waters and white sand beaches of the Caribbean Sea in a fun, flirty video featuring real-life guests enjoying your swim-up bar and sensuous spa facilities. Let your travel videos<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/""> tell your brand's story</a> rather than trying to describe it. As your prospective guests watch, they will project themselves into your brand and be more likely to want to visit.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>2. Travel videos boost engagement: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Seasoned travel pros AirBnB and Mexican-based restore chain Karisma Hotels &amp; Resorts use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a> as the main image of their homepage background because studies have found that dreamy, silent videos running in the background boost time spent on site and customer engagement with your content by up to 25-percent. Travel videos are alluring, and they have the unbeatable power to drop your prospects into life in your travel destination. Even short, silent clips play a subliminal role in creating this emotional bond. Short of visiting your property, travel videos beat photos and written text hand over fist every time. <b> </b></p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>3. Travel videos give your brand credibility: </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Although <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">videos can be edited</a> and photoshopped, it's a little more difficult to fake the look and feel of a tourism destination in a travel video compared to a print advertisement or digital banner. While many photo-based campaigns blend stock photography with proprietary content, most videos can't risk using stock reel in a property tour video for risk of false advertisement. Users are more inclined to believe the size of your rooms or quality of your property is what you tell them if they have seen it in a video. It's time to put your money - er, we mean camera - where your mouth is.</p>
<p class=""Body"" style=""text-align: center;"">Travel videos can be more inspiring than almost any other form of media.

Why you need a pro's help for digital ad creation and placement,"One of the biggest mistakes small- and medium-sized business owners make is assuming they can take a purely DIY approach to their marketing efforts. Being a Jack of all trades is critical when thinking about big picture strategy and crafting a holistic business plan for your organization, but never when it comes at the risk of being a master of none. In our world of ever changing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">digital marketing trends, rules, and regulations</a>, we like to think of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our team</a> as an ace in your pocket. We pride ourselves on deep, vertical knowledge about the most cutting edge digital best practices so you don't have to. As you delve into the world of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid advertising</a> and social media spends, there are so many options to choose from between your PPCs, PPUs, actual impressions, potential impressions, and reach. And we haven't even started talking about how to decide on placement, or whether to invest in big data and demographic trends. Placing a digital ad or banner by yourself has never been easier ... but partnering with an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">advertising agency</a> ensures your return on investment is worth the time and money spent on your campaigns.

Still not convinced? Here are the top four reasons you can't afford not to partner with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">trusted agency</a>.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1. Don't let programmatic digital ad placements rip you off:</strong></h2>
We are all business people. And media placement vendors are no exception. When selling digital ad spots, these companies charge their clients based on the volume you can purchase. Because agencies are often purchasing ad exposure for more than one organization, they frequently enjoy volume discounts and can charge you less to place the same ads in the same coveted spots. The good news is that because agencies also don't take on customers in direct competition with each other, your company will never be at risk of being pitted against your agency's other interests.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. Don't risk being outside of Facebook's or Google's design guidelines:</strong></h2>
As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">digital advertising</a> becomes more popular and customers demand checks and balances when surfing their favorite sites and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media platforms</a> to avoid being bombarded by spam, large digital ad exchanges such as Google, Instagram, and Facebook, have begun putting robust regulations around the types of content their users see and the frequency of ad exposure. Unless your team has a dedicated creative staff whose sole job is to stay up to date on these changes, you risk your ads being rejected or ineffective in these critical marketplaces. Our agency takes all platform changes, AdWords updates, and SEO algorithm enhancements very seriously so your digital ad is never turned down and you don't waste precious time and resources going back and forth with your placement account executives.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. Get smarter planning spends around trends:</strong></h2>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Advertising agencies</a> also have the distinct luxury to think about your business outside the fray and fire drills of daily operations. Even the best, most earnest intentions to create a year-round advertising or promotional calendar often get pushed to the wayside by the daily needs of running a business. When you partner with an agency, you have a dedicated team strategizing around the best times to run <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">digital advertisements</a>, how they should be placed, and how much you should spend on each digital ad throughout your business cycle. We take the guess work out of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">media planning</a> by staying current on your industry's forecasting trends and tailoring an ad calendar around your unique business needs. You simply have to flip the switch and enjoy the revenue as it rolls in.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">4. Dedicated ROI delivery and support:</strong></h2>
Never place an ad without knowing what the expected ROI will be again. Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">digital marketing agency</a> will help you strike the right balance between specialized ad exchange exposure and broad, programmatic distribution so your ads get to the right people every time. When our clients' businesses prosper, we do too, so getting results is our first priority. Working with an advertising agency takes the guess work out of digital ad placement. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> also serves as your first line of defense if something goes wrong with the ad itself.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Whether you decide to partner with an agency for peace of mind, or to maximize your return on investment, the choice is clear.

The marketer's quick and dirty guide to Pokémon Go,"Today, the <a href=""http://www.wral.com/durham-bulls-to-open-ballpark-for-pok-mon-go-players/15843536/"">Durham Bulls</a> are opening up their iconic baseball field to avid Pokémon hunters hoping to catch the elusive pocket monsters that are taking over the world (and our lives). The Bulls will charge people just to walk in the door in hopes of finding small digital creatures lurking around the field, and anticipate a massive turnout not unlike actual game days. And no, there isn't a game today - they are just capitalizing on Pokémon GO marketing. If you're asking yourself why you should care, we're about to tell you.
<h2>Pokémon Go marketing:</h2>
Pokémon GO is a Nintendo and Niantic Labs gaming collaboration that combines elements of augmented reality with the wildly popular Pokémon franchise. Using your smartphone's camera, you can search for Pokémon in the real world as the game guides you to local hot spots, historic landmarks, and hidden gems in your city where the creatures are hiding. It's not uncommon to see grown players and children alike scanning the world with their smartphones hoping to catch a glimmer of an unsuspecting monster. The app-based game has transformed people's lunch breaks, dog walks, and errands forever. ... And Pokémon GO marketing is about to transform your business.<strong> </strong>
<h2>What if my business is already a pokéstop?:</h2>
Niantic Labs has compiled a list of geo-based hangouts where Pokémon like to congregate or play based on user input. In the past, businesses could even submit themselves as a Pokéstop or Pokémon gym if they had a cool story or interesting space to share with the world. Due to the overwhelming popularity of Pokémon GO and the subsequent influx of submission requests as marketers and business owners realized the untapped potential of luring Pokémon (and potential customers ... we mean hunters) to their location, Niantic Labs has temporarily suspended this capability.

If you're one of the lucky businesses that is already tagged as a Pokéstop, you may have noticed an uptick in foot traffic as players visit your store. Instead of turning away Pokémon players (we will admit, Pokémon hunters' blank stares and distracted demeanor can make them somewhat hazardous - or at least annoying - to the rest of the world), invite them into your business with Pokémon GO marketing tactics. Or even better, get in on the game. You can use an in-game ""<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2016/07/09/how-pokemon-go-can-lure-more-customers-to-your-local-business/#7c0b0c177fe4"">lure</a>"" to attract Pokémon creatures to your business for 30-minute windows. Go ahead and announce you'll be having a Pokémon happy hour (lure included) or flash sale Pokémon frenzy and watch the gamers, and customers, roll in. The game's popularity will only increase, so don't be afraid to find creative ways to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">engage this new audience</a>.

Pokémon GO has given business owners a way to generate foot traffic at their brick and mortar establishments like no other geo-based or augmented reality program has done in the past. Niantic Labs has even alluded to future sponsorship and marketing opportunities inside the game so companies can leverage the Pokémon GO marketing potential. For now, bust out the chalkboard signs and Yelp reviews to let this alternate universe know you're worth a visit.
<h2>But what if there are no pokéstops in sight?:</h2>
Don't worry if you haven't been identified as a Pokéstop yet. There are still plenty of opportunities to take advantage of this hyper-trend. Log on to your local <a href=""http://meetup.com"">MeetUp.com</a> chapter or register an event with your local Chamber of Commerce for Pokémon GO enthusiasts to socialize. Although your space may not be a Pokémon hot spot, that doesn't mean players won't congregate together if you give them the opportunity to do so (after all, they may find a few Pokémon nearby anyway). And voila, suddenly you have a whole group of potential customers at your fingertips. Offering a discount to Pokémon players never hurt either. If your business doesn't need a boost of traffic, simply sharing articles about the Pokémon trend, or local insights into where to find them, can engage users with your social media community in new and meaningful ways. Engagement is the key to conversion, purchases, and sharing, so don't underestimate the potential of a good Pokémon article.

Taking advantage of these types of social or pop culture trends gives marketers an opportunity to engage with customers who might not have noticed them otherwise. Trust us, they may not seem to be paying attention to the real world, but Pokémon GO players are highly engaged with other enthusiasts. Embracing the Pokémon GO marketing craze is a broad, viral platform to connect with prospective customers who are hungry to connect to get more of this new, exciting world. Aligning your business with the Pokémon trend gives you an instant boost of popularity - or at least curiosity - for players and passerbys alike.

<h2 style=""text-align: left;"">Update!</h2>
More than 6 months from when Pokemon Go was created (see above), let’s explore how quickly its popularity came to an end, despite how wildly obsessed people were, and why the phenomenon turned out to be just a fad.
<h2>What is Pokemon Go?</h2>
Pokémon GO is a Nintendo and Niantic Labs gaming collaboration that combines elements of augmented reality with the wildly popular Pokémon franchise. Using your smartphone’s camera, you can search for Pokémon in the real world as the game guides you to local hot spots, historic landmarks, and hidden gems in your city where the creatures are hiding. It’s not uncommon to see grown players and children alike scanning the world with their smartphones hoping to catch a glimmer of an unsuspecting monster.  At its height, <i>Pokémon GO </i>had 45 million daily active users.The app-based game had literally transformed people’s lunch breaks, dog walks, and errands. … And Pokémon GO even started to transform businesses.

Our advice when this game was at its peak was to become a “Pokestop” and then advertise that you were one using a chalkboard or Yelp, so on and so on.
<h2>Why did it “die”?</h2>
Because of Pokemon Go’s precipitous decline, the game has been labeled a fad. But, what went wrong? Some argue that the game had a lot of missing features, while others say the game got boring &amp; didn’t introduce new features in a timely manner to keep their interest. Besides failing to introduce new features, Pokemon Go also removed popular ones.
<h2>What is going through Nintendo’s head?</h2>
While improvements and additions to the game have been made in the form of the buddy system, a revamped tracker and holiday events, there’s much more work to do in order for Pokemon Go to gain back its popularity. But, some people believe that Niantic is up to the challenge. You know what they say...only time will tell.
<h2>What happens if it makes a comeback?</h2>
We’re not thinking that’s likely, but hey, you never know! What we do know is that Pokemon Go tried to make<a href=""https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/valentines2017""> a “limited-time celebration” game for Valentine’s day</a> that was only available from 11:00 A.M. PST on February 8, 2017, to 11:00 A.M. PST on February 15, 2017, to encourage players to grab their valentine, get out, and explore the world around them, but it didn’t go over too well. In fact, many people didn’t even know it was happening.

For ideas on how your business might benefit from a few pocket monsters if a come back occurs, give your local Orlando marketing agency a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blogs/"">call</a>. We aren’t saying we’re obsessed or anything, but we know a thing or two about what attracts Pokémon fans to your place of business.

Integrate transmedia storytelling into your brand story,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">Transmedia storytelling</a> is a powerful tool that integrates marketing and entertainment across channels to deepen fans’ connections with the narrative. More simply put, transmedia storytelling helps bring entertainment to life. It uses a popular story – usually, a movie, television show, novel, or trend - and expands it from its channel of origin (e.g., television) into the mainstream world. For example, The Limited clothing brand released a line of Olivia Pope-inspired clothes based on the ABC hit drama Scandal’s main character. Blogs discussed what Kerry Washington’s character wore each week, “Gladiator” wannabes could dress like Miss Pope herself, and enthusiastic viewers could be part of the show in some small way … all while expanding the brand’s influence and revenue.

The idea of transmedia storytelling isn’t new. Large franchises from the likes of Harry Potter to the NFL have harnessed the power of integrating media platforms with games, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">apps</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">websites</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">merchandise</a>, and spinoffs that bring the magic of their brand into the real world. But one recent breakthrough has left them all in the dust. And your brand can’t afford to miss out.
<h2><strong>TRANSMEDIA STORYTELLING AND AUGMENTED REALITY: </strong></h2>
In 2010, we hit a critical turning point in transmedia storytelling. DreamWorks Entertainment debuted the family-friendly fantasy How to Train Your Dragon around the same time that augmented reality (AR) was gaining some steam as a new technology platform. Augmented reality represents the marriage of technology with the real world. Think: Google Glass. At that time, DreamWorks released an augmented reality app in which fans could interact with dragons by using the camera on the phones. Sound familiar? It should if you’ve been following the Pokemon Go craze.

In many ways, the How To Train Your Dragon app paved the way for augmented <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/virtual-reality-vr-video/"">reality as a viable transmedia storytelling channel</a>. While early AR adopters may have gone crazy for Google Glass and geo-based advertisements, the general population simply wasn’t ready for widespread applications of augmented reality. Just six years after DreamWorks’ first attempt to use AR as a transmedia storytelling vehicle, the public is finally ready.

Nintendo’s stock has soared an unprecedented 90% thanks to the newest combo of transmedia storytelling and augmented reality. Enter, Pokemon Go. Pokemon started as an anime series and evolved – as transmedia storytelling does – into a card game, clothing lines, toys, and more. Pokemon Go takes it one step further by encouraging fans to search for Pokemon in the real world using the camera on their phones. See, we told you that DreamWorks app sounded familiar.

The results for both the Pokemon brand and for local businesses alike are mind blowing (for more information about how local businesses can take advantage of the Pokemon Go craze, check out our Marketer’s Quick and Dirty Guide to Pokemon Go <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/pokemon-go-marketing/"">here</a>). Your brand could be next.
<h2><strong>YOUR BRAND MEETS TRANSMEDIA STORYTELLING: </strong></h2>
Whether your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand is telling a story</a> or complementing a story, you have the opportunity to become part of a transmedia storytelling narrative; and with the rapidly increasing adoption of AR, this process has never been easier. To determine how to use transmedia storytelling to your advantage, ask yourself these simple questions:
<ol>
 	<li>Is your brand part of a larger story or trend? If so, it’s time to start forging partnerships and taking note of where your customers are naturally discussing your story.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>If not, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">ask yourself</a>: what types of stories does your brand align with? Tangible goods and hospitality brands may have an easier time answering this question, but even service-based brands are packed with potential. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> of Orlando marketing agency experts is on call to help you brainstorm and build out an action plan.</li>

Use your digital media waste for your market research,"The rise (err, fall) of media waste strikes fear into the hearts of most digital marketers. You know the scene: launch day is finally here. Your team created a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">new advertising campaign</a>, complete with digital banners, a new landing page, blog posts, and an ad spend to prove it. And then, just two weeks later, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">analysts</a> tell you that online conversion has dropped, your prospects aren’t signing up via your lead gen funnel, and you’re getting a low click rate on your ads. Cue: panic mode.

Many people make the mistake of looking at media waste as … well … waste; but our team takes at different approach. Leave it to<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> our data-obsessed team</a> of Orlando marketing agency experts to put a new spin on an old problem. The reality is, you can’t avoid all media waste. As multi-device users surf and shop between their mobile phones, tablets, and desktops, some degree of media waste will occur naturally as the wrong customers are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeted or even targeted</a> in the first place. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to use that data to your advantage. Media waste is a phenomenal source of market research (without spending an additional dime than you planned to spend anyway).

Here are three tips to turn media waste into solid gold data insights:
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1. TEST EVERYTHING TO TURN MEDIA WASTE INTO MARKET RESEARCH:</strong></h2>
First, by launching any major campaign as an A/B test (either against legacy work that has succeeded in the past, or going live with multiple versions of your proposed work), you completely reduce media waste, while simultaneously reducing risk to your business. Yes, we just said that you could completely reduce media waste. Bear with us. No, that doesn’t mean that every test will be a winner, or that some campaigns won’t fail; but it does mean that you’ll gain insights into what KPIs are impacted which can, in turn, help you answer the pivotal “why.” <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">Comparing one campaign to another</a> helps you refine future creative direction and slowly build an understanding of how your market is behaving.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. USE MEDIA WASTE TO FAIL FAST AND LEARN BIG:</strong></h2>
Sometimes, knowing what <em>doesn’t</em> work is as important as what <em>does </em>work. Even if you don’t have a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">full-blown testing team</a>, you can use media waste to gain critical insights into what your customers don’t like. Eliminating media waste isn’t about eliminating failure; it’s about shifting your team’s perspective on what you do when you fail. It’s okay to fail fast so you can learn quickly and pivot boldly. If your team is never failing, you’re probably not taking big enough marketing swings to really shake up the business and inspire new trends in your team’s work. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> believes that failing is just as important as succeeding provided you do it in a way that doesn’t jeopardize your bottom line, which is why we recommend <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">testing or limited launch exposure</a> as you roll out big ideas. Go ahead, launch that crazy campaign idea. If it works: congratulations! If it doesn’t: don’t retire that campaign into a media waste graveyard, instead, mine it for key customer insights to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">inform your next strategy</a>.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. DON’T BE AFRAID TO APPLY DIRECTIONAL LEARNINGS:</strong></h2>
Many marketers hesitate when mining media waste for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a> because the volume may be low or insights may be murky. We like to call these “directional learnings.” Media waste may not provide conclusive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a>, but it does provide granular <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">insight into your audience</a>. Tease out these ideas and then test them to validate your hypotheses. Even simple user testing or a social media survey can add a few more data points to your research base. It may take a little longer to confirm your data than <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">purchasing market research</a>, but it is a lot cheaper and leverages work (and spending) that would be thrown away otherwise.

It’s all Roman to me: Understanding CPM campaigns,"CPM stands for “cost per thousand.” As in Roman numeral M. And if that sounds like Roman – we mean Greek – to you, you’re not alone. CPM advertising leverages the desire brands have to be seen. In advertising, media vendors charge brands based on every 1,000 impressions, or views, of a given advertisement. For example, a media vendor may charge $50 cost per thousand. Translation: that’s $50 for every 1,000 times your ad appears on a variety of websites, blogs, and digital news sources. But, just when you think you’re becoming fluent in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">digital ads</a>, a vendor may charge $300 for that same cost per thousand. And you thought all roads led to Rome.

The trick to understanding CPM units is realizing they are priced based on a variety of somewhat ubiquitous factors, including how often viewers tend to click ads, how narrow your ad audience is (i.e., did you choose the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">“spray and pray” model</a> or hone in on blogs your target market engages with), or the ad placement itself. Even the ebb and flow of your own brand popularity may play a part in your vendor’s media pricing. To help you navigate your strategy, we’ve created a cheat sheet of all the basic information you need to know before launching any digital spend.
<h2><strong>BATTLE ROYALE: CPM vs. CPC CAMPAIGNS: </strong></h2>
Before we go any further, let’s get one common point of confusion out of the way. CPM is <em>not</em> the same as CPC. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">CPC stands for ""cost per click.""</a> In other words, this represents the actual price you pay each time someone clicks your digital ad and has no bearing whatsoever on CPM exposure. While these two terms may seem similar, they are as different as the Greeks and Romans. When launching <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital advertisements</a>, you can choose either a CPM strategy, or a CPC strategy. Not both. On average, CPM units tend to be cheaper than CPC units. For example: $50 CPM vs. $1.05 CPC, which would be $1050 per thousand. The reason is because even though your ad may appear on a page one thousand times, that doesn’t mean every viewer sees, notices, or interacts with your advertisement. In this way, a click is more valuable because it represents higher intention and a more engaged user. Sometimes. The distinction comes from knowing the goal of your media spend. If you simply want brand exposure, CPM may be the perfect, most<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/""> cost-effective strategy for your organization</a>. If you’re using digital advertisements to close a revenue gap, CPC may be more effective in getting you to your bottom line.
<h2><strong>SO WHY CHOOSE CPM CAMPAIGNS: </strong></h2>
We love CPM campaigns to help build broad exposure, increase loyalty, or generate interest and excitement. CPM campaigns are great for established brands hoping to keep their products at top of mind and new brands looking to grow their customer base. They are great for all industries and all types of products. Generally, we recommend ads as a complement to any comprehensive end-to-end brand campaign that touches <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">web</a>, and maybe even <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional media</a> such as print or television. What makes CPM campaigns so effective is that you can get hyper-granular about where your ads appear. If you’ve launched a new children’s clothing line, you can feature your ad exclusively on parenting sites and mommy bloggers. If you are a financial advisor, you can introduce your firm on trade sites, bank homepages, and the financial section of the news. Unlike print ads and billboards, you know exactly who is seeing your ads and whether it is aligned with their needs.

6 ways to use social listening to improve your brand,"When brands are evaluating their digital teams, the value of social listening and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media managers</a> can be hard to quantify. The ROI – or return on investment – of social media can feel somewhat nebulous when compared to A/B testing or ad spends, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t valuable. Social media is a powerful way to engage customers and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">build your brand</a> experience in much the same way that public relations initiatives complement your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional marketing</a> efforts. On the other end of the social spectrum, social listening complements your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">data analytics work</a>. Social listening provides a wealth of data and information about your customers and your competition. If you’ve never used social listening to gain insight about your brand, you may be unsure where to start. The following six categories are easy places to find actionable insights.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1. SOCIAL LISTENING HELPS YOU DISCOVER PROSPECTS:</strong></h2>
Before you’ve even received your first follower or decided on your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media handle</a>, you can use social listening to discover prospective customers. Scour Twitter hashtags, Facebook searches, and trending Instagram posts that are aligned to your brand (or other brands like yours from sources such as trade journals, competitors, or aligned products) to discover users and influencers who <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">may be interested in your brand</a>. Follow them, share their content, and engage with them to encourage adoption with your brand, shares and referrals, and even sales. As these prospective customers begin following your social media accounts and opting in to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">emails</a> and blog content, you’ll find new opportunities to engage with and convert them from leads to customers. The beauty is that social listening is a self-renewing cycle as new hashtags and trends emerge, so you will never run out of prospects to draw from.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. INSPIRE COMPETITIVE SWITCHING WITH SOCIAL LISTENING:</strong></h2>
If you’ve ever seen an AT&amp;T or Sprint advertisement, you’re probably familiar with the idea of competitive switching. The telecommunications industry is famous for generating new customers by preying on the competition’s unhappy users. Any brand with a direct competitive set, or operating in a saturated market, can benefit from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">using social listening</a> to discover potential converts within their competitive customer base. Listen in to learn where your competition is failing, then do it better, and tell the world. Certain airline brands take it one step farther by using social listening to discover unhappy customers and then reaching out to them directly with promotions and special offers that make those customers’ threats to “never fly their competition’s airline again” possible. As an added benefit, this allows brands in hyper-competitive markets to compete without resorting to downstream price wars that hurt the industry at large. By leveraging service as a reason to switch, your brand can provide deep value and skip the constant promotions.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. LEVERAGE SOCIAL INFLUENCERS AND TASTEMAKERS:</strong></h2>
You know the phrase: “the squeaky wheel gets the oil.” And social media is full of squeakers. Many times this isn’t a bad thing. Discover vocal social media power users via social listening and then interact with them to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">promote your brand</a> and encourage their endorsement. To attract influencers with a lot of clout, consider a “surprise and delight” campaign that captures customers’ attention with a promotion, product sample, or special experience. A great example of this type of outreach is Mastercard’s “Priceless” Twitter campaign, in which the brand used social listening to mine for high-influencers, and then sent them complimentary concert tickets, massages, and restaurant certificates as part of a “Priceless Mastercard experience.” These vocal recipients were loud and proud in sharing Mastercard’s generosity and service. Even if those recipients weren’t actual customers, the appearance was that Mastercard valued and cared deeply for their customer base. Really, the brand endorsements were as priceless as the experiences they gave.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">4. KEEP CUSTOMERS HAPPY BY ADDRESSING AND RESOLVING ISSUES:</strong></h2>
On the flip side, your social listening may uncover unhappy customers who are frustrated with your service experience or products. In these instances, consider social listening as the gift of raw, unfiltered, totally honest feedback. Often times, customers who flock to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> are simply looking for a place to feel heard when the customer service process breaks down. This can serve as a great coaching tool for the individuals who normally address service issues, while giving a voice to your customers that they so desperately need. Address customer concerns as you uncover them, even if it’s just to acknowledge their experience and offer your sympathy. Your company may consider a more robust escalation path for serious issues or completely overhaul your service process as a result.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">5. USE SOCIAL LISTENING TO CONDUCT MARKET RESEARCH:</strong></h2>
Social listening is also a great way to discover general sentiments regarding your brand, a certain product, or the customer service experience. Sure, you can pay for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a>, but social listening provides similar data and insights into trends, reach, and forecast for a lot less money. That said, it isn’t the only data tool you should be using. Social listening provides exceptional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">qualitative insight into your actual customers</a>, rather than the general and quantitatively more powerful insights found in big data market research. For scrappy startups and on the fly <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/quantitative-research-services/"">research projects</a>, social listening is the perfect answer to your data needs.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">6. SOCIAL LISTENING IS ALL ABOUT THE DATA:</strong></h2>
Because at the end of the day, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">it’s all about the data</a>. Social media lets you talk to and interact with your customers, while social listening let’s you, well … listen. And listening is the single best way to get data about your customers, make informed decisions based on facts rather than opinions, and help you – once and for all – answer the age old question of how much social media is worth. The stronger your social base, the more data points your listening will uncover. It’s a proprietary pool of information that helps you keep your finger on the pulse of your customers’ needs, track your brand engagement, reach and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand sentiment</a> over time, as well as your company’s growth.

Media buying agencies in the age of Madison Avenue kickbacks,"Over the past few weeks, we’ve shared a few posts on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buyin</a>g and CPM campaigns and how to decode <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a> jargon. In each post, we’ve mentioned that partnering with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">local Orlando marketing agency</a> can help you get better rates and ensure your ads are targeted in the right way when <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">starting a new campaign</a>. Today, we want to delve a little deeper into some of the serious reasons why it’s so important to partner with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">trusted marketing agency</a> before forging a new relationship with a media vendor.
<h2><strong>I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT, CATCH ME UP: </strong></h2>
Last month, the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) released an investigative report on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying firms</a> that shook the trust of agency-client partnerships across the nation. Over the past seven months, the ANA has delved into whispers that media buying firms were accepting rebates and kickbacks as great as 20% from large, media supply corporations in exchange for placing their clients’ ads through designated outlets. Instead of championing their clients’ best interests, these firms fell prey to the same temptation that led commission-based financial analysts to ruin right before the recession in 2008.

In essence,<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> media agencies</a> would accept money from their clients intended for a media spend, and then receive a portion of that money back from their media supplier if they reached a certain volume of ad sales or placements. This encouraged media firms to sell more (perhaps unnecessary) ads and inflate the price of their placement services. To disguise this practice, media suppliers and agencies used a variety of convoluted schemes to diffuse the appearance of a direct kickback, including offshoring the rebate, hiding the supplier-to-agency price points, and more. To read the full ANA report, click <a href=""https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/industry-initiative-media-transparency-report"">here</a>.
<h2><strong>HOW TO HANDLE MEDIA BUYING MOVING FORWARD: </strong></h2>
Despite being somewhat shocking (especially to the average consumer), this report shed light on a long-held industry suspicion and paved the way for reform. The ANA will begin making recommendations and contract restructuring mandates in the coming months that will limit this behavior and realign agencies with their clients by promoting transparency and punishing illegal incentive plans moving forward.

Major <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a> houses have the opportunity to come forward with their own suggestions, and a healthy dialogue both refuting and supporting the investigation is underway. The conversation finally frees agencies big and small to address the issue head on and make changes that will support the growth of their agencies while protecting the customers.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">Media buying</a> has not slowed down… if anything, the importance of a strong <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">digital advertising strategy</a> is more defensible than ever before as more and more business shifts to the online channel. The solution isn’t shying away from media spends, but rather putting checks and balances in place that will protect our customers. It's also important to educate businesses to do their due diligence before partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a> firm or trying to conduct media purchases on their own without skilled representation.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong> WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE MEDIA BUYING SCANDAL: </strong></h2>
As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your Orlando digital marketing agency</a>, we believe it is our duty to represent our clients’ interests. We have met our fair share of exemplary media suppliers and have asked the tough questions that help us forge partnerships with only the best suppliers and most direct vendors.

We can, indeed, negotiate better rates and placement for our customers in many instances… but it is never at the expense of your trust.

4 AdWords changes to alter how you think about PPC management,"Whether you're an SEM specialist or simply overseeing your company's digital advertising spend, you probably follow changes to Google's AdWords the way day traders follow the stock market. Google's notoriously shifting algorithms and the media usage pattern. Ad spend rules can seem like a barrier for the average small business owner, and a Byzantine maze of rules and regulations for agency pros like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our Orlando-based digital marketing team</a>. Although there's no tried-and-tested way to beat or get ahead of Google's changes, the best way to stay in the game is to simply stay on top of critical updates. Over the last year, a few key AdWord enhancements have changed the game yet again and we're here to unpack the top four updates that might change how your company thinks about PPC management.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Goodbye right rail: </strong></h2>
One of the biggest changes that Google AdWords has announced is the removal of the right rail search results. In the past, paid advertisements would pop up in the top 3-4 search results, followed by a list of organic rankings through the fold and onto the following search pages. To the right of these results, advertisers could feature their business ads in small, less prominent paid slots. This gave small businesses and smaller budgets a chance to bid against the big dogs without overextending themselves.

Those days are over. Today, only four search ads will populate before organic results begin. And there's no right rail. In short, no other opportunities. Additionally, only seven natural results will appear on the first page, meaning that there are fewer paid and organic slots on the coveted Google page one. For advertisers, this means you may have to pay more for paid slots. It also means you should have started<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/""> polishing your SEO</a> key words list and bringing your content up to speed ... well ... yesterday. Organic rankings are going to be more important than ever before with these new limitations on paid ads.

If you have previously relied solely on PPC AdWords, it's time to call in the experts at your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">local Orlando marketing agency</a>. These changes are impossible to ignore and will fundamentally change how marketers think about vying for top spots in the Google ecosystem.
<h2><strong>App developers rejoice: </strong></h2>
Mobile and tablet applications are more important than ever before in the average user's media usage pattern, which is why Google's AdWords' improvement to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">app promotion</a> is something to celebrate, rather than fear. Once this feature is released, you'll be able to target anyone who has already downloaded your application. Chances are, if your app isn't brand new, you've made enhancements, fine tuned your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">UX</a>, and rethought how your app can better serve your customers.

Use this new retargeting tool to reengage your current audience and teach them about new features in your app. You will be able to link directly into the app based on your users' keyword searches, making it easier for you to provide self-service help and guided support. Instead of wasting paid advertisement dollars targeting prospective customers or trailers, use this update to ensure customers searching for your product login, app help, or information find exactly what they need the first time.
<h2><strong>Conversions now optimized: </strong></h2>
Not all conversions are created equal when you're considering a customer's holistic<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/""> media usage pattern</a>, which is why Google AdWords' new conversion optimization updates are one of the most important updates on our list. If you are using Conversion Optimizer, Target ROAS or other bidding tools, you're in luck. With this update, you'll be able to pick and choose which KPIs you want Google to rank as part of the bidding process.

Any serious SEM specialist will enjoy this nuanced refinement because it acknowledges that one KPI isn't more important than another and allows you to optimize based on which metrics are most profitable for your business.
<h2><strong>Calling all Adwords extensions: </strong></h2>
Although this update seems simple, it's probably our favorite. Google's newest AdWord extension allows you to add a few extra lines of text featuring a unique CTA based on your business needs. For example, you might include a call out for a free trial, or special seasonal promotion. And no, it does not replace or interrupt your normal product or business descriptions, so you can rest assured that your most important information - and a few extras - are getting to your audience.

This update is a great way to lower your care and support calls by featuring your FAQ page, boost sales with a special CTA, or call out your latest and greatest app. In other words, the sky is the limit. So don't miss out.

The 1 thing that matters in corporate video production,"Today's general media usage pattern favors images and videos over pages of text and long, descriptive paragraphs. It's true that text-based sites are still critical in conveying news and detailed information, but the average user is more engaged with and spends the most time on visual content. One need only look to the cult-like popularity of the image-based news site Buzzfeed to understand this trend. Images are such a critical part of the average media usage pattern that a typical user scans a website in under three seconds and draws a conclusion about the brand, site, or content simply by the visual elements alone.

This is why corporate video production is so important when <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">positioning your brand</a> and engaging your audience. To help guide your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/""> video production</a> needs, our full-service Orlando marketing agency is here to help. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/work/"">Click here</a> for examples of our work. When you're ready, our team will help you craft the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">perfect marketing videos</a>, assist with the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">story boarding process</a>, refine messaging, and convey tone through images. As you begin thinking about the types of videos your brand can't live without, here is our cheat sheet for success. We'll share the one thing that matters most in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">corporate video production</a> and two bonus tips that certainly help.
<h2><strong>MUST DO: Get painfully aligned to your audience's media usage pattern: </strong></h2>
If you are an avid reader of our blog, you have probably heard us tell you to get painfully narrow about everything from media spends to big data investments. We like to think of this as our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">""Golden Rule"" of digital marketing</a>, so you shouldn't be surprised that it's our top recommendation when thinking about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">corporate video production</a>. When your content is too broad, you risk never engaging your users enough to break through the hundreds of ads, blogs, and distractions vying for their attention. No product or service is suitable for everyone, and your content shouldn't be either.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">When you know your audience very well</a>, you'll understand their unique media usage pattern, you'll know the types of material they enjoy most, you'll know where they spend their time online, and you can tailor your content to their exact needs. By getting painfully aligned with a specific target audience, you may feel like you are alienating customers who don't fall into that specific subset. Flip your perspective here. Instead of alienating customers, you are simply embracing the quality over quantity mindset to build your business with ultra loyal customers who will engage with and stay with your brand. As this base grows, more subsets will begin learning about and adopting your brand as a secondary audience. In other words, by going narrow, you'll get broad. If you start broad, you risk never getting noticed at all.

This is critically important when producing corporate videos. No <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">branding video</a> should be longer than 30 seconds, and most viewers stop watching after 10 seconds if they haven't been hooked by your content. You simply can't afford to try to appeal to everyone. To create highly engaging content, you have to have a clear vision and know what your audience will enjoy. Let <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">our team</a> help you create a unique story that grabs your customers' attention and wow's your audience.
<h2><strong>SHOULD DO: Tell a story that fits seamlessly in their media usage pattern:</strong></h2>
One of the best ways to capture your audience is to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">tell a story</a> that fits seamlessly into their media usage pattern. A great example of this is Bergdorf Goodman's annual holiday catalogue campaign. Each year, to kick off their holiday season, Bergdorf Goodman creates a themed video that introduces their top most outrageous, sumptuous, over-the-top, elaborate gifts. Naturally, they tease these must-have items on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, and seal the deal with outrageously indulgent email videos and Instagram posts. Our favorite? The 2011 dog-themed shopping spree. Check it out here: <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5vb8kGLfhpM"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5vb8kGLfhpM</a>. The effect creates a magical, luxuriant world that speaks to their most high-valued customers and every single aspirational shopper that ever stumbled upon the brand. Take time to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">get to know your audience</a> and understand why they are surfing on certain platforms or using certain <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">digital tools</a>. This will help inform the types of stories they will enjoy seeing and how you can relate your product back to these themes.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">Telling a story</a> also helps create an emotional bond between your target audience and your brand. Regardless of whether you choose to target your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">corporate video</a> at the top of the sales funnel or at the bottom of the funnel; or whether your content is product-focused or brand value-focused, relating your corporate video back to an emotional hook helps differentiate your brand and break away from the competition. Remember those Bergdorf dogs? They didn't make BG products any more luxurious than Saks or Neiman Marcus items, but they did help this brand stand out. While it's always important to balance your story with critical facts and figures about your product, the vast majority of purchases are decided based on emotion rather than fact when all other elements are equal. So go ahead, get emotional.
<h2><strong>SHOULD DO: Make every frame count: </strong></h2>
Never create videos simply to create a video. And don't try to accomplish something in a video that you could do in a powerfully placed image. Every frame of your video should convey something an image cannot. Usually, this is why having a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">compelling story</a> is so important. Similarly, video can be an invaluable asset when showcasing the unique features or high quality that sets your product apart.

Every frame of your corporate video should be power-packed so that your audience understands the value of your product whether they watch 10 seconds or 40 seconds. Your video should also stand alone with or without sound because you can never guarantee your audience will view with the volume on. Because you can't control variables such as sound or timing, every single frame of your corporate video needs to convey your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">key message points and product details seamlessly</a>.

&nbsp;
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Because corporate video production is one of the most nuanced forms of marketing and requires close collaboration with your creative team, it is often most effective to use a digital market agency to streamline the process and reduce video waste. Remember, our team of highly-skilled videographers and storytellers are <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/work/video-production-services-case-study/"">here to help</a> if you get stuck.

How to design the perfect influencer endorsement video,"One thing is clear. Millennial consumers' media usage pattern leans heavily on social proof, user-reviews, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">non-traditional marketing techniques</a> when forming purchase opinions. Millennials don't need some advertising executive to tell them what they like; which is why digital marketing firms such as<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> our Orlando-based agency</a> have had to find new ways to balance the media mix and create compelling content that harnesses authentic, user-generated material to build trust rather than relying on hard-sell techniques.

Investing in user group communities, review sites, social sharing, and blog posts from your industry's tastemakers are all great places to begin<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/""> filling your media mix with user-focused content</a>. These platforms are an opportunity to engage with your best customers, seek feedback from those that need support, and generate referrals. Another tool we love is the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">power of influencer</a> endorsement videos.

YouTube is the second most visited site aside from Google, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a> is one of the fastest growing and most engaging channels available in the digital marketing world. When combined with the powerful support of a super user or popular v-logger, you can't go wrong. The trick is crafting the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">perfect endorsement video</a>. Trust us, they are not all created equal.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Figure out where your influencer video fits in your audience's media usage pattern: </strong></h2>
Assuming you are creating an influencer endorsement video to generate more sales, it's important to choose where you will showcase this video strategically. Understanding your audience's media usage pattern will help you do this. Keep things simple by partnering with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Orlando marketing agency</a> to determine the best placement and channel exposure for an endorsement based on your audience's media consumption habits. Our agency can determine exactly where your audience is surfing, which devices they are using, and how to effectively expose your endorsement in a way that fits into their<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/""> natural media usage pattern</a>. If you attach a spend to your video, an agency will also help you negotiate the best rates and ensure your distribution is on point.

If you choose to place <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">your own video</a>, start by determining what platform you want to use. The most common and popular video platform is YouTube; but Vimeo, Vine, Meerkat, and SnapChat (to name just a few) all offer a variety of options for quick social endorsements. We recommend having a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">feature length influencer endorsement</a> that lives on YouTube accompanied by supporting social material across other platforms. The next question you want to ask is whether you will feature this video on their platforms or yours. The best answer is to go with whichever has greater influence or a bigger audience. You may even choose to expose the video on both if you and your endorser are happy with this arrangement.
<h2><strong>Choosing the right topic for the millennial media usage pattern: </strong></h2>
Another reason why it is important to understand your millennial audience's media usage pattern is to guide the type of topic you want your endorser to cover. A good influencer endorsement will likely fall into one of the following categories:
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>How-to videos and walk-throughs: </strong></h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/commercial-talent-agency/"">How-to videos and walk-throughs</a> often show the features or functionality of an app or platform, help prospective customers understand how to use a new product that has little or no competition, or educates customers about how to use a difficult tool. The value of these types of endorsements often show that seemingly difficult products are actually simple, or incredibly effective, when used properly. Your influencer should be able to clearly boil down your product's use case in a language that the average consumer will understand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Unboxing and product showcases: </strong></h3>
Although it may seem somewhat strange, there is a huge market for videos that showcase the experience of unwrapping - or ""unboxing"" - an item and previewing that product's look and feel. This type of endorsement adds a level of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">authenticity to claims of quality</a>. For example, toy companies and electronics brands rely on this type of endorsement to help generate excitement about new product releases or to illustrate the unique value and quality of their products in highly competitive markets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Extreme usage or testing: </strong></h3>
A great example of extreme use endorsements would be an influencer using a high-powered blender to dissolve a cell phone. Although no average consumer would purchase a blender with the express intention of destroying their cell phone, this endorsement shows that the blender goes above and beyond user expectations. After all, if it can blend a cell phone, it can probably handle those kale smoothies with ease. Having an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">influencer</a> generate this content adds an extra layer of trust to confirm that the use case isn't a simulation or exaggeration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Storytelling: </strong></h3>
<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">Storytelling</a> is best used for service endorsements rather than consumer goods. An influencer endorsement of a service provider often blends personal experiences that capture their audience on an emotional or human level to show why an intangible product or experience is important.</li>
</ul>
Choose a topic that naturally aligns to your target audience's organic media usage pattern. For example, millennials are more likely to choose a brand that contributes to the community in some way or that is connected with charitable efforts. Knowing this, you can choose an influencer whose endorsement tells a story about why your product or service is changing their local community.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Find the right influencer and tone: </strong></h2>
Similarly, make sure you choose the right endorser for your product. There are plenty of people who will be eager to enjoy their fifteen minutes of fame, but not all influencers will resonate with your target audience. Ask for referrals or invite super users to tell their story, but don't promise any exposure until you are certain they are a good fit for your brand. If in doubt, lean <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">on your local agency</a> to help find the right influencers for your product or conduct some scrappy user testing to determine whether that influencer will be well received. If you are having <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">trouble finding an influencer</a> to volunteer, you can also research top industry tastemakers or bloggers and exchange products for endorsements; but be careful that all compensation is disclosed and follows appropriate legal guidelines. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Your local Orlando marketing agency</a> can guide you there. Finding the right influencer helps you strike the right tone for your product and ensures you will get the most exposure you can within a given market segment.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Don't shy away from the bad: </strong></h2>
Although we wouldn't necessarily recommend leading with any influencer endorsements that show your brand in a negative light, sometimes taking ownership of mishaps, making apologies, or acknowledging faults alongside a powerful influencer can serve as a balm to quell a negative reputation or solve public relations snafus. Strong influencer endorsements that discuss your brand's evolution can also be effective when repositioning your product. For example, Buick's recent campaigns featuring alternative bloggers and indie rockers has helped shake the brand's stereotype of being a car for old people. The trick in this type of influencer endorsement is attracting your new audience or solving a reputation problem without alienating your old customers.

How to create a media plan for 30-somethings year olds,"Millennials - in particular 30-something year olds with growing disposable income and mature media usage patterns - are one of the largest and most critical consumer subsets. Understanding how to attract them starts with understanding that millennials have a distinct media usage pattern that differs from their predecessors and will likely differ from the next generation.

Millennials who are making meaningful purchases in the current consumer market are what we like to call ""digital natives."" That means they grew up with computers and the Internet. That said, 30-something year olds can probably still remember a time when they needed to look up directions instead of relying on their smartphones and GPS, or turned to their friends for referrals rather than hitting Google and Yelp for the most up-to-date business reviews.

The result is that millennials with the most purchasing power (read: yes, older) have a distinct media usage pattern that blends some of the most digital-savvy habits of Generation Y and Z with more traditional habits inherited from Generation X and the Baby Boomers. Cracking the millennial <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">media usage pattern</a> helps your business target and engage this critically important consumer subset by targeting your spend where they are most likely spending their time.
<h2><strong>The mobile media usage pattern: </strong></h2>
Let's start with where to find them. More than 70% of all millennials have a smartphone. 30-somethings are no exception. However, as ultra-rich tablets, such as the iPad Pro, are hitting the market, these tech-savvy gadget lovers are turning in their laptops and desktops for more streamlined options that fit their jet-set blend of work-life-balance and remote connectivity. It goes without saying that all millennials are connecting to the Internet in some way, shape, or form. At the same time, older millennials are still purchasing paid television subscriptions (as opposed to strictly streaming options such as Netflix and Hulu), newspaper subscriptions, and print books. Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">media planning</a> should take into consideration the value of a heavy emphasis on mobile and tablet-ready trends without completely abandoning traditional media outlets. We recommend a 60% - 70% digital spend compared to traditional media in most cases. If you're unsure where your product or service fits into this balance, our team of digital experts are available to guide you in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">media planning process</a>.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Business meets pleasure: </strong></h2>
One important trend to note is that the average millennial media usage pattern often blends business with pleasure. While millennials are surfing Facebook, they may also be scanning for news headlines and updates. While they are Snapchatting their friends, they may be sending clips from the most recent presidential debates. This important media usage pattern suggests that millennials use their personal experiences to choose their business partners. Unlike Generation X, which typically drew a staunch line between their work life and their personal life, millennials want to invest in brands and business counterparts that speak to them on a personal level. Let your media mix help them make this decision by humanizing your marketing campaigns. Yes, it is always important to earnestly communicate the value and trustworthiness of your brand - but don't forget to showcase what makes you human along the way. For example, Square does a great job of striking this balance. While showing how their hardware can transform a smartphone into a point of sale system, complete with top-of-the-line security and speed, they feature small, local (often quirky) businesses such as candy makers or regional photographers. These campaigns speak to the millennial media pattern by blending business and pleasure seamlessly.
<h2><strong>Cracking emerging media usage patterns: </strong></h2>
Don't be afraid to explore emerging media trends. 30-something millennials may still enjoy a great Super bowl commercial, but they are usually early adopters of new media trends and eagerly incorporate new technology into their media usage pattern. That's right, we're telling you it's okay to jump on the Pokemon Go craze, explore how augmented reality and 3D mapping could elevate your media mix, and to keep an eye out for new trends. Our Orlando <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">marketing agency</a> has the inside track on emerging digital tools and we can help you craft something that will keep your business on the cutting edge of your millennial audience's interests.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/marketing-research/"">Planning a perfect media mix</a> for the millennial audience starts with understanding that their media usage pattern is a one-of-a-kind balancing act of golden-age advertising techniques and futuristic digital trends.

4 ways you can improve your brand’s media mix like a pro,"Choosing your media mix is one of the most important decisions you'll make as a digital marketer, so there's always a little extra pressure to balance your spend. Between ad campaigns, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social platforms</a>, and community marketing, your options are nearly endless. Make your media mix work for you, instead of becoming a slave to your budget, by<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/""> testing into the mix</a> that works for your customers and continuously iterating toward improvement. Trust us, optimizing your media isn't as difficult as it seems.
<h2><strong>1. Prioritize your media mix: </strong></h2>
The first thing is to realize (and accept) that your team can't do everything at once. And that's okay. Even the biggest companies can't cover every channel and every demographic perfectly. If they could, there would never be any competition. What you <em>can</em> do is flawlessly prioritize your media. If you already have data around how your social platforms and channels are performing, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">choose your top one or two platforms and invest there</a>. If you are just beginning to optimize your mix, see where your competition has a strong presence and begin exploring there. As your return on investment and company grows, you can expand and test into more channels. Also recognize that it isn't just about prioritizing where you post. Make sure you prioritize your time as well: spend 50% of your time creating content and contributing in your communities, spend 30% of time engaging with your various channels, and 20% of your time finding content and scheduling shared posts.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>2. Use your media mix to set and measure goals: </strong></h2>
Improve your media mix by using it to set and measure goals, and then by refining your spend and media presence accordingly. Always include a call to action (CTA) in your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">posts and digital advertisements</a>. Ideally, you should choose a different CTA for each channel or ensure you have clear tracking tools in place so you can determine which mix performs best. Tracking the performance of your mix helps you forecast goals for the upcoming quarter and year, lets you test different engagement methods to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">discover what your audience needs</a>, and helps you refine your creative approach. In this way, your media mix becomes a vehicle to generate business and to align your team around common goals and business needs.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">3. Diversify your media mix:</strong></h2>
Once your media mix is performing solidly, it's time to begin diversifying. Use old content that you previously ran as a print ad or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">repurpose social media content for a digital ad</a>. You might even consider exposing other peoples' content as long as it does not pose any competitive risk and you have their permission. Swap content across channels and track which types of content perform best in each. A great piece of content or creative campaign may perform tremendously on a landing page with a paid spend, but it may struggle as a social ad. Most times, discovering what will work best, and where, starts with a hunch. Test into these ideas in small percentages so you never risk your core business, but never be afraid to try new things.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">4. Don't forget to listen:</strong></h2>
Last, but never least, don't forget to listen. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">Social listening</a> is an important part of how to determine your strategy. Invest in listening tools, partner with your local Orlando <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a>, or scour your media channels for customer feedback or key data points. Remember, your media mix is first and foremost for your customers, so letting them guide you is the most important key to balancing your media mix like a pro.

Your agency must be able to answer this online ad spend question,"In the United States, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketers</a> are spending more than $60 billion per year on online ad spend campaigns. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> of Orlando marketing agency experts know those are your precious marketing dollars at work, which is why we encourage all of our clients to ask those tough questions when they work with us and with other agency partners. If your agency can't answer the following questions, you're probably wasting money on your online ad spend.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>QUESTION 1: HOW IS MOBILE TECHNOLOGY DRIVING ONLINE AD SPEND GROWTH? </strong></h2>
Online ad spend across mobile channels increased 66% year over year when compared to last year's ad spend. There are many reasons for this growth, including an<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/""> increased emphasis on app usage</a> and discovery (just click here to read why Apple is releasing new <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid app advertising</a> for more on that); more secure and streamlined mobile shopping experiences that drive 80% of digital consumers to indicate they will purchase something on their mobile device or tablet this year; and the ever increasing overlap between<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/""> social media</a> and our personal and professional lives. There is absolutely no doubt that mobile technology is one of the biggest drivers for online ad spend. When you ask <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">the team</a> at your local, Orlando marketing agency which trends are most important, or where you should invest now to support future mobile growth, we recommend:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Responsive design: </strong>Despite the fact that mobile technology has been exponentially improving over the past decade, many company sites are still not mobile-friendly. Before you do anything else, update your site with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">responsive design technology</a> that seamlessly adapts your site to any device and any size.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Social ads: </strong>The prized millennial customer uses social media to<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/""> find new brands</a>, celebrate brands they love, and complain when brands let them down. Aside from search engine marketing,<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/""> social media advertising</a> is one of the most powerful ways to reach out to your target demographic. Social mobile apps such as Facebook, SnapChat, and Instagram lure users to their mobile devices hundreds of times per day, making this platform one of the most ubiquitous ways to reach your audience where they are already spending time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Paid app spends: </strong>If you have an app, it's time to explore how paid advertising in Google Play or Apple's App Store can deepen your customers' <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">engagement with your mobile app</a>. Whether you want to encourage discovery for a new app, or drive use in your existing customer base, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">paid online ad</a> spend can bring much needed attention to your mobile app, putting you in a prime position to take advantage of the mobile boom.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>QUESTION 2: HOW IS PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING IMPACTING YOUR ONLINE AD SPEND? </strong></h2>
Don't let anyone fool you. Programmatic advertising is impacting the online ad spend world in a big way. In fact, close to two thirds of US online ad spends will come from programmatic purchases this year, with mobile accounting for 60% of that spend. The trend is already here. This breakthrough allows robots and crawlers to do highly labor-intensive work that once led to human error and lag time between insights and actions. Instead of relying on media buyers to tag ads, comb through insertion orders, and tweak your spend, programmatic ad buying frees your agency to focus on driving your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy</a> and fine-tuning your spend based on a wealth of hard, up-to-the-minute data. One of the most popular forms of programmatic ad buying is real-time bidding, which automates the term purchasing process by balancing ad inventory against audience data, and your resources and business goals.

Ombré: The 2016 comeback of CSS gradients has arrived,"History has a funny way of repeating itself. We see this in fashion (we're still wondering why flared pants keep coming back in style), in politics and history, and in design trends. This year, CSS gradients are making a comeback. But this time around, we're calling it ombré, and doing it using css gradient code, and giving Photoshop a rest. The results transform this 90's-style splash trend into a sleek, modern accent tool that surprises viewers without overpowering other design elements.
<h2><strong>CSS GRADIENTS ELEVATE FLAT DESIGN: </strong></h2>
The flat <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">design trend</a> took the creative world by storm and helped cut through the mounting visual clutter of hyper-realistic, hyper-saturated, hyper-detailed design made capable by today's<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/""> powerful digital tools</a>. But, like many trends, once flat design reached an extreme, tastes have begun to slowly swing in the other direction. We still love the clean simplicity of flat color palettes and how minimal design focuses the eye; but we also crave a few dynamic elements that bring just the right amount of depth and interest into the picture. Layering a subtle ombré wash onto a flat background or using graduated color to denote shadow adds elements of realism onto flat design principles without departing from the essential simplicity of this trend.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>YOUR DEVELOPERS AND DESIGNERS WILL LOVE YOU: </strong></h2>
Despite the complex visual intrigue ombré delivers, it's surprisingly simple to implement. In some ways, we credit technology for this design comeback. Today's website coding language allows developers to create a consistent set of rules, called a CSS, that dictates how certain elements (such as your hero image or tile modules) are treated across the site. Designers and developers can work together to define these rules in accordance with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand style guide</a> so that your designs and the finished website product are more closely aligned with each other, and with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">guiding creative principles</a>, than ever before. CSS gradients are a perfect example of how technology can make your designs more consistent. Instead of using Photoshop to add a gradient onto every single photo where you want this style to appear, CSS gradients use a simple snippet of code that deliver radial, horizontal and vertical linear fades almost anywhere on your site. They can be layered on top of each other to combine two or more colors for truly remarkable - and replicable - effects. These gradients can be seamlessly duplicated anywhere you want them to appear. This frees your designers from the tedious process formerly needed to create web-ready striking ombré images on your site, while making implementation more consistent and clean across the board. Trust us, your perfectionist of a developer will thank you later.
<h2><strong>WHERE YOU CAN USE CSS GRADIENTS: </strong><strong> </strong></h2>
Spotify made ombré backgrounds popular with their jewel-tone color overlays and bold fading. But you can also use CSS gradients on individual elements. Consider adding a gradient to a button to draw attention to that element without beating viewers over the head. Use gradient in your font to create beachy, laid back text elements. Add ombré to your borders and shading for a surprising twist on tried and tested visual cues. Or layer colors on top of each other to change the tone and feel of your site (think: muted nudes for an ethereal vibe or punchy primaries for a more jovial energy). CSS gradients can be applied almost anywhere due to the flexibility of the code used to implement them. Because this effect is easy to implement and edit, don't be afraid to experiment how it looks around your site.

How to (color) scheme like a pro: Website color schemes basics,"If you think you've seen every blog post about website color schemes already ... think again. Most posts about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">website color</a> schemes showcase lists of the best website color combinations on the market. They pop with energy and elegance. You might even feel a little design envy while skimming these sites' perfectly balanced photography, high quality imagery, and tasteful color palettes. But, let's be honest: most of these blogs don't tell you how to make <em>your </em>site look that good. Sure, we're proud of our work. And if you want to see some examples of how we've helped clients use color theory to amp up their businesses, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/work/"">click here</a>. But we also want to give you the tools you need to start (color) scheming like a pro. Below, we'll walk you through the guiding principles of color theory to help you<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/""> create effective website</a> color schemes that you can start using today.

Creating effective website color schemes isn't as hard as you think once you understand a few essential principles of color theory. Some of the basics, you probably already know from days in your middle school art class (like how primary and secondary colors are positioned on the color wheel, or mix to make new colors). And some color theory boils down to intuition based on your own taste and preferences. Remember, it's your brand. There's no formula that generates perfect website color schemes every time, so sometimes it's good to trust your gut and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">simply go with what looks good to you</a>. That said, these principles will help you along the way.
<h2><strong>SET THE TONE WITH YOUR MAIN COLOR: </strong></h2>
The most important decision you need to make is choosing your main color. A little color psychology (and some common sense) can help you here. Colors tend to channel tones and emotions that subconsciously prime your audience to feel certain emotions. Red signals urgency and energy. Green resonates freshness, nature, and cleanliness. Blue has a calming and trustworthy undertone. Yellow can bring elements of levity and lightheartedness to your brand. These descriptions should feel like common sense to you because we have all been primed to feel these associations based on a variety of environmental and cultural cues that link color with emotion. It makes sense for a sporting goods store to use an energetic color such as red and orange, or an earthy earth tone such as brown or rust for a main color because there is a natural link between these colors and the outdoors ... but can you imagine that same brand choosing a soft purple or hot pink as a primary color? We agree: it's a stretch.

Think about your own brand and the emotions you want to link with it. Jot those feelings and associations down, then cross reference them with your primary colors. Now, you're off to a great start. If you get stuck, we recommend choosing an image (whether it's your logo, a picture of your headquarters or office, your products, or even something that just speaks to your brand) and brainstorming what colors stand out to you. This can help you break free of the norm if you feel like your primary color is too trite or a little overplayed. For example, a surf shop owner may choose a picture of the beach when thinking about her brand, but feel drawn to a burst of magenta shrubs in the corner of the frame. Unlike the expected blue or teal, the magenta adds an element of excitement and adventure that might just be the color her brand needed.
<h2><strong>CHOOSE SUPPORTING COLORS, AKA UNDERSTANDING COMPLEMENTATION: </strong></h2>
Next, invite some friends. Complementation refers to how well colors mingle with other colors. Hues that are across the color wheel from each other tend to be visually pleasing because they create a natural visual balance by complementing each other. As you think about additional colors that will support your signature tone, consider how well they work together. Make sure you have at least one additional color that creates real contrast when layering colored text or grabbing your viewers' attention. Most supporting color choices fall into one of four types of website color schemes:
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Complementary </strong></h3>
Your brand colors should play off each other, rather than conflict with each other, which is why complementary website color schemes are one of the most popular choices. Start with your main color, then look across the color wheel to see what its opposite is. This tone will stand out when placed near your main color without competing or creating visual friction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Monochromatic </strong></h3>
If your complementary color is too bold for your brand, you may consider dabbling in monochromatic color schemes. Instead of choosing additional colors, you use different tones or shades of your main color. This creates a sense of visual consistency and uniformity that can be very aesthetically pleasing. Just make sure your colors are not so similar that you lose your visual dynamics. To do this, experiment with the saturation, tone, and warmth of your main color.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Analogous </strong></h3>
A variation on this idea is analogous website color schemes. Typically, they feature three to four colors adjacent to your main color on the color wheel. Like monochromatic schemes, this option creates a visual consistency that can boost familiarity with your creative elements; however, analogous colors provide a little more variety and interest on your website. This is especially useful to mitigate the negative impact screen size, brightness, HD display styles, and other outside factors can sometimes have on monochromatic color palettes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Triadic </strong></h3>
In recent years, triadic website color schemes have become wildly popular. Start by drawing an equilateral triangle from your primary color on the color wheel. The two opposite points of your triangle (and their neighbors) represent unique color complements that are visually intriguing, but not as starkly contrasted as your primary color's main opposite. Triadic colors give you a little more flexibility if you want to use several colors for your brand without the risk of overwhelming your viewer.</li>
</ul>

10 logo design inspiration tips fresher than Doug E. Fresh,"Have you ever noticed how <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo design inspiration and trends</a> (especially popular ones) can get recycled so many times they start looking more tired than last summer's overplayed one-hit-wonder? Don't let your business logo get stuck in a rut like a B-list celebrity. Use these ten easy, fresh logo design inspiration tips to keep your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand image</a> fresher than our boy Doug E. Fresh. And yes, we just went there. It's 2016, after all : it's time that your logo started looking that way.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1. Logo design inspiration starts with tone and color:</strong></h2>
One of the cardinal rules of logo design inspiration is setting the tone of your brand. Your logo should capture the heart of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand values</a> and communicate the vibe of your products or services. Whether you want to channel exquisite service standards, casual comfort, or extreme luxury, color is one of the best ways to set tone. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">Color psychology</a> is a powerful, scientifically backed tool that can instantly augment any visual cues you use in your logo. For example, blue is one of the most popular and comforting colors to the human eye, which is why so many brands choose shades of blue to establish a sense of familiarity or trust in their logos. Just think about this range of ""blue"" brands: Facebook, American Express, IBM, Volkswagen, General Electric, and Gap (as a start).
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">2. Use negative space to affirm brand values:</strong></h2>
Many designers, rightfully, focus their efforts on creating strong primary typography or iconography when crafting a logo. But sometimes, leveraging negative space can add a subtle cue or affirmation about your brand that customers gravitate toward. FedEx ingeniously does this by creating a forward arrow in the negative space created between the ""E"" and the ""X"" in their name. The forward arrow captures the nature of their shipping business model while signaling speed and movement. Because the negative space is so subtle, customers subconsciously think about these values on their own without being told. When your logo is that good, you don't even need a tag line.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>3. Sometimes you need to ditch the text for fresh logo design inspiration: </strong></h2>
Our next piece of advice is somewhat risky and definitely controversial. Depending on your brand, you may be able to eliminate words all together. This is easier to pull off when your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand name corresponds to something literal</a>, such as electronic giant Apple. On the flip side, having a nonsensical symbol can sometimes be a very powerful aid in creating unique, one-of-a-kind brand association (think: Nike), but you risk missing out on recognition in the early stages of your company's evolution if you go this route.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">4. Break the rules with animated logos:</strong></h2>
It's safe to say that animated logos are not the norm. Although <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a> is swiftly becoming one of the most ubiquitous and important pieces of the marketing mix, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional marketing techniques</a> still inform most digital design principles. For this reason, most logos use static images and text ... But true logo design inspiration can break the rules and push boundaries. Experiment with an animated logo that uses subtle movement to reiterate part of your brand or draw your customers' eye to a certain feature. The trick is not using animation for the sake of animation; but rather, using it to make a specific point. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Our team</a> of designers can help you assess how risky to be with your logo to push the creative limits without risking your brand.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">5. Get playful and play on words:</strong></h2>
Word play or tongue-in-cheek logos that incorporate images into lettering are light, whimsical ways to add something extra to a traditional text-based logo without deviating too far from clear <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand-image association</a>. Taking artistic license with lettering (think: turning a Y into a cocktail glass), using tasteful double entendres or homonyms, are all ways to express aspects of your brand without falling back on tired imagery or overused typography.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">6. Understand typography to drive logo design inspiration:</strong></h2>
In that vein, it's important to understand the general best practices of typography if you decide to go with a text-based logo. Right now, monogram-style logos with thing, sans-serif font, rustic, hipster-esque circles, arrows, antlers or foliage are all the rage. These are all great visual elements and there's a reason why they are popular. When searching for logo design inspiration, however, be careful not to lean too far into what is trendy or popular in the moment. Your logo should be <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">uniquely you and stand the test of time</a>.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">7. Don't be afraid to be classic with literal imagery:</strong></h2>
If it's not broke, no need to fix it. If you have a natural association between some aspect of your brand and a strong visual cue don't be afraid to lean on that. Get creative, get a little abstract, or switch up the styling from time to time, but there's no need to recreate the wheel if you have something that works. Let a professional designer, such as one of<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> our experts at your Orlando-based marketing agency</a>, help you come up with ways to freshen up the natural visual cues of your brand without compromising them. Classics are always in style - and inspired.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">8. Invest, invest, invest:</strong></h2>
Think of your logo as your signature. It's your chance at a<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/""> first impression with your prospective customers</a>. It's your first line of defense to help current customers remember your brand. And in that sense, it may be your most valuable asset. It's a wonderful place to invest time and resources when prioritizing your marketing budget. Sometimes you really do need a pro's help for true logo design inspiration to strike, and if we only had to pick a handful of places to invest your marketing dollars, we would list your logo near the top of our list every time.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">9. Opinions DO matter:</strong></h2>
Normally, we let opinions roll off our backs without giving them a second thought. Live loud and proud. That said, your logo is one of those times when opinions really do matter. At least to your customers. What you may consider to be a strike of genius logo design inspiration may not resonate with your customers, so before you overhaul your entire <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy</a>, do some user testing and seek validation from your real customer base. Their opinions are the only ones that matter.
<h2><strong style=""line-height: 1.5;"">10. Seek logo design inspiration absolutely everywhere:</strong></h2>
And last, but certainly not least, we recommend that you seek logo design inspiration absolutely everywhere. Encourage all your team members to share ideas, conduct customer surveys, look to nature, watch movies, and seek unconventional ways to transform your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">logo and brand styling</a>.

4 of BIGEYE's most creative minds spill favorite design advice,"<p class=""Body"">We're about to let you in on a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> exclusive. Four of our Orlando marketing agency's most creative minds dish on their favorite design advice. Whether you're a designer, a business owner, or a production specialist, their advice speaks to the challenges we all face in our fast-paced, marketing-driven world. So sit back, relax, and soak in the good stuff.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>Seth Segura, Creative Director: Solve the right problems.</b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Our Creative Director Seth brings a lot - and we mean a lot - to the table. His experience ranges from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriting and design</a>, to thought leadership and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy</a>. But at the end of the day, he always leads with results-first, which is why his favorite design advice hinges on solving customer or business problems. As a designer, it's always tempting to lean into what is aesthetically pleasing; but as a creative marketer, you need to think about what problems you're solving for your customers through design. When you look at a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print ad</a> or a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">web page</a>: yes, it should absolutely look visually pleasing. Color balance, line, and composition are always king (unless you're talking to the content folks on our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">digital team</a>). But, your design must also enable customers to experience a new emotion or help them accomplish a specific task. For this reason, designers who <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">specialize in user experience (UX) creation</a> and page layout are some of the most highly sought-after talent in the marketplace. In addition to having a strong creative eye, these types of designers are trained to think about how customers will interact with their work. For them, that webpage button isn't just red because it looks good ... It's red because it draws the customer's eye to your business call to action and signals how they can complete a task. Fashion, meet function.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>Rhett Withey, Lead Designer: Be up for the challenge.</b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">Rhett has amazing intuition about what creative elements will work, and which will fall flat. In addition to having a natural sense of design principles, part of his success stems from tackling challenges head on. When thinking about his favorite <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/"">design advice</a>, he knows that chasing new design trends and emerging media every time something new comes out can turn a designer into a jack of all trades and a master of none; but that getting stuck in a rut, or resting on your portfolio's laurels isn't enough to stay on cutting edge of the design world. Rhett balances his own deep expertise against stretch goals and challenges that cultivate his leadership and design skills. To do this in your role, spend at least 15% of your time experimenting with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">new design media</a>, raise your hand to lead a challenging new project, add research spikes into your work flow, take a class to explore new techniques, or partner with other creatives on your team. There are literally hundreds of ways to polish your skill set without compromising your current projects once you commit to doing it. While it's always tempting to stick with the status quo, taking on new challenges fine-tunes your intuition and will make your work even sharper.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>Dani Alfonso, Designer: Value your work.</b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">One of the best pieces of design advice we can offer is to be passionate about and value your own work. Dani's passion for her work shines through in both her professional output and in all areas of her life. Whether she's traveling, enjoying time with her miniature schnauzer, working at her desk, collaborating with our team, or finding inspiration in the world around her, Dani lives with earnest passion that embraces creativity around her. And that is critical when designing for a living. As Chris Spooner, design blogger and theorist once said, ""the clients aren't always right. It's okay to disagree with their demands if you can back up your own opinions with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">professional theory</a>."" There will be times, as a designer, you will need to throw away work that you love, or defend work your clients hate. The trick is recognizing those situations when they arise and handling them with grace and confidence. Designers are one part creative expert and one part translator, charged with interpreting their clients' business needs against the background noise of opinions, deadlines, and resource constraints to create something beautiful and functional. To do this, a designer needs to be confident in their knowledge and skills -- and not afraid to share them.</p>

<h2 class=""Body""><b>Matt Hutchens, Video Producer: Manage the madness. </b></h2>
<p class=""Body"">As a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video producer</a>, Matt needs to manage crew members, wrangle environmental factors like lighting and weather, anticipate unexpected snafus, capture the perfect angle, balance timing, and weave together tone and messaging ... to just name a few. It makes sense that his design advice is about having a design process that inspires creativity and ensures quality work. To help manage the madness that inevitably arises as business needs change and situations evolve, have a design ""Q&amp;A checklist"" that covers the basic checks and balances necessary before signing off on a project such as spacing, spelling, contrast, and color in line with your brand guidelines. Designers often bear the brunt of the creative burden, so don't be afraid to consider time savers such as collaborating, outsourcing, or finding good ways to use stock <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">photography or video</a> (when appropriate). Strategic time saving techniques free you up to do your best, most inspired work. Put some space around your creative process so your ideas stay fresh and your focus on point. Whether that means creating a design den for your creative team or letting people work from home once a week, figure out what your business needs to thrive and don't be afraid to do something unconventional to enable your most talented minds.</p>

3 reasons why ad agencies are more effective at media buying,"Okay, let's get this out of the way right up front. Sometimes, we can be biased. Yes, we love our team of Orlando marketing experts. And yes, we are partial to the smart, passionate, digital-obsessed account executives that make our agency unique. But with absolutely no bias whatsoever: advertising agencies - in general - are always going to be better at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a> than the alternative. That includes working with dedicated media buying agencies and any DIY ad spends you had planned for the quarter. Before the rebuttals come rolling in, let us explain why.
<h2><strong>REASON 1: PLANNING MAKES PERFECT END-TO-END MEDIA BUYING EXPERIENCES</strong></h2>
The key ingredient for a perfect media buying experience starts and ends with good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">planning</a>. While media buying agencies have deep vertical knowledge of the buying process and dedicate their time cultivating relationships with ad placement services, advertising agencies bring a critical breadth that rounds out the marketing experience. Because advertising agencies hire specialists dedicated to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a>, <em>and</em> <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search engine optimization</a>, <em>and</em> <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media management</a>, <em>and </em><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/"">creative services</a> all media purchases are grounded against your holistic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/"">business strategy</a>. Specifically, advertising agencies align your media spend against your key goals and any other marketing mechanisms supporting these needs. This includes cross-channel audience research, balanced spending, and clear analysis and fine tuning as campaigns go live and generate data and results. Planning your spend across channels, rather than creating piecemeal marketing experiences as they pop up, ensures your marketing dollars are being distributed evenly and put toward the best use -- but most importantly, that they are all working together.
<h2><strong>REASON 2: ADVERTISING AGENCIES ARE A ONE STOP MEDIA BUYING SHOP</strong></h2>
Show me the money. Give me the best bang for your buck. However you want to say it, you can rest assured that you are getting the best value possible when you invest in an advertising agency to support your media buying needs. Similarly to media buying firms, ad agencies will always get you the best rates on your placement because they have the luxury to buy ad spots in bulk (something individual or small business owners cannot do). In addition to that, advertising agencies oversee the entire advertising lifecycle, making the media buying, creation, and placement experience a one-stop shop. This is especially important for businesses that don't have a dedicated creative team or who are growing faster than their existing team can support. Advertising agencies reduce strain on your current team without adding more middle men than necessary when you have contacts for each piece of the marketing mix.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>REASON 3: BEYOND MEDIA BUYING PARTNERS</strong></h2>
In a world with increasingly transactional business relationships, having a trusted advertising agency can be a breath of fresh air. When you work with a firm like our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Orlando advertising agency</a>, we make it our responsibility to get to know your brand, your team, and become engrained in your culture. In this way, advertising agencies become extensions of your own organization. Consider us a second line of defense or a toolbox of sharpened knives ready to cut into your toughest marketing problems -- no matter what they may be. Yes, our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Orlando marketing agency</a> would be happy to be your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a> partner, but we'd also be so much more more. Advertising agencies zoom out from the campaign at hand to look at your customers' lifecycle, your promotional calendar, media relations, and digital footprint. Together, we can stay on top of the latest marketing trends and brainstorm innovative new campaigns that will break through the marketing clutter.

We think of these three concepts as the marketing world's ""Goldilocks rule.""

Apple Eases Friction In Customers Media Usage Pattern,"This time last year, Google Play introduced its first paid search model for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">app developers</a>. The search giant understands how people use apps as part of their day-to-day media usage pattern to accomplish tasks while barely thinking about it, which is why <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">app discovery</a> is such an integral part of their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">business strategy</a>. Need an app to workout in your hotel while traveling? Check. Need an app to discover new recipes for a housewarming party? Check. Need an app to find the lowest travel fare? Check. We could go on, but suffice it to say: there's always an app for that.

This month, we were excited - but not surprised - to hear that Apple has taken a page out of Google's playbook. This fall, Apple will be rolling out a full-scale paid search model in their App Store. Combining paid search with app discovery reduces friction in customers' media usage pattern lifecycle by making it easier and safer for them to find reputable apps that meet their needs when they want them. In other words? This is beneficial for the end user (because they can find what they want more seamlessly); beneficial for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">app-based businesses</a> (who want to encourage app adoption and discovery); and potentially very lucrative for Apple (hello, ad sales). Apple's App Store is Google Play's biggest rival and the only game in town for apps developed for iOS devices. In 2015, Apple earned $20 <em>billion </em>in revenue from the App Store and other services (think: Apple Care, etc.). Although Apple executives tend to keep the granular details of the company's financials tight to their chests, rumors suggest close to two-thirds of app downloads come from search hits in the App Store. If this is true, paid search in this space could drive a substantial amount of exposure to emerging apps and significantly improve the customer discovery experience.
<h2><strong>APP SEARCH FOR ADVERTISERS TO FIT CUSTOMERS' MEDIA USAGE PATTERN: </strong></h2>
The best part about Apple's new paid search model is that it fits seamlessly into the App Store experience people already expect during their typical media usage pattern. Only one featured app will appear at the top of customers' search results in the App Store, and the only distinguishing difference between a paid app and a non-paid app will be a blue ring around the app badge indicating these results were sponsored. Unlike paid search engine ads that sometimes feel jarring or separated from organic search results, Apple's new model makes it easier for advertisers to promote their apps without disrupting the customer experience.

Naturally, this prime real estate will be a pay to play opportunity for search marketers. Advertisers will participate in a bid auction to secure top keyword terms correlated to their app based on a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">pay-per-click</a> pricing model (there will be no pay-per-impression option at this time). In tandem, Apple will also offer demographic and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">audience targeting</a> to keep advertising costs reasonable while ensuring app discovery is as close to a perfect match as possible for the customer. It goes without saying that businesses can use this inconspicuous search experience to support their paid SEO and AdWords campaigns and close the loop between website engagement and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile app discovery</a>. This is especially important as customers' media usage patterns almost always include multiple devices across their smartphones, tablets, and computers. No matter where your customers are surfing, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">paid search strategy</a> can support their habits and needs.
<h2><strong>THE WINNING PAID SEARCH MODEL FOR APP-BASED BUSINESSES: </strong></h2>
Although Apple's new paid search program is currently in beta testing, the full program will be released this fall. And we couldn't be more excited. That's our way of saying there's no time to waste if your business has (or is developing) an app.<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> Our team</a> of Orlando marketing experts can help you balance your current paid spend to include app advertising while guiding you through this new experience from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience selection</a>, to keyword term bidding, and everything in between to create a seamless end-to-end app experience that supports your customers' media usage pattern.

The paid app program presents a unique opportunity for businesses to reenergize sluggish app usage and encourage adoption if your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social channels</a> haven't been as successful as you'd like them to be in reaching this goal. Even if all your channels are performing well, paid app advertising supports an increasing trend of customers searching for apps or related tasks directly in the App Store as part of their media usage pattern. We predict this will be an integral part of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">paid marketing mix</a> by the end of the year and one your business should not miss.

Snapchat takes on business marketing: Not just selfies any more,"We have what we like to call a good news/bad news situation on our hands. If you’ve been holding out against Snapchat as a last bastion against gratuitous selfie-taking and over sharing, you might need to give up on the game. The good news is that it’s for a really good reason. Earlier this spring, Snapchat began introducing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">customized geofilters</a> that allow individual users and business accounts to create photo overlays for their location, store, or event. Starting at just $5 per filter, excited Snapchatters can promote everything from their wedding or a girls’ getaway, to product launches and charity events. Several months after launch, business marketers are starting to see the value.

Naturally, Snapchat has not missed the opportunity to monetize your monetization efforts. The price of each filter is set on a sliding scale based on the filter’s exposure size (which must fall between 20,000 square feet and 5-million square feet) and length of time the filter runs (the shortest amount of time a filter may run is one hour). When we initially learned about Snapchat geofilters, we were reticent to jump on the trend because we weren’t sure what a business would do with them. Now that we’ve <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">brainstormed a few awesome</a> ideas (if we do say so ourselves), we have officially joined the bandwagon.

Geofilters let you engage with your target audience while they are already consuming content, which increases your chances of catching – and keeping – their attention. Here are our top three ways to get started.
<h2><b>Start with a product launch:</b></h2>
Dip your toe into the geofilter pool with a location-based promotion. This is a fantastic vehicle to promote a product launch. Most obviously, it presents an opportunity increase foot traffic to a brick and mortar store as customers pose with your new product or entice nearby Snapchatters to stop by (you might consider offering a 5% or 10% discount to new customers if they Snap your product on site). You shouldn’t feel restricted to solely promote your physical location, however. Michael Kors introduced their new summer line of sunglasses in key <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">target markets</a> (such as Miami and Los Angeles) with a filter that allowed users to pose with a digitized overlay of these sunglasses on their face. Even if those Snappers weren’t purchasing the sunglasses, it <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">raised awareness</a> about the product and generated buzz for other would-be customers. They key is ensuring the filter geography is set to locations where potential customers routinely congregate. And because geofilters can span a 5-million square foot radius, that shouldn’t be too difficult. Seriously, does organic marketing get any better than this?
<h2><b>Graduate to an event filter: </b></h2>
The novelty of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">purchasing a Snapchat filter</a> for a personal event is fairly obvious. For businesses, it’s a little more nuanced. First, consider your options. An event filter may be valuable before an event to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">promote ticket sales</a> or fundraising efforts. It may be useful during an event if you are unveiling a product, special edition item, or unique feature. Similarly, it can help generate buzz during a reoccurring event such as a conference or festival. It may even be useful after an event ends if attendees are taking ideas and products home with them (how cool would it be if there was a customized geofilter after the Apple product release conference for those lucky few who get to beta test new products?). Geofilters promoting an event are one part marketing gold and one part public relations magic, so timing is everything to ensure you get a positive return on investment.
<h2><b>Or go for an anytime, lifestyle filter: </b></h2>
If you happen to have a business that represents a lifestyle brand, you’re in luck because geofilters are a great idea anytime. Brands that let customers signal they are a certain type of person think: community establishments such Starbucks or a local coffee shop, bars, or restaurants, membership-based clubs and organizations, car dealerships, tourist hot spots, and resorts. Brands, such as Pacific Sunware, that have a certain type of customer (in this case, surfers and beach lovers) can also benefit from a custom filter to help <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">increase brand awareness</a> between other likeminded customers.

Despite ourselves, we love the idea of Snapchat geofilters because it turns your customers and fans into brand ambassadors and marketers. In other words, you just increased your marketing team by … oh … 10,000.",,9/28/2016 8:48,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Enlight1-5.jpg,snapchat-takes-business-marketing-not-just-selfies,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Crash course: The Internet of things & it's impact on businesses,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Imagine driving home from work. As you near your house, your parking garage door opens, your thermostat adjusts to your preferred ambient temperature, your lights turn on, and your front door unlocks. Your oven even turned on before you left the office because you need to prep for a dinner party later this evening. This is not science fiction. It's the Internet of Things. And it's happening now. The Internet of Things simply refers to various objects' ability to connect to the internet and work together in harmony with you and each other to complete tasks, improve performance, or streamline activities.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Most consumers think about the Internet of Things as it relates to creating a ""smart home"" - like the scene above - because the concept is easy to understand and smart home products are prevalent within the marketplace. They are also surprisingly affordable. For example, a Nest smart thermostat is only about $250, an August automatic lock is approximately $175, and a starter kit for Philips Hue light bulbs are only $130 for a set of three bulbs. But there are many other ways the Internet of Things can and will revolutionize our lives and how we do business.</span></p>

<h2><b>How businesses are getting involved: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Although it is easiest to imagine how the electronics and appliances industry can be enhanced by the Internet of Things, almost every business has potential. Don't believe us? Consider your favorite toilet paper brand. Amazon just introduced a new, internet-based clicker that allows you to push a button in your bathroom and have toilet paper mailed to your house on-demand. How about your auto insurance? Progressive let's you plug a small device into your car that tracks your driving via the internet and lowers (or raises) your insurance based on how you actually drive. The links between the Internet of Things and commerce are nearly endless ... If you have the vision to see and implement these ideas. That's where we come in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Digital specialists such as the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">team at our Orlando based marketing agency</a> are trained to think about natural links between your products and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">bleeding edge technologies</a> such as the Internet of Things. We believe that having a holistic presence across channels is the key to success in today's competitive landscape. Together, we can help you search for overlap between your existing campaigns and emerging marketing opportunities tied to the Internet of Things. Because the Internet of Things is usually enhanced by social media, virtual payment tools, and GPS services, you probably already have the foundation to bridge the gap.</span></p>

<h2><b>Marketing with the Internet of things: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As marketers, there are three main areas to consider when building a campaign using the Internet of Things:</span></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Location-based discounts and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promotional materials</a></span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Service reminders or cues</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/""><span class=""s1"">App development and enhancement</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Although the Internet of Things can enhance efficiency, usage, and product development, it may not always be possible for you to change your product or invest in technology to leverage the internet in those ways. This is why we love opportunities such as location-based discounts and service cues. They are easy to implement with almost any budget and provide a gateway to the Internet of Things that will help you gauge your customers' reaction and adjust your marketing techniques accordingly.</span></p>
<p class=""p2"" style=""text-align: center;""><span class=""s1"">Give us a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/""><span class=""s2"">call</span></a> when you're ready to plug in ... literally (and figuratively).</span></p>",,9/22/2016 8:15,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Internet-of-Things.jpg,the-internet-of-things-impacting-business,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
6 ways digital marketing can transform automotive sales,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Generally speaking, car dealerships are not known for embracing emerging marketing trends such as the digital wave. Not because they don't want to; but because they don't always need to. Many local dealers enjoy great success with traditional, direct-marketing tactics and regional outreach via print and broadcast media. However, as national and international automotive sales manufacturers have begun experimenting with digital marketing tactics, car dealers now have a new wave of tools to remain competitive in a hyper-saturated market.</span></p>

<h2><b>Digital marketing brings brand awareness across tiers: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Studies suggest that at least 40% of all digital spends correlated to car sales will target <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a> rather than direct offers. At the manufacturing level, we see this from major retailers such as Mercedes-Benz. During the past to years, the brand has used robust <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">event campaigns</a> to generate buzz about the introduction of their new C300 model with great success. Once customers know about the brand or car model, they will move down the next marketing tier to discover a local dealer who has aligned to these trends. Although it may feel redundant for dealers to promote brand material rather than specific sales offers, it is important for customers to easily find a local presence that mirrors what they are seeing nationally. Investing in digital branding allows your dealership to rise to meet your customers needs as the move downstream toward a certain product or brand. In this way, you and your customers will meet in the middle. This tactic allows you to lead with value rather than discounts as you attract customers who are actively seeking a certain product or brand.</span></p>

<h2><b>Search marketing keeps your brand top of mind: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Okay, now your customers have found you. They are excited about the latest model of their dream car and are weighing their options. Big purchases, such as cars, often have a longer sales cycle than traditional retail products, so keeping your dealership at the top of mind is of critical importance. Paid, retargeted, and organic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">search campaigns</a> give you the opportunity to gently nudge your customer toward the point of sale without bombarding them before they are ready to complete a sale. As customers are looking for information, your website should be optimized to pop up before your competition so your dealership is a place to find answers, not just buy cars. This keeps customers coming back to your site again and again as they move toward a sale. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">Search optimization</a> is your first line of defense against competition and easier to implement than you may think. Our team of experts at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your Orlando marketing agency</a> can determine the best terms to target, what words will make you stand out against your competition, and how to prioritize your search initiatives.</span></p>

<h2><b>The surprising importance of being mobile-friendly:</b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In that vein, your site needs to be mobile ready. We know that customers don't buy cars on their phones. But they do search for prices, search for the closest dealer to their home or office, and search for promotions that are running when they are ready to buy. According to <a href=""http://cars.com/""><span class=""s2"">cars.com</span></a>, 43% of shoppers start their search on their mobile phones or tablets. We recommend investing in a responsive website design for best results or, at the very least, carefully considering how your website looks and functions on a smaller device. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Mobile marketing</a> is one of the first places car dealers try to cut costs, but it may be one of the worst places to make the cut. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Click here</a> to learn about some of the amazing mobile strategies our agency has used for business owners just like you.</span></p>

<h2><b>Digital marketing augments accessibility: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In many ways, car purchases are a sale of opportunity. If one dealer doesn't answer the phone, the customer will call the next closest vendor. If a purchaser can't find the information they need online, they'll find it somewhere else. Being accessible and responsive is key to success when you are competing against other equally qualified dealers in your area. Digital marketing allows you to be more responsive than the competition. Consider investing in chat, email services, and social media monitoring that allow your dealership to get to opportunities before someone else does. We realize this is yet another channel to manage when you already have phone calls and the floor to look after, but the modern customer expects businesses to be ""on"" 24-7, available, and ready for business when they are. Love it or hate it, the customer expectation wins.</span></p>

<h2><b>Battle dealer stereotypes with digital customer service: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's no secret that car dealerships sometimes have a reputation for being deceitful or opportunistic. Using <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency"">digital marketing</a> to combat these stereotypes gives you the opportunity to showcase your business values. Address issues right away on social media. Encourage customers to review your dealership on Yelp. And don't ignore your site's comment section and inbox. Digital marketing enables you to use less resources to tackle service issues head on, which, in turn, builds goodwill and trust between your customers and prospective clients. You can directly handle negative feedback and foster relationships with those who have positive sentiments to share. Trust us, a little goes a long way.</span></p>

<h2><b>Show some post-sale love: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Digital marketing also gives dealers the opportunity to foster post-sale relationships with their customers. This can generate referrals, repeat sales, and brand advocacy. You might consider featuring a ""customer of the day"" on your website or social channels, emailing clients with service reminders or seasonal greetings, and using digital marketing to schedule periodic outreach completely unrelated to sales. Nurturing your customers relationships at every stage of the customer journey reinforces all the work you did throughout the sales process and will help create happier, more valuable customers over their lifecycle.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And that's only the tip of the iceberg!

We'll work with you to tailor a custom strategy that uses the technology you already have in place to build stronger customer relationships than ever before.</span></p>",,9/25/2016 8:48,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Enlight1-4.jpg,6-ways-digital-marketing-can-transform-automotive-sales-industry,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why your business should care about Optimal GeoSpace,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you're a digital marketer, you've probably heard the term ""geofencing,"" which refers to our ability to track and serve location-based advertising to customers. But, since July, there's a new game in town: Optimal GeoSpace. UberMedia - known for pioneering the customer data and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social marketing</a> sectors - introduced a more refined version of geofencing that tracks the nuances of your customers' behavior in real-time format. These insights reveal granular data about when, where, and how your customer journey evolves.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This information helps marketers <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">determine the type of campaigns</a> that are most relevant to your customers and how they like to shop. Most importantly, it allows us to be at the right time, at the right place, with the right content. These breakthroughs are especially important for direct marketing initiatives as well as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">business planning and investing</a>. Here's how.</span></p>

<h2><b>Optimal GeoSpace for direct marketing: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You wouldn't email your customers about the hottest new winter coat in July (or maybe ever if your customers are based in South Florida like our team of Orlando marketing agency experts). You probably wouldn't host a blowout sale on boating supplies in a landlocked, desert community. On the flip side, almost every major electronics store runs a Black Friday or Cyber Monday sale because that's what customers expect. These are the basics of direct marketing. All promotional marketing should be relevant and timely based on your customers' <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">expectations, seasonality, and purchasing patterns</a> so they are primed to purchase prior to receiving your offer. This concept is simple when you zoom out and look at annual business trends and sales cycles. But Optimal GeoSpace takes this concept one step farther.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now, imagine your restaurant's peak hours are between 6:00 pm - 10:00 pm, but you want to begin offering a happy hour starting at 5:00 pm. Instead of blasting your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promotional material</a> to every passerby who may or may not be interested, Optimal GeoSpace can help you determine when your target audience's foot traffic increases and when they area primed to receive a notification about your happy hour. Maybe your ideal customers take a long lunch nearby, so sending them a discount notice during lunch may increase your happy hour attendance. Maybe your restaurant falls on peoples' commute home, so an invitation to escape rush hour with discounted drinks may serve your needs better. Optimal GeoSpace boosts location-based <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">direct marketing techniques</a> by refining real-time data so you can narrow your messaging and timing to reach the potential customers you want when they want it.</span></p>

<h2><b>Business planning and investing with Optimal GeoSpace: </b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As your business expands, Optimal GeoSpace can also help you determine where to branch out. In the same way that this technology tells you when your customers are ready to receive a discount, Optimal GeoSpace can help you identify other areas where your customers are naturally congregating and conducting business. This type of information will help you perform business forecasting that will determine whether an investment (or even rental or leasing price) is worthwhile for a particular venture or expansion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Optimal GeoSpace can help you choose the best place to open a business so that your location fits your natural business model by highlight people that behave the way your best customers do. Once you've found pockets of like-minded customers, you can expand your business to meet and greet them, rather than waiting for them to discover you.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Knowledge is power. And Optimal GeoSpace gives you deeper, more meaningful insights to understand your customers and satisfy their needs. It can give you a leg up on your competitors and help you plan for the future more carefully. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/marketing-research/""><span class=""s2"">Click here</span></a> to learn more about the variety of analytics and insights tools our team uses to take your business to the next level.</span></p>",,9/23/2016 8:30,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Optimal-GeoSpace.jpg,business-care-optimal-geospace,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
5 reasons why Twitter is NOT obsolete for tourism marketing,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Despite finding it’s way into the presidential debate, onto national news, investigative reporting, and into our workplaces (come on, when’s the last time you went to a marketing conference without a Twitter hashtag?), Twitter sometimes gets a bad wrap. Twitter may not be the most lucrative <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media platform</a> in terms of the company’s own raw revenue, but it does have a unique, indelible place in our social media ecosystem. And this is especially true for tourism marketing experts. Here’s why.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Reason 1.  Twitter attracts tourism marketing experts:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Twitter often attracts specialists due to the conversational nature of the platform. Likeminded individuals and experts can easily find each other using a simple hashtag or searching by specific jargon. Unlike other social media platforms that require you to link accounts with someone before you can interact with them, Twitter encourages open connection and discussion. Top tastemakers and reviewers suddenly have real, human access to the most coveted chefs, destination authorities, and tourism officials. And potential travelers have a front row seat to the conversation (and can even get in on the action). If you are hoping to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">truly connect with influencers</a>, Twitter is a great place to catch their attention by reaching out directly and engaging with them in conversations where they are already participating. This is especially valuable for new destinations and growing brands because, according to Social Media Today, customers are more than 44% more likely to discover a new tourism destination on Twitter than any other social media platform. It’s where you go if you want insider, in-the-know information.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Reason 2. Twitter aggregates many geo-location platforms:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because Twitter links to almost every geo-based social media platform (think: FourSquare, Instagram, Facebook, Vine and more), it has become the great aggregator of location-centric marketing. It’s no surprise that tourism destinations such as Greece and Iceland are rising to the top of every trendy travel channel when Twitter is literally inundated with check-ins, geo-tagged photos, and live tweets from these destinations. You simply can’t ignore the slow influx of a certain trend when you see it all in one place. And the more your destination is seen, the more it will be top of mind when your customers are ready to book their next trip. But you don’t need to passively wait for your destination to become popular. Search for trends near your region or in your niche market that might help you differentiate your brand from the competition and run with it. A few years ago, for example, molecular gastronomy took the Riviera Maya by storm. Emerging hotel chains, such as Karisma Hotel’s Azul and El Dorado Resorts, jumped on the trend and began tweeting about their offerings to the excitement of many foodies and tourism experts. Today, they are known as the #gourmetinclusive all-inclusive alternative focusing on good food and inclusive service. What will your next hashtag be?</span></p>

<h2><strong>Reason 3. Communication is the king of tourism marketing:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At its heart, tourism marketing is a service industry. That means that providing good customer service when your destination is at its best – and worst – can literally make or break your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand image</a>. Unlike email (with routine 12-24 hour wait times) and customer service hotlines (that always seem to be experiencing “unusually high call volumes”), Twitter presents an opportunity for near instantaneous communication and gratification. When a flight is delayed or your bags are lost and no one at the service desk seems to be able to help, Twitter becomes an outlet to vent frustrations. When you receive the best massage of your life and simply need to share a humble brag, Twitter becomes the perfect platform to let your follows know sp-ahhh time was awesome. Over 70% of customers who cite tweeting (both good and bad) say they felt better afterward. We believe this is because many companies monitor their Twitter accounts and are in practice of responding to customers. It’s a great service tool for one of the most critical service industries and should never be overlooked when building your customer outreach strategy.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Reason 4. You can let the tools do the work for you:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Some marketers are under the impression that Twitter requires a substantial amount of work because the livestream conversation never stops. This, however, could not be farther from the truth. Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use when mining customer insights or scheduling content. There are countless social listening tools that tap directly into your Twitter feed, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">numerous analytics</a> and reach measurement tools tracking your Tweet exposure, and even more scheduling and retweeting tools that allow you to wrap up your content in one neat package and have it sent into the internet at your allocated time. You can even retweet other peoples’ content if you don’t have time to generate your own. Twitter is an open source of information about your customers, your competitors, and your industry – and it’s often free to collect this information. The simple fact is that Twitter makes it easy for you to use and mine insights from the platform, so it would be silly not to take advantage of the opportunity.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Reason 5. Because your competitors have it:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Chances are, your competitors have Twitter accounts. And if they don’t, they should. There is no reason not to have a Twitter presence and most businesses understand that even if they don't invest fervently in the platform. Thus, if you aren’t keeping pace with your competition, this is a missed opportunity. Naturally, if you are ahead of the curve and your competition hasn't caught on yet, this is good news for you too. Twitter may not be your primary marketing focus, but posting and retweeting between 3-6 tweets a day (something that could take an hour or two of scheduling for the whole month if you know the types of content you want to expose), can have a real and meaningful impact.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">No matter what your reasons are, we can’t think of many reasons why Twitter isn’t valuable for hospitality and tourism professionals. Tourism marketing has a unique opportunity to benefit from Twitter’s influential sphere and to keep your brand top of mind for potential customers. ... And as we mentioned in our previous blog post about how to engage customers in new and meaningful ways (<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/keep-your-company-culture-in-a-growing-business/""><span class=""s2"">click here</span></a> for more on that), this is the key to success.  </span></p>",,10/4/2016 9:30,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/5-Reasons-Why-Twitter-Is-Not-Obsolete-for-Tourism.jpg,twitter-not-obsolete-tourism-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
4 marketing secrets to increase customer engagement in hospitality,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Having an amazing destination or an amazing hotel isn’t enough to keep today’s jet set consumers coming back to your property for their annual vacation anymore. There are simply too many other enticing options vying for their attention and disposable income. But as US unemployment rates drop to the lowest they’ve been in close to eight years and the average wages skip past historic highs, there will be more revenue to go around for everyone. The rise of picture-based <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a> such as Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook have made it easier than ever for travelers to virtually explore new destinations, plan trips that fit their budget, and delve into new tourism options. As a result, the tourism and hospitality market is expanding – which is good news for you. To remain competitive, you simply need to remain relevant. Hospitality Marketing and engaging with new and existing customers online is an incredible way to pique their interest in your destination and help increase your reach to new audiences. The trick is: how?</span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Constantly seek new audiences to invigorate your hospitality marketing: </span></strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media to engage new audiences</a> (not just those users who are already interested in your brand) and create a bridge between your tried-and-tested marketing campaigns with your point-of-sale experience. Blog posts, customer references, social listening, contests, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">social influencers</a> are all lynch pins when increasing your reach to new audiences. It’s especially important that all your channels complement each other so that no matter how new prospective customers discover your brand, they are receiving a seamless, on-point experience.</span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Measure everything: </span></strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Measure everything. We simply can’t say it enough. Before you generate or release any creative content, consider your goals and what you want success to look like. This will help you craft the appropriate call to action for each activity. With a bevy of data tools to choose from - from Twitter, Google and Facebook analytics, Klout, and HootSuite, to more robust platforms such as Adobe <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">Analytics</a> and Campaign Manager - you can track almost any output in the digital world. As certain channels and entry points prove valuable, you can begin investing more in those areas. This systematic measuring allows you to make decisions in a world where your customers expect you to be everywhere they are … even if you haven’t met them yet.</span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Intelligently invest in your hospitality marketing: </span></strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While returning guests are the bread and butter of any business, they should be part of your maintenance strategy – not necessarily your growth strategy. Methodically invest in high-impact marketing tools by testing new channels and entry points in a way that won’t expose your business to too much risk. For ideas on how to test new ideas that will break through the clutter and keep your marketing materials fresh and engaging without overexposing yourself, partner closely with a creative, multi-platform agency like our team of Orlando marketing experts. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Click here</a> to see how we have helped customers like you add new to their foundational marketing plans.  </span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Pay attention to new hospitality marketing trends:</span></strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> In that vein, don’t be afraid to try new things. The hospitality industry is constantly changing, and your marketing techniques should reflect those changes. Social media is often a “safe space” to introduce new ideas, survey your audience regarding potential product or service enhancements, and gain customer insights about experimental ideas. The tourism industry, perhaps more so than any other, is constantly changing as new ideas and trends enter the market, so keep up.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Embracing new audiences, setting goals, investing in new techniques, and staying on top of emerging trends are all ways to keep your customer base engaged with your brand and eager to visit you again and again. Our team is here to help create a comprehensive marketing plan that allows you to do all of these things with ease. Give us a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/""><span class=""s2"">call</span></a> today to find out how. </span></p>",,10/6/2016 9:44,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Marketing-Secrets-to-Increase-Customer-Engagement.jpg,4-marketing-secrets-increase-customer-engagement-hospitality-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Multi-channel marketing meets tourism & hospitality,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The need for strategic, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing</a> has never been more apparent than in the tourism and hospitality industries. Consider these two facts:</span></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Two-thirds of both offline and online purchases begin on a mobile device. That is to say that the initial research or product discovery occurs on consumers’ smartphones or tablets.</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">61% of purchases that start on a mobile device are completed on a different digital device such as a laptop.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When you also consider that the average vacation purchase cycle takes 30-days or more (usually overseen by the female head of household even if she isn’t the primary provider), that leaves a lot of room for your would-be customers to slip in and out of the purchase journey. Don’t let your customers’ natural switch between devices while conducting research, comparing options, and weighing the value of this large-scale purchase, all the while marching through this long-tail sales experience be a recipe for missed opportunities.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Leverage multi-channel marketing in the tourism industry:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Instead, use this reality as an opportunity to create a tailored, multi-channel marketing strategy that blurs lines between devices to enhance – rather than fracture – the shopping experience. According to Forbes, “the vast majority of media interactions are screen-based and so marketing strategies should no longer be viewed as ‘digital’ or ‘traditional’”. And we couldn’t agree more. People are constantly consuming media from their smartphones, computers, email inboxes, televisions, and radios. Trying to keep them separate or hoping to shepherd customers through one, sole channel is simply not realistic.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tourism marketing hinges on our ability to translate the perceived value of a wholly emotional purchase, which is why it is especially important to reach your customers at exactly the right moments. Retargeting, campaigns that encourage device switching (such as a contest that draws customers from a television spot to your Facebook page), or carefully placed emails and banners can all make this task easier.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Invest smarter, not harder in tourism marketing:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Creating a strategy that touches the most likely places your customers will be starts with data. Most marketers can’t be everywhere at once, so it’s important to invest in the right channels at the right times so your messaging reaffirms your brand values and the unique experience your destination affords. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">Your local Orlando marketing agency</a> can help with that. There’s no need to reinvent (or reinvest in) the wheel when agency partners like us have access to a wealth of market and behavioral research that can guide and direct these types of decisions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Make decisions that maximize your reach without maxing out your marketing budget by observing your customers and competitors. Social media, in particular, is a great way to glean information about what your customers are interested in if you need quick insights. Also consider what your competitors are doing. If you want to take them on head-to-head, plan your budget accordingly. If not, think about where these same customers are congregating that they aren’t.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Multi-channel marketing allows you to succeed in a hyper-competitive world with blurred digital lines and fierce pricing strategy. And it’s much easier than you think. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative/""><span class=""s2"">Click here</span></a> to learn more about the types of creative services we offer and how we have helped our clients bridge their media needs with ease.</span></p>",,10/8/2016 10:14,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Multi-Channel-Marketing.jpg,multi-channel-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Augmented reality check: How AR will change the tourism industry,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We can appreciate that some tourism marketers are hesitant to fully embrace augmented reality. It has the power to change the industry as we know it. And while we don’t buy into the most seemingly farfetched fears that we might end up in a Matrix-like world in which humans experience their world from behind a computer screen, we understand the sentiment. Instead of resisting this change, we recommend embracing it. Like the advent of robotic service providers that can bring towels, store luggage, or prepare meals for guests (thus eliminating the need for some hospitality roles) – the future is unavoidable. Instead of fearing these changes and risking the obsolescence of your tourism destination, find ways to integrate these new technologies with your existing service model.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Augmented reality can complement not replace tourism marketing:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are unlimited ways that augmented reality could enhance your guests’ tourism experience. AR can help new travelers decide what type of trip is best for them (Is flying really that terrifying? Is cruising for me? Will I prefer a safari or a ski trip?). It can help them vet destinations and hotel or restaurant choices. And it can tease entertainment options that might seem like a splurge (until you experience them that is). Notice, it’s called augmented reality not alternative reality. We’re pretty sure a cross-continental flight that provides an oh-so-convenience excuse not to check work emails is enough to draw tourists from even the most farflung reaches of the globe. And in a world that is increasingly “on,” experiences are a valuable currency that lets us unplug, recharge, and connect with the world around us. Augmented reality can simply help make the preparation around these experiences more convenience.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Similarly, augmented reality could help alleviate logistic difficulties certain tourism destinations face. Whether your target audience has a language barrier, navigation challenges, or spotty internet and cell service, augmented reality can help prepare tourists for their trip and give them tools to navigate or seek assistance while on the go. This might be especially valuable for the business traveler who doesn’t quite know how to spend her freetime or who is unsure how to get to her next on-site meeting.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Augmented reality is the next best thing to tourism marketing:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That said, for those individuals who simply can’t afford to travel or take a two week vacation, augmented reality can provide a unique paid outlet for tourism destinations to monetize virtual trips to their location. We know, that doesn't sound all that glamorous; but it is a win-win situation for those individuals who could now take park in experiences that were previously out of reach and for industry providers who will benefit from this trend. In the same way that television hasn’t replaced books or radio, we believe that augmented reality does not need to replace tourism, but can become an extension or alternative. To extend this metaphors one step farther farther: even if we’ve read the book, sometimes the movie is just as enjoyable. A trip using AR doesn't necessarily mean there won't be a physical trip, but it could if you jus tweed the Cliff's Notes version in a pinch.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Augmented reality can preserve and promote tourism marketing:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you've ever visited South East Asia and climbed through the ancient ruins of Cambodia's Angkor Wat, you might have wondered how long the tourism destination will continue to allow visitors access to nearly all parts of these incredible temples. Augmented reality gives us the tools to preserve historic landmarks that should be off limits to protect their beauty for generations to come. In the most fragile sections of the temple, tourism officials could offer an augmented reality exhibit of the relief sculptures rather than full tourist access. Paintings that are light or temperature sensitive could not be seen, dangerous caves could now be accessible, and so forth. The same is also true in war torn countries where tourism has become less popular due to local unrest. Countries such as Egypt, Turkey and even Israel could continue to promote and share their unique experiences in times when some travelers may be hesitant to visit. And we'd like to think that's one small step closer to repairing our global community.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Reenergize local attractions with augmented reality: </strong></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even if you aren't an exotic tourism destination, experimenting with augmented reality sets your brand apart and will allow you to adapt to changes as they occur, while promoting local exploration and discovery. Encourage your regional community to learn about their homes in new and unique ways be drawing them through a historic neighborhood with augmented reality attractions. Make local educational sites more interesting, and promote local businesses by harnessing AR's navigational tools. At even the smallest levels, AR apps and smartphone pairings can provide new business marketing tools to expose local gems that make your community unique.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We realize that some of these attractions aren't quite here yet, but they are coming. Prepare now by priming your current multi-channel marketing strategy for the next phase of digital marketing and beyond. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/""><span class=""s2"">Contact us</span></a>, we are here to help with any questions you may have about this so called, ""augmented reality.""</span></p>",,10/10/2016 10:20,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Augmented-Reality-Check.jpg,augmented-reality-will-change-tourism-industry,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why you need to include video marketing in your tourism outreach,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We've shared our views on why v<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">ideo marketing and production</a> matters more than ever before and how tourism marketing can benefit from video in the past. For our ""why video 101"" blog posts, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/video-production-101/""><span class=""s2"">click here</span></a>. And, for our advanced readers who are already on the trend, we want to take things one step farther.</span></p>

<h2>Videos link channels across tourism marketing outreach</h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When customers receive an email with an embedded video link, they are 200% more likely to click the links. Go ahead, reread that: 200% more likely to click your email. Video is such an engaging medium that it has the power to link multiple marketing channels together and bridge the gap between <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social</a>, paid, search, television, and even <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print ads</a>. You'll find your customers seamlessly migrating between your Facebook campaigns and your YouTube channel. They'll happily log online to see the next installment of a television commercial <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">with a great narrative</a>. A teasing hashtag is enough to make them close their magazine and log onto Instagram. And then they'll share it all. The reason video is so effective in this way is because it allows marketers to tell a story with their brand and communicate their value proposition through words and images. Video is easy for consumers to digest and also easy for marketers to implement across a wide variety of channels. This winning combo allows you to leverage some great b-roll footage across your diverse marketing efforts to create a true end-to-end marketing experience that customers love.</span></p>

<h2>Video marketing lets you be everywhere customers need you to be</h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Today's consumer often starts their purchase journey on one device and ends (or purchases) somewhere else. This is especially true in tourism marketing. Device agnostic marketing techniques are becoming more and more important as customers use their smartphones, tablets, laptops, and televisions to solve everyday problems all at the same time. That's four screens competing for your customers' attention at any given moment. To ensure success, you need to be on all four screens. And before you protest and say that this would be too expensive, consider the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">power of video marketing</a>. Aside from being a top-notch visceral cue for tourism marketing customers, video translates easily across screens and mediums, allowing you to be everywhere at once ... Without the hefty price tag to go along with it. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">Good video production</a> allows you to be everywhere your customers expect you to be regardless of where they are at in your purchase journey.</span></p>

<h2>Tourism marketing is a visual industry at its core</h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We would be remiss not to remind you that video marketing is one of the most engaging mediums available to the tourism industry. Nothing affirms a customer's choice in your destination or hotel like seeing your views, exploring your guest rooms, or taking in the sights and sounds of your kitchens from the comfort of their own home. Video helps build engagement and excitement, while leveraging the fundamental emotions necessary to inspire an elective purchase such as a vacation or tourism visit. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-post-production-services/"">Video marketing</a> is, without a doubt, the most powerful way to capture your prospective audience's imagination and entice them to learn more about your brand and commit to their next trip.</span></p>

<h2>Video is a critical investment for tourism marketing</h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At the end of the day, video is also just a good investment. When you do it right, one long video can be spliced into multiple short spots and teasers, you can pull still images from high quality footage, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">edit your roll a hundred different ways</a> to support a variety of campaigns, messaging points, website needs, and sales tools. Old video can often be combined with new footage as elements of your destination evolve, so this initial investment can last for years to come (unlike photos that tend to wear out their welcome in one to two years). Let our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">creative team of video production</a> efforts help you build a shot list, story board, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">video narrative</a> that will adapt to your changing needs across a wide range of channels. Together, we'll set a budget and production schedule that delights and inspires. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Check out some of the amazing videos we've created for our other clients here and then let's get started. As we near the end of the year, there's no better time to introduce a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">video campaign</a> to inspire sales moving toward 2017.</span></p>",,10/12/2016 10:43,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Why-You-Need-to-Include-Video-Marketing-in-Your-Tourism.jpg,video-marketing-tourism-outreach,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Call us crazy: We're not afraid of ad blocking. Are You?,"A lot of businesses and marketers are worried about the growing efficiency of (and access to) ad blocking technology. In fairness, with over 144 million people using ad blockers, according to IMB, this might be a cause for concern if your primary advertising strategy relies on banner ads and CPC campaigns. We might sound crazy, but we're not worried. In fact, we think the rise of ad blocking technology is a good thing. Let us tell you why.
<h2>IT'S WHAT YOUR CUSTOMERS WANT:</h2>
We know you're in business to make money. We also happen to be marketers, so we're right there with you. But ads can be annoying and distracting. It's hard to admit, but we all know it's true. And so do your customers -- the heart and soul of your business. At the very least, you are a consumer too, so unless you've chosen to opt-in to every single pop up or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video</a> ad that's interrupted your web browsing, this probably isn't a shock to you.

When the internet was first created, banner ads were an easy way to reach new audiences and grow business. Today, in a world that's constantly connected, the deluge of ads can feel overwhelming. As business owners and advertisers, we can't rest on our laurels. What worked in the past isn't going to work in the future. We need to adapt to the reality that people may always be online, but they don't want to be bombarded with ads 24/7.

Finding ways to reach people with the right information at the right time creates a better customer experience for three reasons.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>It decreases bounce</strong>: <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">Digital advertising</a> sometimes uses a ""spray and pray"" method. Even the most targeted ads don't always reach the right people or touch them when they are ready to buy. Increased ad blocking means when you DO get your customers attention, you have a better chance of actually keeping it because the recipient is open to receiving your information. Quality over quantity.</li>
 	<li><strong>It ups engagement</strong>: Ad blocking itself won't increase engagement, but finding <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">new ways to reach your audience</a> - whether that's through native advertising, blog posts, social endorsements, or event marketing - will. If you are truly trying to reach the right people at the right time, it's time to invest in communication that has a real impact. And chances are, that might not exclusively involve banner ads.</li>
 	<li><strong>It builds relationships</strong>: If your customers know your brand delivers value when you communicate with them, you are more likely to cultivate a genuine, trusting relationship with those shoppers. Less than 35% of people trust advertising over peer recommendations, so use the rise of ad blocking as an excuse to cultivate real relationships and build confidence in your brand through more trusted channels.</li>
</ol>
<h2>HOW YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AD BLOCKING:</h2>
The bottom line is that ad blocking isn't going away. It's only increasing. Take advantage of ad blocking by complementing your current marketing strategy with more organic marketing techniques. Your team of Orlando marketing experts here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> can help.

Then, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">contact us</a> to help you prioritize your digital assets so they can be reused and installed across different platforms and mediums.

The only four things you need to know about tourism analytics,"Tourism analytics are a real asset for tourism-based businesses. Data can help you understand seasonal trends, know what your competition is doing, and support your customers' purchase and planning process. Everyone has suggestions on what to track, what tools are best, and how to link it to your business insights.

The good news is, there isn't a one size fits all recipe. There is so much data that you can track almost anything today. We want to share the only four things you need to know when <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">building an analytics program</a> for tourism marketing rather than getting caught up in the tools and processes.
<h2><strong>Figure out what you're trying to understand: </strong></h2>
First and foremost, decide what you want to learn. Depending on your business model, you might not need to collect every piece of data about your customers. For example, the Ritz Carlton is known for impeccable service, personalized experiences, and white-glove attentiveness. They decided to harness data to their customer management system to track trends in food and beverage, tastes and preferences, and expectations. They use this data to personalize the service delivery experience when guests are on site. You might decide you'd like to understand how your customers navigate between mobile and desktop sites, how long the sales cycle lasts and what assets they need during that time, or how to price competitively in your market. Knowing what metrics are most important will work best for you starts with defining the problem you hope to solve. Start there, and the rest of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">your data strategy will develop more</a> naturally.
<h2><strong>Realize that you can't do it all: </strong></h2>
Focus on the big swings. This is especially important if you are just building your data program. With so much insight available, it's easy to try to do too many things at once. Work with your data team or a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">trusted marketing agency </a>like ours to prioritize your data needs based on level of effort and impact. A good rule of thumb is to start with low hanging fruit (this might include things such as site heuristics, quick UX and content updates online, or mobile integrations).

This gives you time to formulate a problem and hopefully find its answer based in data. When choosing what metrics to track, always double check that that KPI relates back to a question you have about your business or client base. And don't forget to pare down your strategy. To start, choose one to three things to track and work on each quarter. If you find this is easy, ramp it up; but start small to ensure you get results from your investment.
<h2><strong>Learn and act fast: </strong></h2>
Many <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketers</a> joke that ROI is out --- and speed to market is in. While we still think ROI is an important metric to keep an eye on, we agree that action is key. Tourism and hospitality are ever changing industries where customers tastes shift as new trends emerge and new technology changes how we travel and interact with the world. Don't collect data for the sake of collecting data and know what you want to do with it. Before tracking any given metric, create a hypothesis of what you think might be happening and how you would address it if data proves you right. That last part is critical. If you don't have a plan for how you want to use this information, you're simply collecting observations rather than insights; And that won't help your business.
<h2><strong>Invest in the future: </strong></h2>
Because you might not be able to do everything at once, it's important to prioritize your data collection and your data tools. Look ahead to consider the systems you will need in a year, or five years. Even if you opt out of these tools now, it's important to keep them in mind so you don't suddenly find yourself behind your competition. Partnering with a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">data-based agency</a> like BIGEYE is a great way to help prioritize your data investments, tools, and collection roadmap so you are using the data you have and planning for the future effectively (and affordably).

TREND ALERT: The power of pop-up shops & why they work so well,"Pop-up shops are all the rage right now with restaurant incubators as one of the most popular new investment models and traveling retail stores creating tons of buzz. Now it’s time for you to get in on the trend. Implementing a pop-up shop is a lot easier than you think (especially if you have a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com"">great agency partner</a> who can help you execute the amazing experience); So don’t let that be an excuse to not leverage this powerful and trendy marketing tool. Still not sold? Let us help.
<h2>Pop-up shops let you try before you buy … err … invest:</h2>
The overwhelming majority of restaurants go out of business in under three years – not because the concept or cuisine isn’t on point – but because they simply run out of money before they break even. Commercial and retail rent is climbing higher than ever before. And small business owners and startups are being forced to make trade-offs when it comes to expansions and launches. Pop-up shops let entrepreneurs have a little more freedom to test into new markets or locations with lower entry costs. Instead of paying a premium-price for turn-key commercial space or depleting your cash flow on high-impact renovations and staging, a pop-up shop can boost sales, pump up excitement, and prepare for a bigger launch in stages. At worst, you have fewer assets on the line in case the endeavor bottoms out.
<h2>A bang-up buzz building tool:</h2>
If you already have a formal launch in the pipeline, don’t think you can’t take advantage of a pop-up shop. In the time leading up to your launch, mini pop-up shops or traveling teaser booths can keep interest up, generate <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a> for your actual launch, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">identify influencers</a> and tastemakers who can become your customer champions. Pop-up shops also let you expose your concept to markets that might not otherwise organically find your location. Pop-up previews can be a powerful marketing experience that breaks through the clutter in a memorable way. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/work"">Click here</a> to learn about how we have helped other clients balance budget with impact when previewing a new idea.
<h2>Trial and error through pop-up shops:</h2>
Pop-up shops are a great way to test new products, menu items, or ideas without risking your brand reputation or your customers’ expected experience. Businesses can even test into offshoot brands or new markets with all the same low-risk benefits of using pop-up shops to gauge your primary business launch. Look no farther than the food truck industry to see how this concept has worked and can to your advantage. Many popular restaurants started as spinoffs from food trucks and evolved into permanent brick and mortar establishments to satisfy the masses. Pop-ups are a safe space to get the metaphoric recipe right before going live with your main course.
<h2>Create a social media heyday:</h2>
People love events that make them feel “in-the-know” or exclusive. You’ve seen those invites on Facebook: a secret concert with a to-be-announced (TBA) celebrity, featuring TBA food vendors, in a trendy, TBA venue. As the day creeps up, details trickle out. This type of hype is viral, organic gold. And the best way for you to get in on the action (or create your own) is through pop-up shops. Whether you’re doing it alone or partnering with complementary businesses and brands, pop-up concepts are fun and easy to share. They allow you to be anywhere your customers are, and join the social media action at ground zero. And with new live-streaming options on Facebook or apps such as Periscope, there’s no limit to your reach.
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Last, but certainly not least, pop-up shops are fun. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/agency#our-services"">Get in touch</a> with our team today and we’ll show you what we’re talking about.</p>",,10/24/2016 9:36,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TREND-ALERT-THe-power-of-pop-up-shops.jpg,pop-up-shops,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Forget the iPhone 7 - let's talk about the iPhone 10,"We'll admit it. We're nerds. Our office was buzzing with the advent of the iPhone 7 before it even hit shelves. But, if you're a business owner, it's already time to forget about the iPhone 7 and start planning for the iPhone 10. Yes, we said iPhone 10.
<h2>WHAT iPHONE 10?</h2>
You're not wrong. The iPhone 7 just released a month ago ... but the rumor mill is already running with whispers about the next Apple release. 2017 marks the ten-year anniversary of the iPhone, so we are betting that Apple will release something special. And we're not the only ones. All the major tech and Mac blogs are buzzing about what's in store for the next year. Think: a full glass body, enhancements to the already-enhanced iPhone 7 camera, new sizes, wireless charging, and increased performance. In short, a nerd's dream. Apple isn't the only company on the brink of some amazing breakthroughs either. Samsung and Microsoft continue to nip Apple's heels, introducing exciting enhancements such as shatterproof glass, waterproof casings, and night-ready cameras.
<h2></h2>
<h2>WHY DO PHONE RELEASES MATTER TO BUSINESSES?</h2>
If you're wondering why you should care, the answer is simple. Better phones mean the switch from desktop to mobile devices is more prevalent than ever. It means engaging apps like this summer's rave PokémonGo will become the rule rather than the exception. It means that native advertising needs to be more creative and more fierce than ever before - begging people to engage with your content rather than skimming over it. Many companies, even with the best intentions, still haven't fully invested in sound mobile integrations, responsive websites, or digital apps. And we get it. Some businesses might feel like they are just catching up with desktop technology and feeling confident in their web presence. Why upset the apple cart? Other companies just don't have the budget to overhaul what they've already done with mobile-ready updates. Unfortunately, your target audience might not care what your reasons are. You just need to be on the devices and channels they are using, or risk missing out on their business. That makes understanding and anticipating new updates in mobile and smartphone technology critical. Most people spend over five hours per day on their smartphones. That's a whole lot of time to grab their attention. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/agency#our-services"">With our help</a>, your business can do it right.
<h2></h2>
<h2>WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET CAUGHT UP?</h2>
Before the next major smartphone release, it's time to get caught up and prepare for the newest waves of technology. And don't worry, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">we're here to help</a>. Start with these three simple steps.

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Responsive websites:</strong> If you haven't done so already, it's time to get a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">responsive website</a>. This is a simple technology (that can be adapted to most major CMS systems and website templates) to make your website function beautifully and efficiently on every device -- no matter what size. We don't recommend having a separate mobile site from your main website, instead, use this ""shortcut"" to streamline your information and present your most critical points simply and intelligently. There's no need to be daunted by the task. If your website doesn't already have responsive options, our team at <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/website-development"">Bigeye can help you</a> implement this technology on any budget.</li>
 	<li><strong>Consider apps:</strong> <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Apps are the future</a>. And it doesn't matter what industry you're in. Whether you're in retail, healthcare, finance, or hospitality, there's an app for almost every day-to-day use case. If you aren't ready to invest in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">full app development</a> (and the necessary promotion that goes along with it), consider partnering with another local brand that has an app people are already using. There may be an opportunity to share email lists, resources, and audience touch points (like their app) so you both benefit. For example, if you own a local cafe, it might make sense to partner with your local news channel to offer discounts on their news app ... after all, nothing goes better with morning news than a cup of coffee from your baristas, right? Get creative.</li>
 	<li><strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Don't wait until the next iPhone release to start thinking about mobile integrations. We already know that cameras, imagery, and usability are big trends to watch on all the new devices, so consider working with a trusted digital agency like <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/work"">BIGEYE</a> to make sure that you're ready when the release hits. Should your website imagery be better if it will be viewed on a crystal clear screen? Are there apps or engagement opportunities (such as sweepstakes) that could leverage new photo capabilities to complement your business? You get the idea.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Technology releases are the precursor to marketing trends and emerging fads, so lean into the cutting edge and <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">let's work together.</a></p>",,10/19/2016 9:30,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Enlight1-4.jpg,lets-talk-iphone-10,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

Understanding the ROI of employee advocacy programs,"The Wall Street Journal cites the cost of an average Facebook fan at $1.07. Considering that the average Facebook user only sees content from approximately 10% - 20% of the Facebook pages they have liked, we think that’s a little high. And when we consider that the vast majority of individuals trust user-generated content (such as Yelp reviews, peer recommendations, and social shares), we’re even less impressed. This is why a successful employee advocacy program can be one of your most valuable marketing tools.

Assuming that your employees are a reflection of your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/""> brand values</a>, their connections are probably somewhat similar to them and may share some of the same interests and shopping habits as your employees. That means the people who do see your content may be more likely to want to interact with your brand. Lastly, it builds trust. Happy employees are great brand advocates in the making, so let them shine.

To help you get started, here are four simple steps to launch an employee advocacy program.
<h2>Inspire your employees</h2>
The easiest way to launch an employee advocacy program is to inspire your employees to do it themselves. That is to say that they need to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">want to promote your brand</a>. If your employees like working for you, believe in your products and the value of your services, they will be more likely to promote your brand and share their positive experiences on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>. This seems simple, but hiring the right people in the right roles can be tricky. Making sure those same people stay engaged and grow with the organization is equally difficult. Invest in a solid HR program, take time to get to know your employees creating a fun work culture, solicit their feedback about the work environment, AND your products. Then listen.
<h2>Carrot vs. stick</h2>
Incentivize your employees to share positive content. The carrot always wins. Host a competition for most <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">creative social media posts</a>. Include social influence as criteria when considering promotions. Give your employees a gas card or Starbucks certificate for every referral that becomes a client. Whatever works. You can’t make employee advocacy programs mandatory and expect success, but you can encourage your employees to participate by speaking their language and understanding what motivates them to do so.
<h2>Carefully choose content</h2>
Avoid burnout by cherry picking critical content or timely posts you want your employees to share. Even the most enthusiastic employee advocates won’t be willing to constantly share your content, so make sure your ask is meaningful and impactful. This will help your employees see the value in what they’re doing and be more inclined to give it their best shot. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">Focus on special promotions</a>, off-season deals, or right before a product launch. It’s also important to set clear guidelines about the type of content that should be shared and how it should be promoted. Make sure expectations are clear and you are setting your employees – and yourself – up for success.
<h2>Lead by example</h2>
Although you may not be in the habit of connecting with your employees on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media</a>, you can use screenshots of your own outreach as an example or share stories of how your outreach has inspired you or had an impact on your quarterly goals. Your employees should feel comfortable and confident that their privacy is intact, but that everyone is participating equally. This is an especially important gesture of goodwill when you’re asking people to give a personal endorsement on a professional brand.

Why you're missing out by not investing in vector graphics,"If your business isn’t investing in vector graphics, it should be. And we’re going to tell you why. Some advertising agencies don’t want to share why vector images are so powerful because they are concerned of having less work for their creative team if businesses learn to self-serve. We know the value of any agency partnership should extend far beyond campaign churning and burning so we're not worried about giving this information out. We’re here to talk about vector graphics.
<h2>WHAT ARE VECTOR GRAPHICS:</h2>
Vector graphics are perfectly scalable, mathematically-based images and designs that create pictures and logos based on layered shapes, gradients, and patterns. Designers (or business owners), can make images that can be shrunk or enlarged for any print or<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/""> digital work imaginable</a>. The file sizes tend to be smaller and cleaner than enhanced images making sharing, editing, and updating a breeze.
<h2>AS OPPOSED TO WHAT:</h2>
You’ve probably seen vector graphics hundreds of times but didn’t realize it; They look as good as any picture or Photoshop project you can imagine. In fact, many designers work exclusively in vectors since they are much easier to edit than photographic images. This is especially true for logo and icon work. Vectors are created using tools such as Adobe Illustrator (or the free-based Vector software). Unlike photography, vector graphics allow you to create pictures that can be duplicated, recolored, and manipulated with no limitations. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/agency#our-services"">Check out</a> some ways we've helped local businesses do just that.
<h2>WHO CARES:</h2>
This is important for several reasons. First, it creates seamless <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand consistency</a>. Need to change your logo to appear on a dark background versus a light background ? It covers that. Need to adjust the size of your logo to fit on a business card? No problem. Need a web icon that will appear across the site? It's got you covered. Typical image edits a business needs to make on a day-to-day basis are easy to implement using vector graphics. What might take an hour or two on Photoshop usually only takes a few minutes using vectors. Because vectors are easy to edit and scale, you don’t need to worry about accidentally going off brand or radically skewing your image. Every aspect of the image can be easily duplicated or edited down to the very layer.

Vectors are also easy to create. You don’t need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a high-end photoshoot when you can create beautiful images from the comfort of your laptop. It also means you can rely less on generic stock images and more on the creative vision you have for your team. Once you invest in a few great vector graphics, you can repurpose them and edit them for a wide variety of needs giving you the best bang for your buck. Vector images can be customized to your exact liking so you never have to worry about seeing your images on a competitive website or campaign unlike stock photography. And unlike customized photoshoots or artwork, you can cut cost without cutting quality. And <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative"">we can help</a>.
<h2>WHEN TO CALL THE PROS:</h2>
Once you have a foundation of vector images to use, edits are easy. We’re confident any business owner or designer can extend the life and relevancy of your vector graphics across channels and creative needs. But, it’s best to leave that foundation to the pros. If you’re unsure what types of vectors would be most useful, <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">give us a call.</a> We’ll help you determine how you plan to use your vectors, what types of edits might be most common to your business, and what your key assets should be. We can build the start of our creative foundation together to use for your brand guidelines, campaign needs, and beyond.",,10/28/2016 10:30,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Vector-graphics.jpg,missing-business-without-vector-graphics,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
When did biometric monitoring become a real marketing tool,"Biometric measurements are being used by some of today’s most savvy and forward thinking marketers. You’ve probably even experienced biometric marketing without thinking twice about it. Think: Snapchat’s facial filters that conveniently transport you into a cool, new nightclub or morph your face into the villain from this Halloween’s creepiest thriller. Those are all biometric marketing techniques to get you to notice and connect deeper with a brand or product.

At <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">BIGEYE</a>, we believe it’s important to stay ahead of the competition because you simply can’t reach everyone at once. Instead, by engaging with those you do, you’ll boost chances of creating a meaningful and mutually beneficial customer relationship. Here’s how you can start preparing for the increasing use of biometric marketing:
<h2>HOW YOU CAN USE BIOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS TODAY:</h2>
There are a few easy ways to use biometric measurements to your advantage today. The amazing part is that these tools are highly effective, but relatively low tech to implement.

1. <strong>Eye tracking software:</strong> Eye tracking monitors the movement and focus of users eyes as it relates to various pictures, products, or website elements. Scientists have been able to create an eye tracking algorithm over the years. It mimics what the average eye will do when scanning your advertisement or website. Companies, such as EyeQuant, are able to scan your creative assets with 80-90% accuracy and highlight what the average user would focus on. You can even adjust the filter to see what a first time visitor might look at versus what a brand-familiar user might focus on. Eye tracking helps you highlight issues with your user experience and information architecture quickly and easily in order to prioritize your creative updates. This is especially helpful for website testing and quick site fixes.

2. <strong>Body language and facial expression analysis:</strong> These tools aren’t just helpful in criminal investigations. Body language and facial expression <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">analysis</a> allow marketers to understand the emotional response to your creative assets. This qualitative insight can help you understand whether what customers are feeling matches what they say, and capture first impressions. One of the easiest and best ways to accomplish this is by hiring a biometric expert to sit in on a focus group experience. You can ask a small group of customers or would be customers to participate in a focus group. There your face and body language expert assesses their responses and behavior.
<h2>WHAT’S NEXT FOR BIOMETRIC MONITORING:</h2>
If you’re in the tourism and hospitality, retail, or security industry, staying on the cutting edge of biometric monitoring is especially important. These industries rely on our ability to accurately understand and identify human emotion or behavior. As biometric monitoring becomes more routine, it will help dramatically improve and enhance the customer service experience. Biometric monitoring allows us to anticipate our customers’ needs and serve them experiences they will genuinely enjoy.

Why your business should care about lookalike targeting,"Has a friend ever asked you what you think of their new girlfriend and found yourself at a loss for words because she looks exactly like their ex? You’re not alone. The reason is that people are predictable. As humans, we tend to gravitate toward what is familiar. People who share our values and trends that aren’t too far from what we already know and like. As marketers, though, this is a very good thing.

Lookalike targeting allows you to take advantage of this by marketing to audiences that behave similarly to your most valuable customers. This increases the chances of these customers noticing and engaging with your brand. Because we can’t be everywhere at once, or market to every audience effectively, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">lookalike targeting</a> allows you to go after your most likely wins first and invest resources in the most likely path of success.
<h2>FIRST, WHAT IS LOOKALIKE TARGETING:</h2>
Because past performance is the best indication of future success, lookalike targeting serves content to potential customers who are searching, surfing, and interacting in similar ways to your target audience. Similar search patterns won’t necessarily cause customers to purchase your products, but the expectation is that these users are similar enough to your actual customers. This means they might be interested in your brand. Lookalike targeting also seeks out audiences who fall into similar <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">sociodemographic</a> categories that might serve as a benchmark weeding tool to ensure your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">messaging is reaching the right people</a>. For example, if your brand targets pregnant women, simple lookalike targeting reaches women similar to your customers - likely between the ages of 20-50. They are searching similar baby brands on social media and far more likely to purchase than open advertising campaigns.
<h2>IS THIS LEGAL AND HOW CAN I GET IN ON THE ACTION:</h2>
Lookalike targeting is completely legal. Facebook’s ads manager allows you to very specifically and effectively engage in lookalike targeting with costs in line along with other advertising options. Thanks to the growing popularity of social sign on (an option where people can sign up for websites or newsletters with their social media accounts rather than entering their email and a password), we have the ability to track who is surfing for what even once they leave your site.

A customer might sign on to their favorite blog using their Facebook account, and then log on to Amazon using that same Facebook account. And Facebook aggregates it all. People are willing to forgo a level of privacy for the convenience and efficiency of social sign on. But there’s nothing nefarious going on here. The more we know about our web traffic, the better, more relevant content we can serve them. Which makes the browsing experience better all around.
<h2>HOW WE CAN HELP:</h2>
Once you have an amazing, primed audience you need to serve them amazing content. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">We’ll help you</a> strike a balance between being too similar to your competition, but not so dissimilar that you lose these lookalikes’ interest. Audience is a big part of the equation, but content is still king (and always will be). Lookalike targeting is great for businesses on a budget to ensure you’re getting the most out of your marketing efforts without wasting money talking to people who will likely never buy your products. It’s a way to be everywhere you need to be, without trying to be everywhere at once, and a great way to give yourself a little competitive advantage.

Be on top of your game: Learn Ruby on Rails today,"Today, some magnet schools are teaching computer coding as a second language the way we learned French and Spanish. And it makes sense. Code is swiftly becoming the universal language for success no matter what country or industry you’re in.

For those of us who didn’t grow up with mandatory computer science classes, it can feel overwhelming to catch up on the latest trends and industry expectations. But don’t worry – <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">we have you covered.</a>

Ruby on Rails is a trendy web application framework that lets you quickly and easily create scalable, fully-functional web components that will power your business. Want a real world example? AirBnb, Indigogo, Hulu and over 1.2 million other websites have already been on top of this trend.
<h2>WAIT, WHAT IS A WEB APPLICATION FRAMEWORK?</h2>
Let’s backup. If HTML builds the picture frame that holds your website together and standardizes the look and feel of your site in accordance with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand guidelines,</a> <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">web applications</a> fill in the canvas. Think: pop ups, animations, automatic updates, video frames, and other interactive elements.

JavaScript is one of the most popular coding languages used to build web application frameworks that integrate with other elements on your site (such as your HTML and CSS). Ruby on Rails is giving Java a run for its money.
<h2>TELL ME MORE ABOUT RUBY ON RAILS:</h2>
Ruby on Rails was created in Japan several years ago, but has steadily grown in popularity, finally making it to the top of many 2016 trend lists. The reason? Developing on Ruby is faster (let’s say than JavaScript) and it’s free.

The program’s open source base also makes plugging in integrations such as Google Analytics, customer management tools, and other e-commerce tools a breeze.

Most importantly, Ruby is a full-stack framework, which means your front-end code (a.k.a how things look) and your back end code (a.k.a how things work) all sync with code built using Ruby so you don’t have to create nearly as much code to make things do <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">what you want them to do on your website</a>.
<h2>BUT HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM JAVASCRIPT?</h2>
If your team is already using JavaScript or .NET code and wondering whether switching your development language would be more work than its worth, consider this. Two big differentiators that make Ruby on Rails shine are its built-in- testing feature and intelligent convention naming.

Save time on the debugging and QA process with Ruby’s automated testing. This alone will save you plenty of headaches and maybe even a few QA salary dollars. And your developers will love you for it.

They will also love that they don’t need to write pages and pages of configuration code to clarify their work. Ruby provides suggested naming conventions that significantly reduces, and in some case eliminates, the need for time spent writing configuration code. Remember: time is money.
<h2>GET TO THE BOTTOM LINE:</h2>
You need to learn (or encourage your team to learn Ruby on Rails) if:

1. You are a newcomer to writing code and want to choose something that will be worth the effort and valuable for years to come.

2. Your site is outdated and needs an update (like, transitioning to a responsive site).

3. You have a lean team and need to find ways to increase speed to market without compromising quality. Let our team help you prioritize the types of web framework applications that will be most valuable to your brand and bring your team up to speed on this exciting new trend.

Don’t miss the January deadline for Google expanded text ads,"Originally slated for October 26, 2016, Google announced they will be extending their deadline to migrate to their new, expanded text ads program to January 31, 2017. If you’re asking yourself what Google expanded text ads, we’re glad you’re here.

On January 31, you will no longer be able to edit or create ads using Google’s original ad format, which features a 25-character headline, and two 35-character sub-headlines. Instead, all your ads will adopt a new format, which includes two 30-character headlines and an 80-character body text block.
<h2>THIS IS A GOOD THING, RIGHT?</h2>
Generally speaking, the switch is a good thing. Google’s new ads were designed with the mobile user in mind so they could more quickly and easily gather information about an ad to determine <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">whether a click was worthwhile</a>. There are a few other nuances, such as enhancements to the display URL; and the addition of optional path fields, that make presenting information more simple for businesses.

For example, instead of confusing users with complicated URLs that link to your campaign landing pages or micro-sites, this new format will simply show your parent website (e.g., <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">www.bigeyeagency.com</a>) even if you are linking to a specific subpage (e.g. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">www.bigeyeagency.com/LandingPage</a>).

Similarly, path fields give you the opportunity to send your customers directly to information you know they need (e.g., “shop”, “reservations”, “contact”, or “about us”) rather than sending them to your main site where they need to click into these sub pages. The good news is; it isn’t an either/or decision. Google’s new ad format let’s you do both.
<h2>SO WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?</h2>
You need to get on this because you can’t assume that the new ad format will perform better than your old text ads even though there is more text space. Which means, it’s time to start doing some A/B testing. Aided, of course, by our three step, fast and furious ad testing guide:

1. <strong>Aim for an apples-to-apples comparison:</strong> Test a successful version of an old, shorter ad against a similar variation in the new format. Even though you have more real estate with the extended ad format, try to keep the text in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">your initial test variations</a> as similar as possible so you can determine whether the format itself will have an impact on your ad performance (rather than the content). This gives you a clean baseline to test moving  forward.

2. <strong>Keep your control:</strong> Because you don’t have long to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">test these ads</a> before the January deadline, you might be tempted to ditch your original control and start testing on the new format alone to accelerate learnings. Do. Not. Do. This. You’ll have plenty of time to test variations of the new format against itself once the deadline hits. For now, the goal is to optimize what has been successful in the past. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">Test your best</a> (and even worst) past ads against the new format to get as close to or better than those results.

3. <strong>Test multiple versions at once:</strong> Depending on your ad keywords and your expected traffic, you might not reach statistical testing significance if you run multiple test variations at once; but you want to make sure you have as much data as possible (even if its directional) moving toward that January deadline. In this instance, we’d rather see  you test more variations to gain a variety of early insights rather than hitting the deadline with only one perfect test in hand. But if it must be only one perfect test, make sure it’s the apples-to-apples comparison we mentioned.

Our team can quickly set up a few extended ad tests and prioritize your spend for next year so 2017 is the best yet.</p>",,11/8/2016 11:00,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/google-expands-text-ads.jpg,google-expanded-text-ads,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Stop ignoring Gmail sponsored promotions in your inbox,"We know that Google is doing a lot of exciting stuff: extended ad formats and changes to AdWords paid advertising format, to name a few. But that shouldn’t mean that we ignore Google’s amazing Gmail Sponsored Promotions (GSP).

When you <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">partner with BIGEYE</a>, we help you prioritize when to invest in each of these opportunities. Also, how to adapt to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">target audience’s</a> needs so you can serve them the right information at the right time. Gmail Sponsored Promotions are especially important for consumer and retail organizations.

This is especially important now that Google has finally opened up GSP to any and all advertisers. After two years in the beta testing phase, the sky is finally the limit. As you start planning your 2017 <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy,</a> don’t miss this trend.
<h2>UNDERSTANDING GMAIL SPONSORED PROMOTIONS:</h2>
GSP look and function a lot like email by popping into your customers’ personal Gmail inboxes like your latest <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing campaigns</a> … except they aren’t emails.

GSP are actually cost-per-click (CPC) ads disguised as emails to increase engagement and reach users who may be primed to shop while checking their mail. These ads are always filtered into the “promotions” tab on users’ desktop Gmail site (never appearing on mobile). The idea is that customers who are spending time in this tab might be looking for a deal or browsing similar content, increasing the likelihood that a click will be profitable.

All Gmail Sponsored Promotions follow the same format:
<ol>
 	<li>A teaser ad, featuring a headline (25-characters).</li>
 	<li>Body copy (100 characters) that mirrors the format of Gmail’s email preview layout.</li>
 	<li>A clickable image (50 x 50 min or 600 x 1000 max) that opens when the teaser headline is clicked. It can be customized with form fields, video, and other interactive elements.</li>
</ol>
<h2>HOW TO GET IN ON THE ACTION:</h2>
Sounds great, right? We told you so. The ad layouts themselves do a lot of the heavy lifting for you, which means the main key is making sure the right users see the right content. GSP have similar targeting capabilities as Google’s other advertising channels, so you can filter based on all the demographics you’d expect, such as gender, age, geography, and any other public information.

However, GSP also offer some unique, highly attractive targeting capabilities that other ad types don’t have. Think: domain-level targeting, job title, and purchase history (all mined based on pre-existing information in peoples’ inboxes). Just remember, the more specific your search gets, the smaller your audience will be, so balance these needs accordingly or <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency"">partner with a BIGEYE digital specialist</a> to help you find that happy medium.
<h2>SETTING YOURSELF UP TO TRACK SUCCESS:</h2>
GSP is most popular in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce</a> world because it can lead to direct sales, but they can also be used to collect leads and contact information, or raise <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness</a> (especially considering the CPC structure, you have a great opportunity to expose your brand to large audiences even if they aren’t clicking).

In fact, using GSP for some of these secondary use cases is sometimes more successful than trying to drive sales. When you combine ultra creative content with this uniquely primed ad formatting, the potential is great. Without the accompanying price tag.

Why online video advertising is mission critical to your business,"There’s a big reason close to 80% of advertising leaders said they plan to invest more in online video advertising this year than they did last year according to Reuters Institute’s annual digital survey. Actually, there are three big reasons if you ask anyone on our team.
<h2>1. DIGITAL ADS ARE OUT, VIDEO ADS ARE IN:</h2>
Okay, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">digital advertising</a> – like banner ads and pay per click campaigns – isn’t “out,” but it is on the decline. Ad blocking technology is becoming more prevalent and more precise, which means the savviest (and possibly most desirable) customers are opting out of ads. Don’t fear ad blocking: it’s the future. Read our recent blog post about the rise of this technology <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/not-afraid-ad-blocking"">here.</a>

The good news is that over 60% of consumers in a recent Millward Brown study said they would be open to receiving ads if they could control the content or if they were receiving relevant, personal information. That’s why <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">online video advertising</a> is so important. Video advertising helps convey an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">emotional narrative</a> that appeals to the consumer and – when done well – can feel very personal. And thanks to a wide variety of distribution channels and deep targeting capabilities, video can also be highly relevant.
<h2>2. VIDEO GIVES YOU LEVERAGE TO CREATE MEANINGFUL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS:</h2>
Growing brands can often benefit from the “halo effect” of aligning with more established organizations. Local companies can dramatically increase their reach by sharing contacts and social clout with other local companies. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">Video</a> is a gateway to establish these types of partnerships. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">Online video advertising</a> is easy to create, impactful, and primed for partner collaboration. Unlike static ads or print campaigns, video– rather than tells –<em> shows</em> how partnerships work or where two lifestyle brands meet. And, when trying to establish partnerships, collaborating on high-impact creative assets is always better with two budgets, two teams, and two sets of resources. Our <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/agency/team"">team</a> can work with you to identify strong partner opportunities and generate engaging narratives these partners will want to take part in. If NBC Universal can create videos with Vox and BuzzFeed, you can <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">get in on the action</a> too.
<h2>3. MULTI-PLATFORM DISTRIBUTION IS THE WAY OF THE FUTURE:</h2>
Targeted, multi-platform distribution is powerful. We mean really powerful. For example, a television ad that has a complementary YouTube clip drives viewers across platforms and closer to your point of sale. Shareable video content increases your social reach and unlocks new audience potential. ThinkWithGoogle estimates the material impact is a 56% increase in reach just between television and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">online video advertising</a>. When you add on supporting social media campaigns, email, and event marketing that opportunity goes up exponentially.

<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"">Our team specializes</a> in prioritizing cross-platform initiatives to ensure your spend is allocated to create the most impact. Online video advertising allows you to be at the right places at the right times to support your customer journey. They are more engaging than traditional digital ads so they help you reach more people, and build smarter business connections. Most importantly, videos aren’t going anywhere. All you have to do is look at the growing popularity of Facebook’s live stream feature to realize video is all the rage. As technology development continues to shift to a mobile-first mindset, videos will only increase in importance thanks to their ability to quickly and easily convey critical information and establish real emotions between viewers and your brand.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Let’s create some videos together.</a></p>",,11/10/2016 10:10,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Three-Reasons-Why-Online-Video-Advertising-is-Mission-Critical-to-Your-Business-Filtered.jpg,online-video-advertising,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"Voice search is important, even if your customers don't know it","Let’s start by putting a few things in perspective. Although less than 20% of all searches are conducted using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice search</a>, we’ve seen a 3400% increase in voice search since 2008. The dramatic increase in voice search over the last few years can be attributed to the growing capabilities and accuracy of this technology. Most voice search users, especially those searching with a digital assistant such as Siri, indicate they have only started using voice search in the last six months.

Okay, so if the only people using voice search are early adopters and super-nerds, why should your business care? The reason is: voice search is about to hit the mainstream and it is going to change everything you thought you knew about search engine marketing. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">We can help</a>.
<h2>Natural language searches provide engagement cues</h2>
Unlike typical <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">search strategy</a> that focuses on groups of keywords (i.e., “dog stain remover carpet”), voice search hinges entirely on natural language search (i.e.,” what’s the best product to remove dog stains from my antique carpet?”). This growing shift will have SEM impacts that your business can’t afford to ignore.

Primarily, it will change keyword rankings. Because voice is still new, we don’t know exactly how search engines will begin crawling for natural language searches or segmenting voice traffic from browser traffic … but it’s safe to assume it will happen. Because natural language searches often provide more specific insight into what customers are looking for, we predict rich content will play a large role in search ranking.

Natural language searches also reveal customers’ intent and their level of engagement. Continuing with the pet stain example: a voice search for, “What’s the best product to remove dog stains?” reveals a much different intent than either, “Siri, add the best carpet pet stain remover to my shopping list” or “How can I make the best DIY pet stain remover at home?” Having additional context about why a consumer is searching for something or what they are searching for increases the likelihood that when potential customers click your link, they will actually purchase – because you are exactly what the are looking for.
<h2>Local businesses benefit most from voice search</h2>
Knowing exactly what prospects are looking for is especially beneficial to local businesses. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice search</a> combines intent with urgency and serves up solutions that are nearby. Whether you have a brick and mortar store or local e-commerce site, voice search could be serving you up first if your local base is in proximity to relevant search queries. That is why making sure your geo-targeting is on, local business information is up to date, and storefront is searchable is mission critical.

Local businesses also benefit from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice search</a> because one of the most common use cases for voice search occurs while people are driving or actively in the shopping process. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice search</a> allows you to meet your prospective customers’ needs when they need you most by serving local content and map results first.

As the age of the digital personal assistants arrives (hello Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and more), geography and content will become two of the increasingly important drivers that enable them to do their job … which is enabling your customers to find you. Voice search may be a new technology, but once it is perfected, it will make multi-channel distribution and product discovery much more easy and impactful.

Why scalable vector graphics are the new photoshop killer,"Remember the post we shared about why vector graphics are the new JPEG files? If you missed it – don’t worry – you can check out the blog <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/missing-business-without-vector-graphics"">here. </a>We’re going to take that concept one step farther. Introducing: scalable vector graphics (SVG).

Our technical guys tell us that SVG graphics are text files with some serious code magic happening in the background. Our creative guys say they are the gold standard for vector graphics creation. Our business owners say they are so easy to use their interns are creating customer-ready content. … so what are SVG files, really?
<h2>SVG IS SETTING THE NEW STANDARD FOR DIGITAL FILE SHARING AND USE:</h2>
Above and beyond anything else, SVGs are freedom from Photoshop and JPEG files. Not that there is anything wrong with them. Photoshop allows artists and creators to make some incredible artwork. But JPEG and large-scale photo files are difficult to use and implement in the digital world.

They are cumbersome, they take up data storage space, they slow your website and mobile load times, they can be difficult to share and edit on the fly.

SVG files scale, adapt, and load at the same speed your customers can switch between their favorite devices.
<h2>YOUR DEVELOPMENT TEAM WILL THANK YOU, WE PROMISE:</h2>
Your developers will seriously thank you for the switch. SVGs are primed to use with and on other technology. For example, when using a JPEG file, you have to crop and save your images to fit the exact size of each component you want that image to appear in. SVGs adapt on their own, so your developers can plug and play with assets however you or they need them. This saves time, money, editing, and frustration.

SVGs are fully compatible with responsive websites and built with forward-thinking changes to technology in mind that should serve your site for years to come. The internet is always changing, so whenever you can get ahead of the evolutionary curve, it’s good to do so. Save yourself a total overhaul later by integrating SVGs into your creative work now and <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">letting us help.</a>
<h2>ENABLE YOUR TEAM TO BE CREATORS USING SVGs:</h2>
SVG files save you time (and money) in other business areas as well. If you have a small or expanding team, you can use SVG files to train up-and-coming designers (tweaking and editing on SVGs is much easier than you think), or let your more creatively minded marketers try their hand at novice graphics design.

Not everyone is cut out to be a world class designer, but if you invest in a few foundational graphics from an expert designer (not mentioning any names, but our team at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> is pretty awesome), almost anyone can update, use, and repurpose those SVG files. SVGs can be used to make patterns, backgrounds, and print materials in addition to images and icons.

Investing in SVG files lets everyone on your team support the creative process, so your most talented and creative members can focus on generating breakthrough ideas that will break through the clutter.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We aren’t saying you’ll never use Photoshop again, but we do think SVGs can unlock your team’s potential and make life a whole lot easier.<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz""> Let us help you out.</a></p>",,11/14/2016 10:45,1,http://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Why-Scalable-Vector-Graphics-Are-The-New-Photoshop-Killer-Filtered.jpg,scalable-vector-graphics,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Predictive marketing analytics 101: A user’s guide,"You’ve heard us say before that one of the best predictors for future success is past performance. Us marketers are trained to look for past successes and find ways to duplicate the most effective elements of those moments. Now, we can use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">predictive marketing analytics</a> to do this better, faster, and more effectively.

Here is our user’s guide to predictive marketing analytics to help get you started.
<h2>Use case 1: Predictive analytics help model behavior</h2>
Predictive analytics tracks how often certain phrases or behaviors occur before a desired outcome. It then uses that information to gauge the likelihood other prospects will behave the same way. For example, if the majority of people searching online for the terms “puppies for sale” also buy dog food within two months of this search, serving them coupon for dog food during that window might increase their likelihood of choosing your brand. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">Predictive marketing analytics</a> helps identify behaviors that precede sales so you can build a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/"">marketing strategy</a> around them.

Predictive analytics can also help you find “look alike targets."" Look alike targets are people who are interacting with brands closely aligned to yours. Therefore, they may be interested in your products. People who buy dog food might also be interested in dog togs, bedding, or treats. Predictive analytics can help you determine the likelihood these people will buy or what their value may be.
<h2>Use case 2: Use predictive analytics to guide automated marketing</h2>
Automated marketing is an emerging tool that uses data to optimize the exact timing, targeting criteria, spend, and reach of a digital ad before deploying it. The goal is to maximize your return on investment without needing to use a lot of manpower and resources to do the job. Automated marketing can be a great tool to get more bang for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a> buck. Predictive analytics is the foundation of this technology as it helps define the variables used to optimize automated marketing. Our team can help you balance automated marketing against your other channels and strategies effectively and easily. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Click here </a>or give us a call to find out more about how we can help.
<h2>Use case 3: Nurture cross-sell opportunities with predictive analytics</h2>
Using predictive analytics to determine which customers are most likely to need additional products or services your organization offers can help you target those critical few at the right time and increase the likelihood of a new sale. A customer with two or more of your products is then more likely to stay with your company. They'll engage with your brand over their customer lifecycle.
<h2>Use case 4: Predictive analytics is not just for marketing</h2>
This data can also be used to streamline your company’s operations. That means lower costs and more marketing dollars ... right?

Predictive analytics can help you forecast how many sales will occur in a quarter due to seasonality, or the influx of demand that guides your inventory. It can even help determine how much staff or resources you’ll need during peak sales times. This is true in almost every industry from tourism and hospitality, financial services, and retail. Predictive analytics improves makes your business more efficient and your ability to invest in meaningful marketing and support campaigns to take your business to the next level.

You’re losing customers because of your smartphone marketing,"There. We said it. You are losing customers and leaving money on the table because of your smartphone marketing. Over 83% of adults in the United States own a smartphone according to the Pew Internet Project. In other words, that number is too big to ignore.

Smartphones aren’t a trend or a fad anymore. They aren’t simply a tech gadget or symbol of social status. And they aren’t solely for early adopters. They are extensions of how we work, communicate, and complete tasks. All you have to do is look up from the smartphone you’re probably reading this post on and take stock of how many other people around you are looking at their smartphones right now. Exactly.

No movie theater, restaurant, board meeting, or park is safe anymore. We are constantly on our smartphones … and that simple fact has opened up an entirely new way to effectively communicate with and engage customers.
<h2>Mobile intent is solution-driven</h2>
It’s important to understand that people conducting mobile searches, using apps, and interacting with their smartphones are primarily motivated by quick and effective problem solving. Unlike desktop browsing, which is usually associated with deeper research or entertainment, almost all searches on a smartphone are focused on finding a solution to a present situation. This means that your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/""> mobile marketing</a> should not solely aim to educate your customers. It also needs to solve their problems. When building your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">smartphone marketing strategy</a>, start by imagining the scenarios your customers might be in if they are searching for your product on a smartphone and tailor your content around those needs.

Thanks to the emergence of responsive website design, you can adapt your content to reveal itself differently on a desktop and on a smartphone. Save the bells and whistles for your desktop site and lead with your most useful links and information on mobile. In our recent blog post about automated voice search, we talk about the nuances of intent in greater detail. Read that post <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/voice-search"">here.</a>
<h2>CUT THE BULL$@%!</h2>
The important takeaway of realizing your smartphone marketing needs to be solution-oriented is that you don’t have time for fluff. Call it corporate jargon, marketing speak, advertising, or even bull$@%! But when your customers are looking for an answer on the fly, they don’t want to spend time combing through flowery language and vague messaging about your brand. <strong>Get to the point.</strong> Google’s recent research suggests that customers consider an average of 10.4 options and sources before making a purchase. That means your information needs to be relevant, clear, and impactful. If your unique value proposition isn’t clear enough, your customer will simply move on to your competition. Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">smartphone marketing</a> to clearly communicate what makes your brand special and focus on how your brand solves a unique problem for your customers. As they say in business school, “don’t be right – be helpful.”
<h2>Understand mobile's place in the customer lifecycle</h2>
You have to realize that some customers might start their relationship with your brand on a mobile device and finish it on a desktop. This is especially true for B2B products, large-ticket items, and emotional purchases such as vacations. On the flip side, retailers and consumer packaged goods have much less of a hurdle to overcome when getting customers to purchase online (thanks, Amazon). Take time to consider where smartphone marketing makes the most sense in your business’s customer journey. Is it at the top of funnel or bottom of funnel? Is your goal to get people to the point of sale or capture leads? Do you want people to visit your store or purchase online?

These types of questions will help you define your mobile strategy more clearly and tailor your smartphone marketing accordingly. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Our team can help you</a> determine where mobile engagement makes the most sense for your brand and ensure your marketing distribution aligns to your goals.
<h2>No, mobile apps are not the same as mobile presence</h2>
While your smartphone marketing might include <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile app development</a>, don’t assume that your mobile presence is complete simply because your customers can download something on Google Play. People download mobile apps because they already believe a brand can help them accomplish something (think: Instacrat on-demand grocery delivery, Google’s email or maps app, Duolingo’s language lessons, or ClassPass’s workout scheduling assistant). However, those same customers use these brands’ mobile websites to learn about the apps at the very top of the marketing funnel. Oftentimes, your mobile website is your customers’ first experience with your products, so it should be information-focused and concise. Apps, as we mentioned, fall much farther downstream and might ultimately be your point of sale. One is not necessarily more important than the other, and your business may never need an app, so think about where you need to direct your customers most before <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">investing in app development</a>.
<h2>Recognize and use the gateways to mobile</h2>
While you’re getting your smartphone marketing in check, take time to consider where mobile traffic is coming from. Voice assisted searches, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email campaigns</a>, local discovery via maps, television or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video jump campaigns</a>, and even real world cues such as billboards or product placement can all send a customer to their smartphone. Mobile is the landing point for the majority of other marketing campaigns and initiatives so don’t ignore this important channel. As we mentioned, even if your customers don’t complete their purchase on a smartphone, you don’t want to miss an opportunity because they can’t find what they are looking for during their first mobile pass. Think of your smartphone marketing campaigns as a tool or helper rather than an advertising technique and your customers will thank you later. As will your boss.

How to REALLY make actionable data really actionable,"Actionable data is a buzzword that seems to get tossed around casually in job descriptions and team meetings all the time. But what is actionable data? And how do you use it … really? Data points in and of themselves simply point to action, growth, activity, or tasks completed. On their own, they only tell you what is happening. Not why. Actionable data transforms those data points into something you can use to guide <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">your business strategy</a> and make good decisions. Your data should track more than activity. It should reveal the causes, motivations, and psyches that guide behavior so you can adapt your business to meet your customers’ needs. Now, we’re going to tell you how to do that.
<h2>Actionable data hinges on choosing your KPIs wisely</h2>
Before you begin setting up data tracking tools and collecting information, ask yourself what you are tracking and why. Start by reviewing your business goals and choosing KPIs that relate to those metrics. Don’t focus on data that simply shows activity. Instead, focus on data that relates directly back to your goals. If you want to increase sales or customer satisfaction, consider what data might be an indication for sales or engagement success. Once you’ve picked a few metrics, confirm your choice with the following two question test: 1. If this metric were to dramatically increase or decrease, would the business care or feel a sense of urgency about this change? 2. If so, what types of action would you do in response? If you can’t answer those two questions, or the answers suggest the metric you chose is more of an activity tracker than a business indicator, don’t bother charting it. <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">We can help</a> you figure that stuff out.
<h2>Don't confuse correlation with causality</h2>
To act intelligently in response to your findings, you need to be certain that the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">data</a> you’re collecting shows causality – rather than correlation – to a business metric. For example, imagine that an electronics retailer began running two advertising campaigns: one online and one offline. Their goal was to determine whether their customers responded best to online versus offline advertising. Assume they had enough budget to run two ads in major newspapers, so they ran a promotion before Black Friday and around Father’s Day to appeal to holiday shoppers. The return on their investment was fantastic. Online, their budget allowed for digital ads every other week, but not on specific geographic or demographic targeting. The return on that investment was significantly less. The fact that their holiday newspaper ads outperformed their “spray and pray” online banners doesn’t show causality between amazing sales and newspaper advertisements. The cause was seasonality … not advertising channel. If, for example, that same company invested their entire budget in newspaper sales expecting the same return on investment week over week that they enjoyed before Black Friday, they would be sorely disappointed. Avoid this pitfall by doing a gut check on whether your data can point to an actual cause.
<h2>Timing is everything for actionable data</h2>
Good data doesn’t simply reveal what happened to your business. It can also help you predict what might happen in the future. Good forecasting can support your budgeting, planning, cash flow, pricing, promotion, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">resourcing strategy</a>. So yes, basically everything. This is why establishing causality between different variables is so important. Knowing that certain metrics influence other outcomes can help you prepare for likely impacts as variables change or work toward influencing driving behaviors. It is also important to deliver these forecasts with enough time to act or affect change. They say that hindsight is 20/20, but it doesn’t change your bottom line. Sync your forecasting and analysis around your natural business planning and work cycles. Telling your web team that they need to update your landing pages in a week, when you know that they work on monthly planning cycles, does not set yourself up for success.
<h2>Pay attention to the competition</h2>
While you might not have access to your competitors’ revenue and sales information on a granular level, you can easily track their social sentiment, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">media placement</a>, reach, broad web metrics (such as visitor volume), and third party<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/""> content about the brand</a>. Some of these insights may be quantitative in nature, such as trending sentiment or page visits. However, competitors’ qualitative data can be an extremely useful tool as well. This is especially true if you want to increase your share of the market or focus on competitive switching. Qualitative data, in particular, can reveal how your competition’s customer service performs, what products customer want, what features give you an edge, or how you can serve your target audience differently.
<h2>Make your actionable data easy to digest</h2>
Once you’ve uncovered some great insights and establish some ideas about how to impact your business, you need to package your data – aka your proof – in a way that is digestible and contextual. Realize that senior-level audiences may not want to see all the hard work you did to get to your forecast or dig into the nitty gritty details of your data mining. Showing that you did a lot research doesn’t prove that you are right. Showing critical data and putting it in context against your business drivers does. Generally speaking, your decision makers will want to see concise, consolidated readouts that show what’s happening and why it matters. The people who can analyze and use data to its fullest advantage are not always the best people to translate that into “business speak.” Sometimes they are. But if they aren’t, team up with the right individuals to make sure your findings are presented in a context that is easy to understand and that inspires meaningful change. And yes, that means all those amazing Excel charts might not be your smoking gun. There’s a reason that data-driven decisions are so popular: they reduce risk and increase the likelihood of success. Increase your ability to use data by focusing on insights and actions first.

"Instagram stories: how the ""new snapchat"" can help your business","In case you haven't heard, Instagram now offers disappearing messages and photos, as well as expiring video and image stories. If that sounds an awful lot like another <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a> platform you know and love ... you're not wrong. Instagram has been incorporating many of the popular features of Snapchat into their app platform and Instagram stories marketing could do big things for your business, too.<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Tuesday, Instagram took one step closer to the snapchat platform: </strong></h2>
These changes have boosted Instagram's daily use by hundreds of thousands and taps into users' desire to share aspects of their day-to-day lives even if those events aren't ""worthy"" of a permanent spot on their timelines.

Unlike Snapchat, however, Instagram already has a solid business advertising structure and reputation for highly engaged users and shoppers. Well ... Snapchat has somewhat of a reputation too, but their early emphasis on disappearing photos did no favors for business advertising.

Because businesses are already flocking to Instagram (read more about their new, improved business advertising options in our blog post <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/blog/our-thoughts-instagram-video"">here</a>), the next logical question is: how can this help <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">increase marketing and sales</a>?

To answer this question, we're going to tell you a story about a South Florida hair salon called True Hair Miami.
<h2><strong>A story of insta-success: </strong></h2>
Picture yourself in Miami, Florida's hot sun. You're feeling fresh and fabulous after a new haircut, and can't wait to hit the town to debut your new style. As your hair stylist has been working magic on your 'do, she has been taking photos and posting them on the salon's Instagram story. She's also sent you several Snaps - oops, we mean Instagram disappearing photos - to your direct account showing the before and after transformation.

Suddenly, you're Insta-famous. You're on the salon's page for all the world to see, being tagged, and shared, and talked about. The results make customers feel like they are part of the organization and extremely valuable members of the business ecosystem. At the end of the day: everyone just wants to feel special.

Because Instagram has a more business-ready audience, these tags and posts may subconsciously carry more weight than if the same posts had occurred on SnapChat. And because these messages and stories disappear, your business doesn't need to be so judicious about curating content. Everyone can be included.

Instagram Stories marketing builds an emotional connection between the user and the organization through the experience of being tagged or messaged by a business. This can mean a more easy, meaningful rapport, stronger <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">customer service reaction</a>, and willingness to engage with and share that business's other content via<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/""> social media</a>. And let's be honest, shares are the first step to referrals and positive reviews. This emotional connection also boosts customer loyalty and increases the likelihood of repeat sales and services.
<h2><strong>Getting started with Instagram stories marketing:</strong></h2>
Use Instagram's new features to share announcements (think: flash sales and buzz around upcoming events), in-store previews, and service testimonials. The disappearing content's raw and unedited quality rings with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">authenticity and truth</a>, setting it apart from highly edited marketing ads. Instagram's new features give your business one more tool to help you step away from your marketing budget and lean into third-party, user-generated content.

How new metrics work to merge data on & offline marketing data,"<p class=""p1""><i>Tim McCormack, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE’s</a> Digital Marketing Manager, briefly discusses online to offline marketing and how new metrics introduced by Google and Facebook work to merge data on what online ads consumers see and whether consumers who have been exposed to these messages are visiting physical retail stores and restaurants.

<p class=""p1"">What if you could determine that a purchase made at your store was ultimately driven by your latest <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing campaign</a>? This has long been a big blind spot in the world of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">digital analytics</a>. Up until now, we’ve only had power in understanding and knowing how people react to our ads online and the ability to measure and optimize based on their online actions. But what if someone views your display ads and then goes into your store and makes a purchase as opposed to clicking on the display ad and making one of your purchases online? That’s where these new metrics come in.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Both Google and Facebook have come out this year and refined, right in time for the holiday shopping season, these new metrics that they’re calling “store visits”. Store visits utilize cross-device tracking (tracking from both your phone and your computer when you’re logged into Facebook or Google) to identify users who have seen different ads through their ad networks, and then utilizing location services on your mobile devices to determine if you’ve actually gone into the store.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This opens up a whole new world of understanding and attribution for how our online ads are performing.</p>

5 ways a creative agency can bring back your WOW factor in 2017,"<p class=""p1"">2017 is here, and you're probably wondering how you can make this year even better than the last. A new year is a time to energize your marketing goals and blow the competition out of the water. And whether you're hoping to kick off a new look or a new campaign, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">partnering with a creative agency</a> can add a little sparkle to your current plans. We just counted down to the new year, and now we're counting off the top five ways a creative agency can deliver a little ""wow"" to your marketing plans ... so pull those party hats back out and get ready to celebrate what's to come.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>1. FRESH YEAR, FRESH SET OF EYES</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Start the new year by looking back. We know that might sound counter intuitive, but sometimes the best way to break out of a rut or inspire new ideas is to bring in a fresh set of eyes to assess what you've already done. Your creative agency will be able to make recommendations about why certain elements of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">content marketing</a> and advertising strategy worked and where your team could use some support. Let your creative agency bring a fresh, bird’s-eye view to help you spot amazing opportunities that might have gotten overlooked when the team was knee-deep in the day-to-day.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>2. LET YOUR CREATIVE AGENCY TAKE A LOAD OFF</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Why work harder in 2017 when you could work smarter? Since 2016 was such an amazing year, you deserve a little break. Let <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">your creative agency</a> shoulder some of the production and creation so you can focus on big-picture <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">strategy</a> and achieving bigger goals. Delegating creative services to a dedicated, highly skilled agency team can save your in-house employees time, resources, and money wading through tasks just outside their expertise. You'll receive better creative results and enjoy happier, more productive staff. That's what we call a win-win.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>3. 2017 TREND ALERT</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">No one loves chasing a good trend more than creative marketers. If your marketing materials feel a little stale or you've been recycling creative content for the last two years, it's time to get in on 2017's marketing trends before your competition does. A good creative agency will be able to tell you what trends are emerging in your market and how to take advantage of them in a way that will reach your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">target audience</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">cross platforms</a>, and inspire action.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>4. DARE TO BE DIFFERENT</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">This year, your marketing mantra should not be ""if it's not broken, don't fix it."" We know that when something goes well, it's tempting to try to duplicate those circumstances again and again and again. As marketers, it's easy to become risk adverse because there is so much pressure to perform. Let a creative agency help you take calculated risks that will stretch your team's creativity and potential without jeopardizing your business. Because agencies are trained to balance creativity with results, you can rest assured that taking the risk will be worth it.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>5. YOUR CREATIVE AGENCY WILL PUSH YOU FARTHER </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Have you taken a look at what your agency is doing for their other clients lately? Have you read their case studies? Or asked them what they’re passionate about? Go ahead, do a little Facebook stalking and peek into their portfolios. Chances are, you'll be inspired. Creative marketing agencies are becoming more holistic, more creative, and more calculated than ever before.

Should I use a content marketing agency or freelancer?,"<p class=""p1"">To freelance or not to freelance? To hire an agency or go it alone? Those are the questions. Depending on who you speak to, you'll probably bump into a wide variety of (sometimes polarized) opinions about the benefits of each option. The reality is that, whether you choose a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">content marketing agency</a> or hire a freelancer, the ""right"" answer lies within your unique needs. Here are a few pros and cons of each.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Building your content marketing with a freelancer: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">If your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">content marketing strategy</a> is fairly straightforward and your team has the time and expertise to guide your freelancer's work, hiring a writer can be a powerful tool when you need to ramp content up quickly (or down without cutting staff). Hiring a freelancer gives you flexibility, and usually provides a good bang for your buck because you can generate large quantities of high-quality content quickly and affordably.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>PROS: </strong></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1"">Speed to market</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Scalable</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Use for seasonal needs</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">However, freelancers generally require a little extra ""hand holding"" because they may not be engrained in your company culture or have full access to your vision and strategy. Your team will need to field questions about tone, topics, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">keyword strategy</a>, and content roadmap to ensure you get the best results.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Get the most out of your freelancer by treating them like an employee rather than a third party. Don't skimp on sharing creative briefs, ideas, and feedback. If you're worried about privacy or exposing sensitive and strategic information, you can always ask your writer to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Content marketing made easy with an agency: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Agencies really shine if your content marketing plan hasn't been fully fleshed out or you have a smaller staff that may not have time to manage your freelancer's writing process. If you aren't sure what content you need, or how to maximize your reach and impact through content, an agency will provide critical insight to make sure the work you have planned will be beneficial and impactful.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sometimes, agencies offer a la carte services (like freelance writing) so you can enjoy the scalability of a freelancer, with a little extra support from content marketing pros in the background. Talk to your agency about your unique needs to determine how they can best support you and work within your budget.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>PROS: </strong></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">Strategic guidance</a></li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Consistency and quality</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Holistic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">content marketing skills</a></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">You'll get the best results from a content marketing agency if you plan to build a partnership with them. Think of your agency as a secret weapon, a hidden CMO, the wizard behind the curtain. The sky is the limit when you work with a good content marketing agency that understands your short and long-term goals, knows the market, and can make thoughtful recommendations about placement, supplementary advertising material, and unique ways to distribute your content.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With a content marketing agency, you get so much more than ... well ... content. You also get the manpower and expertise to really do something with it. The bottom line? Freelance writing offers a quick, straightforward solution to generate content ... but an agency can start a marketing revolution.</p>
<p class=""p3"">The great news is that you don't need to choose one or the other. Many of our clients start their content marketing with us and use freelance writers to maintain the work we do together when their team is stretched thin or they want to begin a new project and need an extra boost of manpower. Naturally, we are there every step of the way to support so there really is no wrong answer. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Contact us</a> to get started!</p>",,1/12/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Final-Content-Marketing-Picture.jpg,content-marketing-agency-or-freelancer,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
3 Ways copywriting services will increase your marketing potential,"<p class=""p1"">Did you know that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriting services</a> can increase your team's productivity and boost your speed to market? We're always surprised when our clients tell us they never considered hiring copywriting services because they are a fantastic way to maintain and accelerate work with your creative agency partner.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/content-marketing-agency-or-freelancer"">another blog post</a>, we discuss the pros and cons of hiring an agency versus a freelance writer to tackle your content marketing needs. Most people opt to begin their content marketing journey with an agency and then use freelance writing services as a form of content maintenance strategy to keep their work on track.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Whether<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> your creative agency</a> orchestrates your copywriting services, or you hire a freelance writer directly, you'll enjoy these three great benefits of outsourcing your copywriting needs.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>1. STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT NEW PROJECT AND START DOING IT</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We know you're going to leave your 2017 brainstorming sessions with tons of great ideas. And we know that translating those amazing ideas into reality can sometimes take a little extra effort or get lost in the shuffle, especially at the beginning of the year when Q1 goals are full speed ahead. Using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriting services</a> can help get a project into market that might otherwise get stuck in the brainstorming or ""blue sky"" phase. One of the biggest challenges employees face when executing new ideas is simply a lack of time ... and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> - when done right (or we should say write) - can be time consuming. Empower your employees to make their most innovative ideas a reality by partnering with a copywriting services team. This year, your brainstorming sessions can be more than just wishful thinking.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>2. LET YOUR BUDGET BE YOUR GUIDE</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">There are many reasons you might choose to scale back your budget. Some, we know, are more difficult than others. Whether you're simply trying to tighten your margins or you’re downsizing during moments of seasonality, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriting services</a> give you the freedom to scale your staff to your exact needs. You'll never be paying more or less than you need when you use copywriting services because most agencies and freelancers can build a ""pay to play"" model to support your content writing needs. You can expect great, high-quality work without compromising your budget or your staffing and HR plan.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>3. INCREASE QUALITY WITH COPYWRITING SERVICES</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Shh, we won't tell anyone… but we know that sometimes you just need to hire a professional. Your team may shine at many things - but if copywriting isn't one of them, don't sweat it. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">Copywriting services</a> can elevate the quality of your content marketing efforts without a huge increase in budget or manpower. Your staff might even be a little relieved to take those duties off their plates.</p>
<p class=""p3"">All write, that's what we're talking about! Those are some pretty amazing reasons to take the plunge and try copywriting services.

Targeting multi-family property residents with SEO services,"<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s2"">The top 4 reasons you need SEO services to unlock multi-family property marketing</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">When people search for multi-family property residences and real estate listings, first consideration often goes to ... well... the first listings they find. This is especially true in regions where there is plenty of supply, or where first time lessees are entering the market. Having a dedicated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO company</a> can reduce your marketing cost by targeting the residents most likely to fit your property so you can get more with less. Here are the top four ways an SEO agency can help:</p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>1. Let your SEO consultant be your guide:</strong> Instead of wondering which keywords to target, or what multi-family property residents are searching for, your SEO agency can do the heavy lifting. They use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a>, digital targeting, and data to find the exact keywords residents in your area are using and then help you outrank your local competition based on those terms. They take the guesswork out of your search efforts and increase speed to market. In other words, they perfect that whole timing piece.</p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>2. Your SEO agency knows how to repurpose content:</strong> Reduce, reuse, and recycle just got a new lease on life: your SEO agency can reduce staff, reuse content, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">recycle marketing materia</a>l that works. Many big real estate companies are churning out content at the speed of light. They are writing with Bing, and Google, and Yahoo search in mind. This puts small and medium sized businesses at a disadvantage when trying to market to multi-family property residents. SEO services agencies know how to adapt, repurpose, and augment your existing content and digital assets to get the most out of them and compete with the big guys. Whether transforming print materials and brochures into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">web-ready content</a>, or creating turnkey templates that will engage your audience while quickly sharing critical property information, your SEO company can get the job done quickly and easily.</p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>3. YES, images are great for SEO too:</strong> Many of our real estate clients know the value of a great picture (or ten). They are SnapChatting previews of new properties, creating social links for residents in multi-family properties, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">showing rather than telling</a>. The amazing thing is that all of these images can have a dramatic and positive impact on your search rankings. Many search engines weight images higher than text content, so having the right SEO services and tagging in place can make or break how your rankings show up. Let a SEO company demystify the process and set your website and social channels up correctly so that you can enjoy the benefits of the great work you're already doing.</p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>4. Your most shareable content can be your biggest asset:</strong> Your SEO consultant will also let you in on one of the best kept digital marketing secrets. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">Social media</a> is good for SEO. Every time someone shares content from your site, links to your website on their blog, tweets your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">homepage</a>, or shares your posts, you reap the benefits because search engines catalogue your content as highly relevant. Social media isn't just fluff, it's customer marketing. The important thing is making sure the <i>right</i> content is being shared, tagged, and back-linking with the right people and pages. An SEO agency can make sure this happens without relying solely on CPC campaigns and ads.</p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s1"">SEO services may not be as glitzy as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">videos</a>, interactive pages, and 360 property tours, but they are powerful. Take the first step in making 2017 your best year yet by looking at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/work"">some examples of our work</a> and getting ahead of the competition. Those guys are so 2016. </span></p>

10 tips for theme park advertising from a video production company,"<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">We may think SEO, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeting</a>, and CRM programs are a day in the park (pun intended), there is one tool that rules them all in the realm of fun: <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production services</a>. Because you're selling an emotional experience, few tools can capture the unique customer experience of your product like a video production company. Our experts reveal their favorite way to bring theme park advertising to life through video. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>1. A video production company will nail experiential marketing:</strong> It's hard to describe the feeling of g-force making your eyes water as you fly down the first drop of a new rollercoaster. And it's hard to describe that signature shade of cotton-candy pink that lets you know you've found your favorite concession stand. And it's hard to describe the anticipation associated with the sound of pressurized hydraulic mist before lazy river riders get drenched. Web video production can. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">Video production</a> is the heart and soul of experiential marketing in the digital age. Enough said.  </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>2. Transform user generated content into marketing collateral:</strong> No one can capture the amazing memories of a day at a theme park quite like your visitors. Using a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production company</a> to polish and repurpose user generated content or to capture its essence and transform it into marketing content is the best way to let potential visitors in on all the inside jokes, sweet treats, thrills and spills waiting for them just inside your gate. Video contests, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media campaigns</a>, and YouTube are only the beginning of the video production services you can use to showcase your best visitors and THEIR best moments. We love it when our customers do our work for us and you should too. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>3. Unleash your newest rides:</strong> One of the things that keeps people coming back to theme parks again and again is new attractions. A good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">film production company</a> can build anticipation, generate buzz, and cultivate an air of excitement around new features and rides. A video production company makes it easy to show off elements of a new feature without giving the entire experience away, building just the right amount of desire. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>4. Tell your story:</strong> Web video production is one of the best, quickest, and most effective ways to tell your brand story. When people think of the Disney brand, their parks - and the vision of families interacting on site - are some of the most iconic images in the industry. When you use video to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">tell a brand story</a> the way Disney does, your customers' experiences aren't just about a day in a theme park, they are about an entire narrative or lifestyle that will keep them coming back or sharing their experiences with others. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>5. Good video is a four-year investment:</strong> One of the most common things our clients tell us is that they are worried about hiring a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">video production company</a> because it will be too expensive and their assets will need refreshed too often. We are here to debunk that myth. Good b-roll footage of your park, brand assets, and story narrative can last anywhere between three and four years. It's important to set expectations with your videography company upfront, so they can work both within your budget and time horizon to create the content you need. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>6. Shh ... it's okay to use stock footage:</strong> A good film production company will help you understand where you can use stock footage and where it's important to have <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">brand-specific video clips</a>. Blending both can help augment your existing photo and text base, and compliment your campaigns. Don't worry, it isn't cheating and almost everyone does it. The trick is doing it the right way. Your agency will help you blend stock and original footage so your results are always original, tasteful, and on message. And most importantly, within copyright guidelines. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>7. Video is an SEO goldmine:</strong> Like images, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-post-production-services/"">video</a> can play a huge role is boosting your SEO ranking. Work with your web video production company to properly tag, target, and post videos to maximize both exposure and SEO. Good video is not only shareable, but highly indexed by search engines. Because video also happens to be some of the most engaging content available, you win in more ways than one. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>8. You can't win in multi-channel marketing without video:</strong> Customers are learning about your brand on multiple devices, at multiple times, and sharing their attention with multiple assets. Video is a miraculous medium that can cross these channels and devices seamlessly and encourage prospective visitors to head closer to your point of sale. Work with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production company</a> to determine how video can drive sales and encourage guests to reach your website through a specific call to action or jump trigger.  </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>9. Side-by-side comparisons:</strong> One of the most fun ways to use video to promote your theme park is through side-by-side comparisons. Whether you want to show off your fun factor, appeal to adrenaline junkies, or bring families together, a dramatized comparison of your park to a regular day, or a head-to-head view of your competition should easily do the trick. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>10. It's a lot easier than you think:</strong> Last, but not least, using web production services is a lot easier than you think. No matter how new you are to the medium or what your budget is, your agency can work with you to tailor video assets to your exact needs. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/work"">Click here</a> to explore some of the videos we've work on for our clients. We recommend new video users try a hybrid of agency crafted material and hand-held DIY content to get started and grow together. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Video is fun and effective. It's highly engaging. And one of the most consistently growing digital trends of 2017. The best part is that your customers are already digesting videos regularly, so you can easily capture their attention without working too hard. And if there's one thing we wish for 2017 -- it's that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">we can help you</a> work smarter, rather than harder. </span></p>",,1/20/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Enlight1-3.jpg,theme-park-advertising-video-production-company,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
What do you do when your audience ISN'T millennial?,"We all know that staying competitive in the digital world means staying on top of new marketing trends, knowing when the latest <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> changes are taking place, and trail blazing new opportunities. But, if you are trying to focus on a more elderly market or targeting senior marketing initiatives, it's important that you use market research to understand where your audience is spending their time online, how they are consuming digital content, and what types of senior marketing ads are relevant to their lives.
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This year (or at least part of the year), forget about the millennials. We know, we know. We can hear your collective gasp from here. We are exaggerating a little bit. We only give this advice to organizations and brands that are targeting baby boomers, senior marketing, or non-technical natives. If that's you: read on. </span></p>
<strong><span class=""s1"">1. Use market research to target your senior marketing group</span></strong>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">First and foremost: big data is your friend. We have never been able to glean a more precise understanding of what people are doing and where they are spending their time online than right now. This is important when you are targeting a group that may not consume digital content the way you intended them to. Older demographics may favor certain channels over others, adopt trends slower than digital natives, and more consistently start and complete their online journey on fewer devices. While this certainly isn't always the case, it is a good foundation to begin building and testing into hypothesis to drive your digital sales motions. Use a little <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a> to guide where you believe people are entering your site, how best to target them, and why they may be having trouble completing sales farther down the funnel. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">2. Start 2017 with ""winback"" senior ads</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another great use for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">market research</a> within the senior subset is for winbacks. In short: do your homework. Cross reference information about your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">target audience</a> with your competitive set to understand why you may have lost some customers over the past year, then target and differentiate yourself to win them back. Market research is especially helpful when you are trying to avoid a downstream price war or want to avoid competing on price alone. Remember, when you're targeting Baby Boomers, you have the luxury to focus on value rather than price because they still hold the top spot as the demographic with the most disposable income in the market. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">3. Market research unlocks product innovation within the senior marketing group</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the same way that market research can help you determine which customers are most likely to come back to your brand, it can also help you understand if (and where) you fall short against your competition. Use market research to understand how important certain features or services are, how valuable your product and others like it are perceived to be, and what secondary targets might be interested in your brand. This information can help you expand your market share by depending loyalty within your older segment and preparing for the next generation of customers. </span></p>

Read why your apartment complex needs direct mail services,"<p class=""p1"">In a world that's always on, people are starting to feel nostalgic for the good ol' days. Just look at the fashion retail industry for evidence. When the ability to buy and sell clothes online exploded into the market, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce</a> drove more than one brick and mortar retailer out of business. Today, many e-commerce sites are expanding into the ""real world"" and increasing their physical footprint. Why? Because the average consumer wants a balance. And this is especially true in the real estate business. That's where direct mail services come in.</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s2"">Your apartment complex needs direct mail services because leases are signed and deeds are written once all practical needs are met and emotion takes over. Direct mail can quickly break through the clutter of the many other qualified complexes, properties, and buildings you are competing against to convey the emotional elements behind your brand. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s2"">If you're a luxury high rise, you might invest in some matte black, heavily weighted invitations to visit your sales center. If you're focused on filling your urban-industrial lofts with millennials and hipsters, maybe something a little more rustic or bespoke will do the trick. Either way, you just captured your future residents' attention. </span>From there, you can send them across marketing platforms to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media accounts</a>, or directly to your property.</p>
<p class=""p3""><b>Direct mail marketing feels personal.</b></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s2"">We aren't talking about the old spray and pray method. We're talking about direct mail that targets potential residents based on zip code and lifestyle indicators. When your brand combines the power of big data with direct mail advertising, the results can make your customers feel like you are inviting them home ... to their home. Extend the same methods we've shared about targeting online into the physical world to surprise and delight your audience into taking action.

<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s2"">Direct mail services help engage residents before they start looking.</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s2"">One of the biggest benefits of a bulk mailing service is that you can capture future residents' attention before they even start looking. Creative, personalized material can plant a positive seed about your brand before your would-be residents begin comparing your offerings against others. This helps differentiate your brand or give you advanced consideration over your competition when it's time for the resident to begin honing in on the types of amenities and locations they need. This is especially important for emerging or repositioning units or in highly saturated markets. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s2"">Direct mail might feel a little old school, but it can be a digital marketer's best friend in the real estate industry.

Real estate profs: Our PPC advertising can decrease your CPC,"<p class=""p1"">We already told you that search optimization is a critical success factor for real estate marketing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/targeting-multi-…ith-seo-services"">(click here to view that blog post)</a>. What we didn't tell you was that our PPC advertising agency can actually lower the cost of your CPC campaigns. It's vital to utilize natural as well as paid channels to reach people who are researching housing options. The trick is to optimize your ad spend so that you can invest as little as possible in paid search marketing and leverage your natural content and digital assets to your advantage.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">To do this, you need to find and partner with a PPC advertising agency who can serve as a trusted search advocate. Here are three pro tips we help all of our clients accomplish when they work with us on their search needs, to get you started.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>1. Invest local, optimize global:</strong> One of the best strategies a PPC advertising agency can support is investing in local ad spend. Unless you have a massive budget, you may find it difficult to compete on the national (or international) level, so use your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing agency</a> to determine who your regional competition is and let the games begin. By focusing narrowly on key, local terms, you can reduce your CPC because there are fewer people bidding on those words; however, when <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">targeted correctly</a>, you can maximize exposure in your own back yard. And in the real estate market, it's your own back yard that matters most. On the flip side, your agency should also be able to help you optimize your content and website for organic search so that you still have that national and global presence you crave.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>2. Test everything:</strong> All<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/""> pay per click</a> management companies have the ability to test how your PPC spend is performing in the market. Ask them to test multiple ad bid and spend combinations to find the sweet spot where you're getting results without increasing your CPC. Additionally, when you choose a PPC advertising agency that is creatively driven, they can help link your ads to your holistic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy</a> to your cross-channel goals. As customers increasingly switch between devices, it's important that every channel - whether it's paid or not - works together seamlessly.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>3. Don't forget about social:</strong> Because word of mouth is such a powerful referral source within the real estate market, using PPC ads on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> can support your desire to appear authentic, local, and more natural. Paid social media ads (more so than search ads) are designed to look and feel like shareable, organic content. By doing so, you get two opportunities to reach future residents: first, through the ad itself; and second, when those people share your content.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Balancing CPC campaigns against your other advertising efforts and natural search optimization is one part art and one part science. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/work"">Let our team show you</a> how they've struck the perfect balance for clients just like you.</span></p>",,1/21/2017 14:21,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Enlight1-2-1.jpg,real-estate-ppc-advertising-agency-can-decrease-cpc,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How tracking pixel services can boost your company's marketing,"<strong>What are tracking pixel services?</strong>

Chances are if you’re reading this you are between the ages of 18 and 44, live in Orlando, have earned a college degree and work in business leadership or marketing, are a frequent traveler despite a household income lower than $100K per year (maybe because you likely don’t have children), and watch 60 Minutes, NFL football, and Nashville. You might not realize it yet but you’re also 13 times more likely than the national average to own a car bought in 2014, 6 times as likely to have moved recently, 5 times as likely to use Yelp, 4 times as likely to own Vans and watch Bob’s Burgers, 3 times as likely to be vegetarian, and 2 times as likely to be an NHL hockey fan.

If any of these apply to you, you may be wondering how it’s possible that we know this. Some may seem obvious – it certainly makes sense to guess that the majority of people reading a blog article from an Orlando advertising agency would be college grads living in Orlando and working in business and marketing – but clearly we have more data on you than just what educated guesses are likely to provide. After all, although we would love to hear your recommendations in the comments, we haven’t asked you to give us any information about your favorite TV shows or sports, what clothing brands you wear, when you bought your car, or whether you like Yelp. So how did we know?

We know, because at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">BIGEYE</a> we utilize tracking pixel services both for ourselves and for our clients to get better understanding of our audience. Tracking pixel services utilize a small, transparent 1 x 1 transparent pixel image or GIF that is downloaded by each unique IP address that views a piece of online content that is affixed with the tracking pixel code. In order to load the content, a user’s browser has to reach out to an advertiser’s server with a unique request including the IP address. This offers advertisers the ability to track the number of pixels that have been shown in the server logs.

<strong>How do tracking pixel services work?</strong>

While tracking pixels have been utilized for counting impressions and pageviews for over a decade, it’s only in the last year that pixel tracking services have transformed into an integral part of persona marketing and understanding your audience. By utilizing IP addresses as unique identifiers, advertising networks have been able to create an audience grid identifying what consumers are viewing what content online by analyzing the unique tracking pixels that they are carrying. Furthermore by entering into agreements with credit companies like Experian, TV providers such as TiVo, and research companies such as DLX advertisers are able to integrate offline and demographic information through IP matching.

However, once the data has been run through an audience grid, the IP addresses are scrubbed from the data and it is fully anonymized with no personal identification information (PII) provided to the advertisers who are utilizing pixel tracking services. So while we are able to identify what segments of our audience are interested in, we are able to identify what any characteristics of any unique users to our site. So yes, Carl, you’re in luck – we can’t tell your boss that you’ve spent the past three hours on Facebook or about your abiding love for telenovas.

<strong>What are the benefits of tracking pixel services?</strong>

While it’s certainly interesting just to take a look and see what your website visitors are interested in when they’re perusing your blog, tracking pixel services are also an extremely powerful tool for media planning and persona marketing.

If you are currently running broadcast or cable television buys, how certain are you that the programs your ads are appearing in are the programs that your audience is watching? With tracking pixel services you can be guaranteed to purchase only televisions shows that a majority or a plurality of our audience watches. Or if you’re looking for a way to reach your audience at a lower cost utilize the affinity information to identify what lower-cost and GRP programs your audience is significantly more likely than the average to view.

And the benefits to persona marketing are clear. Having a greater understanding of different segments of your target audience and what their demographic and affinity interests are gives you a more built-out and developed persona.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Let us know</a> how we can help you utilize tracking pixel services to your company's advantage.",,1/18/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pixel_blog_hero.jpg,tracking-pixel-services-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why you need influencer marketing to launch your new product,"More than 40% of consumers base purchase decisions on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">influencer marketing</a>, such as seeing someone use a product on YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram, according to Twitter <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">analytics</a>. That’s a fancy way of saying: seeing is believing.

Whether it’s a yelp review, a blog post, a YouTube “unboxing” video, or Vine tutorial – you’ve probably consumed your fair share of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">social influencer marketing content</a>. As a marketer, it’s hard to control the messaging your customers release into the wild, and even harder to generate enough organic buzz for anyone to take notice. That’s why working with an influencer marketing agency or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">social media influence team</a> is so helpful when launching a new product.

<strong>Okay, so how do you find social influencer marketing champions?</strong>

Think of your influencer marketers as your brand champions, enthusiasts, and experts. If you sell beauty products, they should be the first people to grab your products from the shelves and the first to post a makeup tutorial on YouTube. If you’re a restaurant owner, they should be the first to review new menu items and enthusiastic evangelists within the local community. You get the idea. But how do you find them?

An<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/""> influencer marketing agency</a> can help you determine which platforms are best for your product because you won’t be able to have a strong presence everywhere. Certain platforms are more naturally aligned to different industries or product types. For example, Twitter is very popular within the technology sector, but far less popular in the hospitality market. Your agency partner will guide where you invest your time and resources to ensure the right people are seeing your efforts.

They can also help you identify people who are already using your brand and understand what motivates them to write blog posts and share your content (hello, product samples and gift certificates). <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Influencer marketing agencies</a> are familiar with the wide array of tools that support customer relationships and loyalty so they will have a few tricks up their sleeves to jumpstart your program with your budget and needs in mind.

<strong>We have a social following...now what?</strong>

Once you build a place where social influencers can congregate and share ideas, it’s time to test the waters with a product launch. Make sure you already have a foundation of followers before using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">influence marketing</a> to unveil a new product so you can measure the impact of your efforts. Remember, if a tree falls in the forest and no one posts it on Instagram, it never happened.

Your agency will take care of three critical elements of your product launch:

<strong>      1. Defining your audience: </strong>They will meticulously target the types of social influencers who will be most beneficial to your launch and use market research to contact them or engage them with your brand.

<strong>      2. Determining launch placement:</strong> This may include sending product samples, hosting a “soft launch” for key influencers, organizing a Q&amp;A panel, and much more. Although you may want your influencers to post online, chances are, you’ll need to do something to get their attention first.

<strong>      3. Tracking results</strong>: Building a community or curating social media can require a surprising amount of manpower and resources, which is why tracking your ROI is so important. Your agency can determine the value of your effort through metrics such as ad equivalency value (AEV), social reach, and engagement.

But the most important thing to remember is that influencer marketing takes time.

3 tips to improve your nursing home content marketing,"It's easier than ever before to find reviews, read about patient experiences, and shop for nursing homes. The market is changing, so your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> should also. Digital natives are accustomed to having information at their fingertips and immersing themselves with a brand in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital environment</a> before making a choice. Because choosing a nursing home hinges on both practical and emotional variables, content is an important part of this information loop to educate potential customers about your facilities and build an emotional connection to your site. Accurate, engaging, and up-to-date content can make or break your ability to relate with today’s decision makers.

Consumers often cite “convenience” and “trust” as primary considerations when choosing health care (alongside cost, of course). As a marketer, you may not have control over your facilities’ prices, but you can make it easier for prospective clients to find information, reach out for assistance, and begin building an open, earnest relationship.

The heart of this data suggests customers are looking for two things: ease and reassurance. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">Content marketing</a> can give them both.<strong> </strong>

<strong>     1. Don’t be afraid to ask</strong>

Improve your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> by asking customers what information they need and how easy it is for them to find what they are looking for on your site. Simple web survey tools such as Qualaroo can help you do this on your own, or work with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing agency</a> to complete a full audit. These results will inform what content is missing (or whether the content you do have is lost or misplaced). Before you start focusing on the bells and whistles such as testimonials or social media, nail the basics.

<strong>      2. Empower your customers</strong>

Many nursing homes try to increase engagement with their prospective clients by limiting information such as pricing, insurance information, or onboarding processes on their websites. This forces prospective customers to call and engage in a person-to-person information (read: sales) call. Younger generations simply don’t participate in the consumer journey the same way their predecessors did and this can be a huge barrier when they are researching healthcare providers. Whether it’s in the form of periodic informational <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">webinars</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">newsletters</a>, or transparent online, it’s important to empower your customers to find the information they need up front. All content should be built with the express goal of helping your customers accomplish something on their own, not to drive them into the administrative office. This improves trust, strengthens your relationship with your clients, and helps them feel confident in your nursing home.

<strong>      3. Encourage customers to be cheerleaders</strong>

Sharing your story with a nursing home can be a very emotional experience. But no content is more engaging and more authentic than real testimonials. Use customer-generated content as the most valuable asset on your site, across your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social platforms</a>, and during the customer lifecycle. This content is more than three times likely to generate engagement and shares than anything your marketing department might create, so start identifying your best customers today and encourage them to share their stories.

Read why home health marketing needs social media,"When establishing a positive reputation in the highly regulated, highly saturated healthcare market, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media agency</a> can transform your brand into a go-to source for information and wellness. Beyond traditional social media management, your agency can tap into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital education techniques</a> -- such as webinars and groundbreaking thought leadership through blogs and digital posts – that will break through the clutter in your market. Here are our top six favorite ways you can get started with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/multicultural-marketing-agency/"">social media agency</a> today.

<strong>1. Use market research and big data to understand your audience</strong>

Because your patients may not be the same people who are choosing your home health services, it’s important to understand how your audience is finding information about your services and what criteria they are using to make decisions. A good social media agency can offer a unique look into where people start their journey (perhaps via a magazine ad or radio campaign), and how they migrate across platforms from their mobile devices, map and GPS apps, and onto their desktops. By using proprietary data and mapping that against third-party information, these agencies can paint a clear picture of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">who your audience</a> is, and what is most important to those individuals.

<strong>2. Give customers something they can’t find anywhere else</strong>

Online learning opportunities, guest speakers, and panel discussion can transform the home health education and shopping experience through highly shareable, personalized content. Host a webinar with the founder of your organization, a leading specialist in your health field, or customers willing to share their testimonials. In addition to the potential customers you touch during that event, online events generate a substantial amount of buzz with very little effort. The best part is that these events also serve as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">mini focus groups</a> where you can learn about the issues your customers care about most, what information they aren’t getting in the broader marketplace, and reveal key areas where you can differentiate yourself as a provider. By listening to your attendees’ questions, evaluating the type of people who sign up, and following up with a post-session survey, you can take your market research to the next level.

<strong>3. Practice makes perfect</strong>

Once you think you’ve found a niche, begin <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">testing content</a> that appeals to your audience. You might not nail your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a>, content, or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">marketing strategy</a> the first time so we recommend testing everything. Use your social media agency to prioritize the big swings against small improvements to balance revolutionary ideas against critical, business updates. If you don’t get something right the first time, try it again. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">Web tests</a> allow you to expose only a small part of your digital audience to certain content or ideas, giving you freedom to break outside the traditional healthcare box.

<strong>4. Grab their attention</strong>

The healthcare industry is not always known for its cutting edge social presence and interactivity. By keeping your content fresh and on the cutting edge, you can unlock new client potential. A good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media agency</a> knows what trends are emerging and how to use them effectively, so you can find the right balance between staying ahead of the curve and veering too far away from your target audience. Your social media agency can look at where your customers are spending their time online, understand the devices they are using, and build custom-made marketing campaigns around these individualized behaviors.

<strong>5. Embrace the second screen</strong>

Understanding that most customers are searching for information across multiple devices at the same time can be a huge benefit to home health marketing professionals. Geo-based, local apps complement broader SEO initiatives, and mobile app development that create a seamless customer and prospect experience. The better your agency understands the organic migration across platform, the more easily you can be at the right place at the right time for your customers.

<strong>6. Use a social media agency to solicit feedback</strong>

Some customers may be reticent to provide feedback to their home health provider in fear that their service may falter or that they don’t have other options. If your organization is truly dedicated to improving, you can use your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media agency</a> to solicit open, honest (or even anonymous) feedback about your marketing outreach, and service experiences. Social listening and customer management are critical mechanisms your agency can support to compile this feedback and turn it into actionable items.

Your social media agency can serve as an extra set of eyes and ears to get to know your clients better. Sure, they can support your Facebook and Twitter pages, but there is a lot more to social media management than meets the eye. Check out <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/work"">some of our work</a> and see how <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">we can help</a>.",,1/30/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Enlight1-4-1.jpg,why-home-health-marketing-needs-social-media-agency,publish,,Top,0,open,0
4 ways influencer marketing can get travel brands on the map,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">Influencer marketing</a> is more impactful for travel and hospitality brands than almost any other industry because these emotional purchases can be tarnished by misleading photos (we love a good wide angle lens as much as the next guy, but come on people), hidden fees, and outdated information. 68% of consumers rely on review sites to help form their opinion on hotel purchases, so if your travel brand isn’t taking advantage of this incredible marketing tool – you’re missing out. Here are four ways an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer marketing agency</a> can get your brand in front of your customers and on the map today.

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reviews, reviews, reviews: </strong>One of the most obvious (but important) ways an influencer marketing agency can support your brand is through <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social review</a> sites. Whether you need help registering your travel brand, claiming your physical space in the digital world, or encouraging past customers to write, an agency can support you. Following up with customers and soliciting reviews is a great way to find out what you’re doing well and where you can improve. In the service-based world of hospitality, there is no more valuable information than this feedback. Hopefully, you can showcase what’s going well and encourage other people to visit. If things aren’t going well, studies show that brands that listen and correct the situation openly are considered just as trustworthy as brands that didn’t have problems in the first place, so don’t despair. As an added bonus, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer marketing agencies</a> can stay on top of new comments as they come in so customers feel you value their feedback.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Claim your local listing: </strong>Claiming your local listing, optimizing it for local search results, and keeping this information relevant is the first step in search engine optimization. Without this, your business can’t compete. This is especially true in destinations where you are competing with a variety of other travel and tourism brands. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">Influencer marketing agencies</a> can link your Google+ reviews, customer ratings, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> to your local listing so your brand is easier to find and engage with. Letting an influencer marketing agency take care of this for you ensures that all of the tagging and targeting complements your other paid and natural search efforts. These three pieces need to be working in perfect harmony for the best results.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Don’t forget about the bloggers: </strong>While sending bloggers on a free trip to your resort or providing them with a free feast in exchange for an honest review may seem like a huge expenditure for your brand, it can have a tremendous impact. Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">influencer marketing agency</a> can help you identify bloggers with the most clout and largest following of potential customers who are likely to take action. By strategically targeting the right social influencers, you can gain the attention of their followers who will want to share in the same experiences their favorite blogger is raving about. In other words, you’re getting word-of-mouth referrals on steroids. Top bloggers have hundreds of thousands of followers and tremendous sway within the market. The trick is simply finding the right ones. In addition to helping you identify the right bloggers, your agency may have trusted relationships with certain social influencers to ensure their content honestly frames your brand in the best light.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Connect your influencers with an app: </strong>If there’s one thing social influencers love, it’s connecting with other social influencers. Let your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">agency create an app</a> that informs customers about events, special promotions, and unique opportunities for your most valued customers. This type of loyalty program can become a unique form of networking when it also links users together to mix and mingle during these events or share in these opportunities. The SoHo Beach House is famous for this type of social promotion thanks to their on-site app, extensive list of events, and exclusive directory. Everyone wants to belong to something exclusive and your influencer marketing agency can make that happen at the touch of a button.</li>

In our last post about this topic, we explained that video ads and content are beginning to replace – or at least supplement – traditional digital advertising techniques such as banner ads and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">pay per click campaigns</a>. Last year, more companies than ever invested in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production</a> because they realized that video increases engagement. We hope last year’s 2016 resolution was taking tons of Vine videos, starting a YouTube channel, and testing the waters. Because the new year is here and it’s time to get serious. When you partner with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">video editing company</a>, they can help you reuse good, pre-existing footage, identify areas of opportunity, and amp up your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/""> story telling capabilities</a> by stitching together key messaging and shots. More than 82% of companies that increased their video spend last year said it had a positive impact on their business, according to Single Grain. Engaging videos, however, hinge on having good, authentic content that is polished and professional. We know your Instagram story skills are good – but this year, it’s time to aim for great.

<strong>       2. Use a video editor to tell your brand story:</strong>

To make your videos great, it’s important to tell a story. Most people do this intuitively on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a> when they create clip reels and short video stories of their life experiences. As consumers, we naturally gravitate toward videos that speak to us on that social, community-minded level. The value of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">good video editing services</a> lies in their ability to tell a story and create a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">genuine narrative</a> while inspiring action (not just engagement and consumption). Whether your video is three seconds long or three minutes long, you need to capture your audience’s attention, communicate something important, and end with a call to action … without losing the storyline. This careful balance is one-part science and one-part art. Video producers also have an eye on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/drone-video-services/"">emerging video trends</a> in terms of tone and treatment so that the videos you share are creatively relevant and meet consumers’ subconscious expectations about what a video should look and feel like. You don’t want to accidentally craft an entire marketing campaign around that outdated, so-2016  filter, do you?

<strong>       3. Your video editing company will get you on the platforms you need:</strong>

For video to be effective, it needs to be in front of the right people at the right times. Ideally, your video would also <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">link to your email campaigns</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional marketing</a> efforts, and other outlets. Using a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">video editing company</a> can help you determine where this makes sense, where it doesn’t, and how to effectively use video to cross platforms, devices, and marketing mediums. Making these links yourself can be very time consuming and even impossible unless you have professional-grade video editing and posting software. While there are a lot of great free tools in the market, they aren’t created with marketers in mind. With an agency, you get two birds with one stone: video strategy and an amazing finished product.

Industry face-off: Interactive email marketing and why it works,"As digital marketers, we are obsessed with reading industry blogs, looking for new trends, and hearing what our fellow nerds and tech enthusiasts have to say. We recently saw a great post from David Bailey – who, for the record, we love. In his post, which you can <a href=""https://medium.dave-bailey.com/2017-is-the-year-of-interactive-email-b6c1c4960c72#.scesy8wz1"">read here</a>, he crowns 2017 the year of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">interactive email marketing</a>. And we agree! … but we don’t agree with why he thinks so. Or at least, we believe there might be some deeper, underlying reasons why his central thesis is true. We encourage you to read Dave’s post, but have to politely go head-to-head in an industry face off about the “why.”

<strong>Seriously, email marketing works!</strong>

At the most basic level, we agree with Dave on why <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">interactive email marketing</a> works. According to Constant Contact, more than 80% of smartphone users check their email in the morning … before brushing their teeth. You read that right. The vast majority of people think checking their email is more important than tackling their morning breath. As Dave points out, email has high engagement rates, and you own every single email on your distribution list so there’s no need to pay for play. We have also found that email is one of the most effective ways to increase loyalty, inspire product use, and keep customers coming back again and again (or referring their friends). And we all know, keeping a customer, or convincing them to become a repeat purchaser, is a lot easier than soliciting a new client.

<strong>Okay...but why?</strong>

With so many emerging <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital communication tools</a> – from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social platforms</a> like Snapchat to non-traditional messaging tools like Slack – you might expect to see a decline in the importance of emails. Email fatigue is real, and we’re betting you’ve experienced it in your own office or inbox. As the number of ways we can connect online increases, people are craving more and more human interaction. That being said, email is still highly effective and has successfully evolved and adapted to consumers’ expectations about consumption. Email is more mobile friendly than ever, thoughtful tagging tools and apps let you filter what messages you see and when, and integrations help you personalize the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email experience</a> across platforms.

Dave suggests that email works because no other platform has beat it out yet. He specifically suggests that the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile app market</a> is too saturated to be successful now that the novelty has worn off (you know, just because there’s an app for that, doesn’t mean consumers want it); and that messaging tools are headed in the same direction. We disagree. Messaging tools are stickier than ever and boast some of the highest repeat user rates across the digital landscape. We don’t believe email works because there aren’t equally popular platforms out there. We believe email works because it’s the only one that can adapt to devices and platforms seamlessly. In other words, email really nails that seamless multi-platform experience we keep telling you about.

<strong>It's all about the power of multi-platform connection and email marketing.</strong>

New scripts and email codes are making this experience even better by making it possible to add buttons, animations, and interactive elements to emails. This removes a click barrier between the inbox and a shopping cart, an<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/""> e-commerce point of sale</a>, or call to action. Interactive elements link one of the most engaging marketing channels closer to our day-to-day lives and needs by reducing the need to migrate to and load a website, re-enter information, or get too far away from whatever other tasks you may be completing in your inbox.  This is especially powerful for consumer products and transactional purchases that rely on a smooth sales cycle and purchase experience.

4 signs your bank (really) needs a new print production agency,"In a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/dont-get-left-cold-apartment-complex-needs-direct-mail-services"">recent post</a>, we shared why <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">direct mail</a> can be such a powerful marketing tool within the financial industry. … so now seems like a good time to remind you that having a strong print production agency to support these types of projects is not a thing of the past. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> is a digital agency, but we would never want to downplay the important role print assets can have on your multi-platform marketing experience.

In an effort to ramp up their digital footprint and avoid looking outdated, many banks and financial institutions have put print in the backseat or abandoned it all together. That being said, a healthy, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">well-rounded marketing strategy</a> should always include a few tangible, print elements. This is especially important in educating new customers about your banking products and capabilities.

To get you started, here are four signs that your bank could use the help of a new print production agency.

<strong>Sign 1: You have no print assets</strong>

Well, it might go without saying … but if you don’t have any print assets, it might be time to get a new <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print production agency</a>. Although digital banking and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">financial apps</a> are very popular and have made leaps and bounds in terms of usability and – perhaps more importantly – security, risk adverse and traditional customers still crave the impression of privacy and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">exclusivity print materials</a> can provide. There’s no question that many people don’t want to go to the bank to deposit checks anymore, or might want to receive all their statements online; but the market is filled with fickle customers. Those same banking clients can benefit tremendously from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">print material</a> that educates them about their financial options or helps them understand their investments and accounts. These assets don’t need to replace your digital content, they should complement and support it. Let a print production agency help you understand where that balance lies and what types of print materials are most popular and effective.

<strong>Sign 2: Your brochures look like you made them on Microsoft Paint...</strong>

On the flip side, if you DO have print assets, but they look like something your intern created on Microsoft Paint in 1999, it’s time to hit the reset button. Forget about those trifolds and one pagers. There are so many more <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative-branding-agency/business-printing-services/"">exciting print options</a> available today than there were even three or four years ago. From unique business cards and tear aways, to laser cutting and foiling: if you’ve been away from the print game for awhile, you’re going to feel like you entered a brave new world. The best news is that many of the most eye-catching and customizable print options are very cost-effective. A print agency can help you understand what competitive banks are using, how it’s working, and where print makes sense in your broader marketing mix.

<strong>Sign 3: You don't give specifics in print</strong>

Another way you can use a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print production agency</a> is to curate your content. One of the biggest reason print assets aren’t effective is because they don’t give enough relevant information to inspire potential banking customers to pick up the phone, log online, or head to your branch. In this highly regulated, and complex industry, it can feel counterintuitive to include too much content that might confuse or mislead customers. Let a content specialist help you translate all the technical details into something digestible and consumable that meets any and all guidelines your industry, while giving customers enough information to – well – even know what you’re talking about.

<strong>Sign 4: You don't know how to link your digital efforts to print</strong>

Last, but certainly not least, you want all of the great work you’re doing offline to work for your online. And vice versa. A good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print production agency</a> will help you literally repurpose content or adapt material for web and traditional consumption. Design elements may be similar, but not identical. Wording may be similar, but not identical. And so forth.… and with banking, the details matter, even down to those last two decimal places.

10 things social media management companies do for resorts,"<p class=""p1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/social-media-influencer-marketing"">Social media</a> management is so important in the tourism and hospitality industry. Bad reviews can devastate (or dramatically boost) hotel sales, and review sites and referral sources are king. Follow these simple best practices to ensure your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/social-media-influencer-marketing/social-media-marketing-company"">social media management</a> team is doing enough for you right now.</p>
<strong>1. Nail your profiles:</strong> Before you do anything else get your profiles set up. Correctly. That means your cover photo and profile picture should seamlessly work together. That means your Twitter handle shouldn’t be too similar to other users. That means your Google+ listing and TripAdvisor site should be claimed. No excuses.

<strong>2. Promote pictures like crazy:</strong> Nothing sells hospitality like a picture. Every cliché you can think of is true. Seeing IS believing and a picture IS worth a thousand words. These things sound cheesy, but they are true. Vacations are an emotionally driven purchase, so put your resort’s best foot forward in pictures to inspire your future guests and help them envision themselves on your property.

<strong>3. And … just promote:</strong> During the 2008 economic dip, almost every resort and hotel kicked off an aggressive discount and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promotion strategy</a>. Unfortunately, customers are now trained to expect promotions, special offers, and giveaways when booking hotels. Use this expectation to your advantage by asking your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/agency"">social media agency</a> how you can leverage your social platforms and best followers to make these opportunities lucrative while avoiding the temptation to give away the farm.

<strong> 4. Make social media uniquely yours:</strong> Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/"">social media monitoring</a> tools to discover trending hashtags, topics, and pages then adapt those trends to your brand. Put a spin on popular hashtags, or kick off a social sharing and tagging campaign that lets customers share their experiences with your brand. These tactics will help you break through the clutter in this saturated market.

<strong> 5. Service is everything:</strong> <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">Social media management</a> tools can help you monitor and respond to service issues. When people take to Twitter to vent about your brand, respond. When people give you a positive review on Yelp, thank them. We know this can be time consuming, so don’t be afraid to recruit an agency to give you a little extra support.

<strong>6. Partner promotions:</strong> Work with a loyalty program like Garnet Hill to host a giveaway or contest. The giveaway is good for them and the exposure is good for you. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Social media management agencies</a> can actively find and arrange these types of mutually beneficial <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">partnership</a> opportunities to keep you at the top of mind when customers are considering their next vacation.

<strong>7. Don’t be afraid to host events:</strong> Imagine a guerilla marketing campaign promoting your tropical resort in the New York City subway in the dead of winter inviting commuters to take a picture in a green-screen photo booth projecting them into the sun. The smell of sunscreen and coconut oil or sound of drums will be the icing on the cake. No matter what market you’re in, event marketing can have a global reach. You just might need a social agency who knows how viral event marketing really works.

<strong>8. Don’t forget about locals:</strong> Many resorts and hotels offer locals’ discounts but don’t spend a lot of time actively marketing to people in their own backyard who might be looking for a staycation or want to spend food and beverage dollars on site. Due to proximity, these customers are easy to reach and can be motivated with very little effort. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">Social media</a> is one of the best and easiest ways to engage this audience – and they shouldn’t be overlooked.

<strong> 9. Schedule everything:</strong> We get it. You’re busy. And social media is hard to quantify. Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media management tools</a> to schedule your posts, content updates, and social outreach so you don’t have to worry about these important initiatives slipping through the cracks if (and when) your days get away from you.

<strong>10. Track your work:</strong> If you are just building your social media presence, you can’t expect huge results overnight. Track your benchmark presence and impact and then set realistic, time-bound and measurable social media goals.

How your tourism brand can benefit from the $70B VR industry,"A little over a year ago when the Oculus Rift, the first mainstream <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/virtual-reality-vr-video/"">virtual reality machine</a>, was released to the public, some tourism marketing brands feared the technology could make travel obsolete. As this technology continues to improve, we beg to differ. By 2020, <a href=""https://www.tnooz.com/article/virtual-reality-tourism-marketing/"">Tnooz projects</a> that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/virtual-reality-vr-video/"">virtual reality</a> will be a $20 billion business primed for the hospitality and tourism industry. The reality - virtual or not - is that machines can't fully replace the experience of travel (yet) ... but they can augment it. As digital marketers, we need to harness this incredible potential to capture travelers' imaginations and send them to places ... both figuratively and literally ... that they have only dreamed about.

<strong>Use virtual reality to promote a destination or experience:</strong>

One of the most obvious ways to use virtual reality to support tourism marketing is at the top of the marketing funnel. In other words, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">brand can use virtual reality</a> the same way the film industry uses previews to entice and attract potential movie-goers. Instead of a replacement, consider virtual reality a ""teaser"" or ""trailer"" for your property or destination. And if photos and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">videos</a> are the most engaging content digital marketers have available, then live-action, 3D, interactive experience is probably one level up. More than 75% of Facebook content is image-based; and videos garner triple-digit click ratios compared to text and copy-based emails. This is especially true for the tourism and hospitality industry because you're selling an experience, rather than an object.

Many brands are already creating<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/virtual-reality-vr-video/""> virtual reality-friendly YouTube videos</a> and blogs where people who have a virtual machine can simply press play, plug in their phone, and experience another dimension. Virtual lovers can swim with sharks, explore haunted houses, and take in the sights and sounds of world-class kitchens. Each virtual video projects the viewer into their desired atmosphere, creating a truly sensory experience that decidedly leaves them wanting more. The 360-degree visual stimulation makes the viewer feel like they are so close to the action ... yet they can't truly interact with, touch, smell, or feel the environment. Talk about one effective preview.

<strong>Use virtual reality to...augment reality:</strong>

The precursor and complement to virtual reality is augmented reality. Augmented reality apps allow a user to overlay maps, interest points, photos, trivia, or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social opportunities</a> on top of the world around them. When combined with a virtual reality experience, the results transform museum exhibits into interactive experiences, make tourist destinations that are off limits due to dangerous conditions or construction accessible, or allow the average visitor to experience something they couldn't normally. Think: feeding pandas in a zoo, participating in a rocket launch at a science museum, or climbing ancient, crumbling ruins in the tropics.

In this way, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/virtual-reality-vr-video/"">virtual reality</a> can become an add-on marketing opportunity to enrich the vacation experience and create a deeper emotional bond for your visitors. Virtual reality can't replace the feeling of a massage, or the taste of a Michelin star restaurant; but it can work alongside those experiences to either purposefully contrast them or add extra value to those experiences themselves.

<strong>Virtual reality also unlocks non-traditional tourism options:</strong>

Perhaps less obviously, virtual reality also allows individuals who otherwise could not travel for physical, mental, or even monetary reasons, to experience something incredible. While an able-bodied athlete might not choose a virtual reality experience over hitting the slopes, someone suffering from an injury or disability may be energized and invigorated by this singular opportunity. Virtual reality gives tourism and travel companies the chance to infuse inclusivity and sensitivity into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">their brand voice</a> -- which is something that provides a benefit to our shared communities and appeals strongly to the millennial purchaser.

Together, you can be on the cutting edge of this emerging trend and lead the change in this exciting industry.",,2/15/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Enlight1.jpg,tourism-brand-can-benefit-virtual-reality-industry,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
The art of nostalgia: Marketing to the new millennial mindset,"Miami's new Brickell City Center - an interactive, luxury shopping concept that blends urban design, food, entertainment, and commerce together - is living proof of the new ""new"" millennial mindset. The Center's eco-friendly, temperature-regulating ""sky ribbon"" guides pedestrians along a suspended path among the high rises of Miami's financial district. Along the way, they'll find unique dining options, like professional golfer Erni Els' restaurant, and one-of-a-kind shopping experiences, like Saks Fifth Avenue's most luxurious store to date (complete with a marble staircase, five star restaurant, wine bar, personal shopping salon, and shoe library). At first blush, this opulent shopping center might seem just plain opulent; but underneath the glitz and glamour expected of the Magic City, an emerging trend is shining through.

<strong>Debunking the millennial myths:</strong>

To put it simply: Millennials are spending less time on their phones and craving authentic, real world experiences. You might call it a correction on a generation that over-rotated into the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital</a> world. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/technology/millennial-social-media-usage.html?_r=0"">According to the New York Times</a>: ""[Generation X] adults 35 to 49 were found to spend an average of 6 hours 58 minutes a week on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">social media</a> networks, compared with 6 hours 19 minutes for the younger [Millennials]"".

While that isn't a dramatic difference, this figure does help debunk the pervasive myth that millennials are social-obsessed narcissists who can't tear themselves away from their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/account-based-marketing-services/"">digital devices</a>. The reality is, millennials don't spend more time on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a> than the generation before them ... in fact, they spend less. While over 90% of the United States' population has access to smartphones, the digital generation spends less than an hour a day on social networks. That's a pretty encouraging statistic for those who worry we are losing touch with the world around us.

<strong>Marketing to the real millennial audience:</strong>

As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">digital marketers</a>, it also means we need to stop stereotyping millennials. Aside from being the fastest growing demographic with disposable income to burn, our youngest generation isn't that much different from the baby boomers or Generation X in terms of attitudes toward financial responsibility and work-related matters. <a href=""http://time.com/money/4030036/millennials-boomers-buying-experiences/"">Time magazine</a> cites a PwC study that indicates, “the similarities in attitudes across generations are striking. More than 60% in both [millennial and baby boomer] generations agree that work interferes with their personal life. Both generations highly value things like flexible hours, job sharing and telecommuting"". Marketers have a tendency to assume the only way to reach the millennial market is by bombarding them in the digital world or appealing to the stereotype of a spoiled millennial demanding more flexibility and more pay for less work from behind the anonymous screen of their sleek, new laptop. But are we getting it all wrong?

While millennials, having grown up with digital devices in their hands, may be more adept with or eager to adopt new technology than previous generations, these studies show that the digital world isn't entirely replacing traditional means of connecting, but rather, augmenting it.

Millennials spend more money on experiences as opposed to material goods than any other generation, according to that same PwC study. They spend less time on social media than their older siblings, and they have the same values as their parents. Who would have guessed? That means that having a holistic, multi-channel, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital</a>, <i>and </i><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative-branding-agency/print-advertisement/"">non-digital</a> strategy is the best way to reach this audience. Sure, they are comfortable consuming integrated advertisements disgusted as clever Instagram posts ... but they are also equally (if not more inclined) to be moved by a memorable, guerilla event campaign.

Millennials are unequivocally the most important consumer group as they continue to mature and take on the majority purchasing share in the market. Today's leading digital marketing trends aren't about being everywhere at once or spraying and praying across digital channels. The most effective <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">digital marketing techniques</a> hinge on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">understanding how your audience</a> sees the world, anticipating what information your customers need, and how they like to consume it. Striking the critical balance between digital spend and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">traditional marketing</a> efforts is as much an art as it is a science. And millennials are all about balance. Balance between the digital and real world. Balance between their professional and personal lives. And balance in how they spend their income.

Close out the year with a bang: Rockin annual report design trends,"Unless you strongly identify with Monica from the hit 90's television show Friends, chances are you probably don't get too excited when you think about the prospect of reading or creating an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative-branding-agency/annual-reports/"">annual report</a>. Everyone else: relax. It's not as bad as it sounds. In fact, some of this year's best design trends translate perfectly into the new gold standard for innovative annual reporting. The combination of design and data transforms raw information into highly engaging - dare we even say entertaining - narratives for your stakeholders, customers, and employees. If you're still not convinced, here are a few of the hottest trends to transform your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/annual-report-services/"">annual report</a>.

<strong>Start with a story:</strong>

When most people think of an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative-branding-agency/annual-reports/"">annual report</a>, they immediately think about numbers, accounting reports, and your business's bottom line. All of these elements are important when recapping your year, but that doesn't mean there isn't room to share some of the year's highlights along the way. If you've enjoyed a transformative year of growth, shout it from the rooftop. If your company has renewed its focus on sustainability, or released a new product line, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/annual-report-services/"">annual report</a> is the place to share these milestones.

The modern consumer and stakeholder is accustomed to consuming massive amounts of content woven into almost every aspect of their lives. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">Social media</a>? Check. Image-based advertising? Check. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">Video and multimedia</a>? Check. Today's best digital marketers seamlessly blend narratives across channels, devices, and formats. It makes sense, then, that your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/annual-report-services/"">annual report</a> would mirror this trend. While you don't need to include a ton of content, adding a human element to your annual report sets the tone for your results, primes the reader about what to expect, and draws them into the most important details you hope to highlight. Consider including your mission statement, customer quotes, board member profiles, images, or information about your year to set the stage. Remember, you don't want to detract from your actual reporting, but a little story goes a long way. Our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/"">creative</a> design team can help you strike the perfect balance between fact and fun.

<strong>Infographics link results and themes:</strong>

Once you've created a clear storyline, introduce your main pieces of data using easy-to-consume <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">infographics</a>. Even the most ardent readers and data-junkies might be tempted to skim your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/annual-report-services/"">annual report</a> before deciding whether to read more deeply, or determining what areas they want to explore. Choose your choicest figures and pull them out. To do this, ask yourself what you would want to share if you only had 15-seconds to do it, and go from there. Your infographic is essentially your annual report's elevator pitch, so don't be afraid to ask your analysts and agency partner what information is most important.

Infographics are a major <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">digital design trend</a> because they can quickly and effectively share critical information without getting lost in the mathematical weeds. And did we mention they are highly shareable? That's right: your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative-branding-agency/annual-reports/"">annual report</a> could go viral. Infographics help you draw a link between numbers and your readers' day-to-day world. This is especially effective when communicating to a broad audience spanning from executives and analysts, to consumers and enthusiasts. We like to think of infographics as a gateway between non-technical readers, and the people who interpret data best. When created properly, they can make your most critical figures accessible to everyone.

<strong>Let your brand shine: </strong>

Chances are, you'll still want to include a deep dive into your company's performance in your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/creative-branding-agency/annual-reports/"">annual report</a>. Whether you do that in the body of the document or use an appendix, you can keep this information consistent and engaging by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">letting your brand shine</a> through. Use your company's typography, color scheme, spacing principals, and image filters alongside your reporting. This creates visual consistency and interest even when presenting data straight up.

Love always wins,"<strong>Love Always Wins</strong>
By: BIGEYE Posted on February 14, 2017

<em>In the midst of tragedy came an outpouring of love into our city from around the world, reminding us that love will always beat hate.</em>

&nbsp;

This Valentine’s Day, we want to celebrate love. The love of a community. This past year, the Orlando community has unified and strengthened in unimaginable ways, reminding everyone that love always wins.

&nbsp;

<em>Initial response</em>

In the first 17 hours following the shooting, 32,680 people donated almost 1.3 million dollars. In total, 372 pints of blood were donated and used to help victims. In addition to the local response that the Orlando Pulse shooting experienced, global outreach and support was widespread. LGBT pride was honored in many different countries. Through parades, lights, and flowers, the Pulse shooting brought together society in a special way.

&nbsp;

<em>Local Aftermath</em>

Orlando Health gave back to the community by not billing victims of the Pulse Nightclub Shooting resulting in 5 million dollars of unreimbursed costs. Over 50,000 individuals attended the Orlando candlelight vigil with crowds chanting “Orlando United”. As the Orlando community strived to lend support to those impacted by the Orlando Pulse shooting, individuals assisted in all the ways they could. Vigils were held to show the community’s utmost support for victims families, as local companies helped in all the many ways they could.

&nbsp;

<em>Global Support</em>

After the news of the Orlando Pulse shooting was received by the public, people didn’t hesitate to lend a helping hand. Organizations and politicians from around the world instantly began fundraising efforts and sharing messages of support to show their commitment to our community. President Obama and Joe Biden traveled to Orlando, Florida to meet with survivors and families of victims. The Eiffel Tower shined in the colors of a rainbow to honor victims and jetBlue offered free flights to/from Orlando for immediate family/domestic partners of those affected by the shooting.

<strong>#PrayForOrlando #Pulse #ThoughtsAndPrayers</strong>",,2/14/2017 10:30,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/February-Infographic_FBskin.jpg,love-always-wins,publish,,Middle,0,open,0
68% data is wrong: marketing sources mean reduced blindspots,"As one of our closest data partners asks: what if you walked into your CEO's office and told her that 68% of your data was wrong? Chances are, the conversation isn't going to go well. That exact statistic is the possible gap <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">digital marketers</a> face when trying to accurately track data online. This metrics case study reminds us that customers can opt-out of cookie tracking, device switching can create misleading data, and a wide variety of variables, from faulty pixels to conflicting IP addresses and outdated operating systems, can interfere with the accurate tracking of your customer.

While attribution modeling can't entirely eliminate that 69% of data ""pollution"", it can dramatically reduce the number. The key to successfully understanding omni-channel marketing behavior is linking a variety of data sources together. If you are new to this process, it may seem a little daunting or overwhelming.

To get started, follow these four simple steps (and don't forget that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">we're here to help</a> set up a sustainable analytics program whenever you're ready).

<strong>   1. Start with digital tools: </strong>The easiest tools to implement are online tracking software. Whether you go with ""freemium"" models such as Google Analytics or more robust options such as Adobe Analytics, they provide the foundation for your attribution model and eventual testing framework. Create a benchmark for your target KPIs such as page views, conversions, or online revenue and use that baseline to inform your spend changes and testing variations.

<strong>   2. Link your CPM program: </strong>Next, you need to connect your customer engagement activities into your baseline. Platforms such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">StrongMail</a> and SalesForce connect seamlessly to most web analytics tools, making your life a lot easier. Once you link anonymous website activity to actual customer and prospect accounts, you can begin to understand how customers are moving in and out of the marketing funnel.

<strong>   3. Supplement with social: </strong>Most <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media platforms</a> offer some version of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">data tracking</a> and bigger analytics platforms, such as AdobeSocial, are made to connect directly to your other data repositories. The return on investment for social media can be difficult to track, so mapping your social spend against your web baseline will help you understand what impact you're driving.

<strong>   4. Offline metrics: </strong>Offline behavior is often one of the hardest channels to track because it requires manual input. To work around this, consider using an offering trigger at the point of sale that is specific to your offline marketing efforts so you can begin measuring these results. For example, consider a different promo code for your radio ads, print campaigns, and in-store purchases.

And those four steps are just to begin collecting the data you need to begin <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">analyzing</a> and creating an attribution model. In other words, teamwork is key. Realize that many departments will likely need to work together to get an accurate understanding of how all your channels are performing. This can feel counterintuitive in some organizations where work is highly soloed; but if you can drive a collaborative mindset, you can save money across your entire organization and revolutionize your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/""> marketing strategy</a>.",,3/26/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_1316.jpg,multiple-marketing-sources-reduce-blindspots,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
5 reasons your business should invest in content marketing,"It seems like everyone is talking about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a>. In fact, according to the <a href=""http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2016/07/interactive-content-research"">Content Marketing Institute</a>, 75% of brands using interactive content plan to increase their content distribution in 2017. But if your mom taught you anything in middle school it was probably that, just because everyone else is doing something, it doesn't mean you should too. We never recommend our clients jump on trends unless there's a defensible reason behind those strategies. Before you join the content wave, we're going to tell you why your business should invest in content marketing so you can make an informed decision. Spoiler alert: it's a great investment.

<strong>     1. </strong><strong>Consumers are increasingly less trusting of paid marketing:</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">Social media</a> has made it difficult for brands to hide their values, products, or services behind a sheen of marketing razzle-dazzle. People are constantly snapping and posting pictures, videos, sound bites, and reviews onto the internet via <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">blog posts and social channels</a>. And because paid advertisers would never shout their faults or weaknesses from the rooftop, most people believe customer-generated content is a more reliable source of honest information about a product. A good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">content marketing strategy</a> builds from and mimics customer-generated material so the messaging you have in market matches the good feedback you're receiving and addresses areas of opportunity your customers are pointing out.

<strong>     2 . Content marketing augments your brand messaging:</strong>

Use your paid efforts as your thesis statement and content marketing as supporting proof. No matter how prevalent user content is, you still need paid advertising to control and build your foundational brand storyline. Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> to augment and prove the validity of your paid efforts. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">Create a blog</a>, link to outside content, and build your site as a trusted source of information. All these tools back up your paid efforts to give customers enough confidence in your brand claims to choose your company over the competition.

<strong>     3. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/seo-search-engine-optimization/"">SEO</a> and SEM still matter: </strong>

It may sound simple, but it's worth noting: search engine optimization and marketing are still a big part of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">brand awareness process</a> at the top of the marketing funnel. This is especially true if you have a regional business that would benefit from local search discovery. There is no better way to ensure your website and company rank on your preferred search engine than by creating relevant, meaningful, and timely content. It takes search engines approximately three months to fully index and catalogue content updates, so publish content early and often to stay current.

<strong>     4. Content starts a conversation with your customers: </strong>

Not everyone will like your brand. Some people will absolutely love it. Instead of fighting the inevitable bell curve of opinions, lean into your customers' conversations using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">content marketing</a>. Shy away from generic or vague content and opt for big, bold information that will inspire a response from your clients. Even negative feedback lets you know how you are performing and gives you a baseline from which to grow. There's a reason they say all <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/media-press-release-services/"">publicity</a> is good publicity. While we aren't advocating you take a ""shock jock"" approach to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">content strategy</a>, we do encourage you to create authentic, interesting material that will truly engage your audience.

<strong>    5. Content is the most powerful tool in your marketing tool box:</strong>

Most importantly, your business needs content marketing because it helps you understand how your customers are searching for information and interpreting your brand values. You can test content to see what is most effective and learn from content that is not. As you fine tune the creation process, you'll be able to plug and play content across a wide variety of marketing channels, letting you be more agile in the marketplace and adapt to your unique marketing needs.

True or false: Myths about cross-channel attribution marketing,"Over the next three years, more than 73% of brands plan to increase their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">marketing analytics</a> spend in an attempt to understand the ubiquitous notion of attribution marketing, according to <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2014/12/02/cross-channel-attribution/&amp;refURL=https://cfl.dropboxstatic.com/&amp;referrer=https://cfl.dropboxstatic.com/"">Forbes </a>. Attribution, or cross-channel marketing is a relatively new trend that has taken the digital world by storm and attempts to assign value to each channel touch point your customers interact with across the purchase journey. You can learn more about what attribution marketing is and why it's important for your business in our recent blog post, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/marketing-attribution-matters-business"">here</a>. As our clients delve into this new discipline, we want to dispel a few common misconceptions about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/marketing-attribution-matters-business/"">what attribution marketing can</a> and cannot do so you can make the most of your analytics efforts.

<strong>Myth 1: Attribution can't be accurately measured, so it can't accurately forecast sales</strong>: It's true that there are blind spots when trying to accurately measure attribution. When consumers switch between devices, are drawn to action by offline advertising efforts, or revisit digital content across a variety of channels before purchasing, it can be difficult to track their journey or assign an exact value to how those channels impacted their decision making process. But just because we can't measure everything, doesn't mean it isn't valuable. Or accurate. Despite these shortcomings, attribution modeling still presents a more accurate picture than traditional analytics, which only assigns value to the first or last channel a customer touches. In this way, attribution takes us one step closer to perfection -- even if we aren't quite there yet.

<strong>Myth 2: Predictive models aren't accurate enough:</strong> To that point: predictive modeling based on cross-channel attribution can be upwards of 80-90% accurate depending on your sample size and the type of data used to create a forecast model. While we may not have perfect models, testing can get us pretty close. Even at lower confidence intervals, attribution modeling provides directional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">insight into your customers' behavioral patterns</a>, purchase path, and communication preferences. All this information can inform other, more traditional tests with easily measured KPIs. No testing is completely accurate, or can guarantee that customers will always perform the same way given the same set of variables; but it can help marketers invest more money in the right channels at the right time to meet their customers' needs.

<strong>Myth 3: Adaptive marketing and attribution marketing have nothing to do with each other:</strong> We're always shocked at how infrequently cross-channel marketing is used as a tool to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">improve adaptive marketing</a>. As automated testing and targeting becomes more common, adapted marketing helps businesses adjust their advertising spend on the fly as real-time data finds the perfect marketing mix. This automated fine-tuning process can be improved using attribution data to balance out your spend across channels. Adaptive marketing optimizes spend in each channel silo, while <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/marketing-attribution-matters-business/"">attribution marketing</a> zooms out to optimize your entire marketing budget. Linking your data across channels is the number one challenge when using attribution to improve adaptive marketing, so work with your agency partner on the best ways to do this quickly and effectively.

<strong>Myth 4: Attribution marketing means you have to be everywhere at once: </strong>Today's marketers feel a constant pressure to be everywhere at once. There are so many marketing tools -- from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print</a> and television, to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> and PPC, to earned and event coverage -- it's hard to know how and when to spend. This can tempt even the best marketers to try to do a little bit of everything. The problem is that very few companies have the resources to be everywhere at once without breaking their budget or tanking their ROI. Attribution marketing decreases the pressure to be everywhere to everyone by helping you understand which channels are most valuable to your best clients and where your biggest areas of opportunity to invest are.

<strong>Myth 5: Attribution marketing is a digital term:</strong> Although cross-channel marketing is easiest to track between digital channels (i.e., email to social to lead capture, to close), it's important to remember that offline <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">influencers</a> such as store <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promotions</a>, merchandising, and traditional advertising can all influence customers to return to their devices or begin searching for your product for the first time. Instead of thinking of cross-channel marketing as a digital term, think of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/marketing-attribution-matters-business/"">attribution marketing</a> as a digital tool that transcends the physical world. We know...pretty deep, right? The offline channel is just as valuable as your online content when creating a holistic picture of your customer, so don't fall into this classic attribution pitfall.

<strong>Myth 6: Assuming your agency is already doing this:</strong> Many clients think their agencies are already modeling attribution as part of the standard testing process. Unfortunately, this isn't true.At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we are pioneering attribution data capture and testing because we believe it is one of the most powerful tools to help small- and medium-sized businesses spend their marketing dollars more intelligently. When choosing an agency partner, don't assume they are aware of or have the tools to track this emerging trend. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Contact us</a> today about how we can help your business or how to know whether your current agency is the best fit.",,3/24/2017 16:30,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Enlight9.jpg,cross-channel-attribution-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
What is marketing attribution & why it matters to your business,"Imagine that you launched a new retargeting campaign yesterday that serves website visitors a mobile Facebook ad after they browsed items in your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce platform</a> on their laptop. Now imagine that today you emailed your newsletter database a 20% off coupon code to kick off the spring season. When a customer comes into your store to purchase that product and use their 20% off code, do you credit the website for educating them about their purchase, the Facebook ad for reminding them to buy, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing campaign</a> that served them the discount, or the store for their point of sale support? The answer to this question is important when planning where to invest your marketing dollars.

According to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/economic-impact-study-services/"">research</a>, 90% of consumers switch channels and devices -- such as cell phone to tablet, or online to offline -- to ""accomplish a conversion goal, with 67% of people using multiple devices to subsequently shop online."" Marketing attribution allows you to understand the impact each of these devices, and their corresponding channels, have had on the customer journey. And understanding this impact allows you to optimize your marketing spend around the channels and tactics that are most beneficial and cost effective.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Single source attribution marketing: </strong>

Most marketers use what is called ""single touch"" attribution modeling, which gives full credit to either the first or last channel a customer ""touched"" before purchase. In our example, that would be either the website or the physical store venue, with no credit going to the Facebook ad or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email campaign</a>. Yet, it is unlikely that the brick and mortar location, or any other single channel really, deserves full credit for this purchase when assessing their return on investment.

Single source attribution marketing is commonly used because it is simple and easy to track. Stitching together how customers move between devices and marketing assets is difficult and sometimes limited, so we -- as marketers -- settle. The problem with settling is that many of us wrongfully believe that the data will normalize across channels because customers are always entering and exiting the purchase flow differently. Unfortunately, single touch attribution often leads us to believe that one marketing source is more valuable than others and doesn't inform you about your most valuable marketing channels. This makes it difficult to accurately assign marketing spend and can lead to over or under investments in a certain channel.

<strong>Multi-source attribution modeling: </strong>

A common solution to the single touch dilemma is to systematically weight each channel in the customer journey. There are lots of ways this can be done: linear attribution, time decay, u-shaped, and full-path attribution are just a few of the models striving to systematize omni-channel marketing. Bizible provides a detailed overview of some of these models in their blog post, <a href=""http://www.bizible.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-complete-list"">here</a>. Depending on your sales cycle, each multi-source model has pros and cons. Multi source attribution marketing is certainly more accurate than single source attribution, but still has blind spots. Namely, the difficulty of tracking users across and between devices or accurately standardizing which channel has the most impact on customers when using a ""one size fits all model."" If you are just dipping your toe into the attribution world, this is a great place to start. You can easily test and compare weighted attribution models to see which one is the most accurate for your business and use that as long as it suits your needs. While it may not be perfect, it will provide directional insight into where to scale your spend in a way single touch attribution cannot.

<strong>Algorithmic and fractional attribution: </strong>

The last, and most nuanced, form of attribution modeling is algorithm-based attribution. The goal here is to leverage big data from a variety of sources such as your CMS system, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">web analytics</a> platform, social metrics, traditional campaign ROI, and even physical POS information when it's available, to create a living, breathing attribution model that adapts based on how your customers are actually shopping.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Agencies</a> in particular have the power to do this because they can partner with large data organizations that help paint a complete picture of how, when, and where customers are switching between devices. This model assigns weight intelligently based on the amount of time customers spend on each channel, the frequency at which they use a platform or device, as well as where the sale and lead starts and ends. We firmly believe that as attribution modeling becomes a more standardized part of the budgeting process, this model (and the tools that support it) will become more prevalent.

Even with the most comprehensive algorithmic attribution system, we are still learning about and adapting to the shifting nature of consumer purchase behavior. Realize that perfection is not the goal -- yet. In our recent blog post <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/cross-channel-attribution-marketing"">debunking myths about attribution</a>, we shed light on why this methodology is so important regardless of its inherent limitations. This new and critical level of insight into your customer journey lets you serve your clients while doing right by your business at the same time. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Get in touch</a> today and we'll show you how.",,3/24/2017 16:30,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Enlight7.jpg,marketing-attribution-matters-business,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Attribution marketing unlocks optimal mix for on & offline efforts,"<p class=""Body"" style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">When people think about attribution marketing, they often think of it as a digital tool. Although this mindset is somewhat misleading, it makes sense because many of the earliest attribution models focused primarily on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">tracking digital touch points</a>. As our understanding of attribution has become more refined however, we know that the digital world is not the only channel that plays a part in the customer journey. Understanding your attribution model can help you plan for the best marketing spend possible and show you where to invest and where to scale back.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Online and offline channels feed each other in a constant loop. We know that television ads drive consumers to their mobile devices, and that many purchases start online and conclude in-store. One cannot exist without the other. This can lead marketers to believe that they need to be everywhere at once and, as we've said before, that simply isn't possible for most brands.</p>
<p class=""Body""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/last-click-attribution-last-place/"">Attribution modeling</a> allows you to test for the optimal marketing mix on and offline no matter what your budget may be. With a little bit of patience, you can test your way toward a successful balance between your initiatives. Finding the right mix starts with understanding your baseline success metrics. In our recent blog post about managing multiple sources of data (<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/multiple-marketing-sources-reduce-blindspots"">found here</a>), we explain the four key pieces of data you need to begin tracking to successfully start building an<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/analytics-key-unlocking-customer-journey/""> attribution model</a>: online data, CRM information, social metrics, and offline performance. Establish your data tracking methodology, generate a baseline of data, then set goals against that baseline. You'll begin understanding the right marketing mix as you decrease and increase spend across these channels and watch all your KPIs adapt in concert. While it's sometimes difficult to separate which channel is driving impact, attribution marketing begins to solve that question by assigning value to each channel along the conversion process.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Getting a leg up on your competition: </strong></p>
<p class=""Body""><b> </b>Once you establish a baseline and preliminary hypothesis about how your channels are influencing each other, you can begin getting a leg up on your competition by balancing your on and offline efforts for maximum impact. The good news is that, according to <a href=""https://contently.com/strategist/2014/11/24/35-content-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/"">Contently</a>, only 49% of marketers are successfully serving content aligned to the customers' purchase journey. That means, if you can unlock how much time customers are spending on and offline, your business will be ahead of the curve ... way ahead. Serving the right content to your customers based on their needs increases the likelihood that they will purchase and increase their lifetime customer value.</p>
<p class=""Body"">That's why we believe that it's better to have four quarters than ten times when assessing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">great marketing campaigns</a>. When you serve the right content at the right time, the amount of content or marketing spend is far less important than the impact it's having. Attribution marketing reduces costs by honing in on where to spend so you are focusing on that quality rather than quantity. When seeking a balance between your online and offline efforts, focus on how each of those channels can feed each other. Nothing you do online should be disparate from your offline efforts and vice versa. By creating content that works across channels, you can repurpose your assets as your mix becomes more intelligent.</p>

"New year, new trends: Break through social media noise in 2017","It seems there is always another trend to chase, another metric to follow, and another golden rule to adhere to, so we try to consolidate the most important pieces of information to help you make strong social media marketing decisions. Without further ado, here are our top five recommendations to break through the social media noise and clutter in 2017.

<strong>   1. Know your audience:</strong> Some brands are best suited for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">image-based social platforms</a> (e.g., travel, retail). Some brands are best suited for education- or networking-based social platforms (e.g., financial services, education). You get the idea. It’s important to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">understand your audience</a> so you can effectively choose which platforms to invest in and which platforms to steer away from. You don’t need to be everywhere for everyone to effectively <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">use social media</a> — you just need to be in front of the right people at the right time.

<strong>   2. Use every tool available:</strong> Once you pick a platform, use every single tool available to you. Facebook recently released a “donate” button for nonprofit organizations that can be added to event tags and fan pages, Snapchat just released customizable event filters to promote local and geo-based marketing efforts, and Instagram’s native image advertising seamlessly blends user-generated content with ads so effectively users don’t even know they are being served a campaign … just to name a few. Each platform has certain strengths, so carefully consider how you can use every tool int our toolbox to maximize your reach and customer engagement.

<strong>   3. Promote customer content:</strong> One of the most effective forms of social advertising — that also happens to be free — is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promoting customer content</a>. Simply sharing, commenting on, and promoting blog entries, social posts, and photos from past customers or potential customers can make your audience feel deeply connected to your brand and dramatically increase their likelihood to buy. For example, Nike is notorious for retweeting and liking budding athlete’s posts. When a first-time runner gets real-time social interaction as they post to the Nike+ app or Tweet about their run, they instantly feel connected to and supported by the brand in a real and authentic way that inspires action, it makes them feel good as an athlete, and will likely result in future goodwill and purchases.

<strong>   4. Test to invest:</strong> Because social media gives marketers access to such a large body of people, it’s an easy place to begin testing and targeting your marketing campaigns. Don’t invest in any type of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media campaign</a> without testing it first. Almost every platform has built-in testing tools that allow you to run multiple variations at once, track KPIs, and measure your success over time. Ignore these at your own risk. Testing allows you to verify what content speaks to your audience and helps you break through the competition and clutter.

<strong>   4. A small part of the whole:</strong> Realize that social media needs to be part of your larger <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing strategy</a> that should ideally extend on- and offline, across traditional and non-traditional marketing platforms, and seamlessly support your customer no matter what information they need. Social media often links one channel to another, making it an integral part of cross-channel <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">marketing strategy</a>. Social media drives people from one platform to another and pushes people naturally toward the point of sale or call to action, so choose your success metrics accordingly. Social media can be very effective at driving customers into certain parts of the funnel, rather than simply going for the sale.

Kim Kardashian (& authority marketing) are important to your brand,"We aren't exactly saying that you need to become the next Kim Kardashian...but we do think you should be <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">using influencers</a> like her to leverage your brand.

As Dan Kennedy, known as the ""Godfather of Direct Marketing,"" once said, according to the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-horn/authority-marketing-is-a-_b_4918759.html"">Huffington Post</a>: “The simple truth is, if you aren’t deliberately, systematically, methodically — or rapidly and dramatically — establishing yourself as a celebrity, at least to your clientele and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">target market</a>, you’re asleep at the wheel, ignoring what is fueling the entire economy around you, neglecting development of a measurably valuable asset.”

<strong>So, what exactly is authority marketing?</strong>

<strong> </strong>In other words, authority marketing is an inexpensive but highly effective tool for the modern business owner to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">increase their marketing reach</a> without necessarily increasing their paid spend. Take the budding ""athleisure"" brand Peony &amp; Me as an example. Peony is an offshoot of the Perry Ellis conglomerate that successfully broke out of its parent company's traditional image within the last year by carefully and narrowly <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">targeting local bloggers and influencers</a>.

The brand has a very low marketing budget that accounts for only a fraction of the Perry Ellis spend, and primarily focuses on Facebook ads and native Instagram ads. Peony is able to do this successfully because they realize that shares, buzz, and exposure from influencers popular within their target audience -- which aims to attract affluent, young professional, urban females -- is far more valuable than traditional marketing tactics. The Peony brand understands how the ""athleisure"" client likes to shop, what types of images and influencers they are drawn to and trust. Instead of spending money on mass advertising campaigns, Peony focuses on highly effective, targeted authority marketing efforts. They know a simple post of a popular blogger wearing a pair of Peony leggings can be more effective than a major PPC spend.

Authority marketing, which is sometimes called influencer marketing, turns prominent industry figures into brand ambassadors by encouraging them to interact with your products and organization. Their followers and fan base then become your audience as they take to s<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">ocial media to share their experiences</a>. You instantaneously expand your reach without increasing your spend.

<strong>Here's why it works:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Authority marketing works because people want to buy from other people (and brands) they know. In our world, where Twitter and Snapchat give ""regular people"" access to intimate and candid moments from their favorite celebrities, an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer endorsement</a> can feel like a highly personalized recommendation -- from someone who just happens to have hundreds of thousands of followers. This works for every industry, even those without an inherent ""celebrity culture,"" because even the most seemingly dry industry has rockstar pioneers and thought leaders who command respect and enthusiasm. The key is understanding who those influencers are and what channel they most naturally are already using to communicate with your target audience.<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/""> Authority marketing</a> is the ultimate referral.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>Secondly, authority marketing organically draws potential clients to your brand rather than pushing them through the door with a promotion or free trial. It's the age old ""pull vs. push"" marketing psychology theory. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">Authority marketing</a> allows you to pre-qualify leads and move customers through the purchase journey quicker and more effectively. When someone self-selects your brand based on an influencer recommendation, they are likely already more engaged with your products than someone who discovered your organization via a traditional media or advertising outlet. This allows you to spend less time at the top of funnel, educating your audience about your brand, and more on closing and loyalty techniques.</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>It's free. With the exception of any products or services you give to influencers to try and promote, this is 100% free marketing (which is our favorite kind). As long as you are choosing your influencers carefully, your break even point should be extremely low, with an exceptional return on investment. This is an effective tool at the local and national level and can start with a simple phone call or email asking a prominent figure within your industry whether he or she would try your product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
</ol>
To help you understand the<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-campaign-reporting-service/""> type of influencers</a> most suited for your brand, we can tailor a bespoke authority marketing plan for your brand that identifies which channels are most effective and what types of leaders will be most likely to inspire action within <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">your target audience</a>.

Is your company spending too much money on the wrong content?,"<p class=""Body"">We all know that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> are important elements of a well-rounded and engaging customer experience — in fact, we go deep on this topic in our recent blog post titled ""5 Reasons Your Business Should Invest in Content Marketing"", which you can <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/5-reasons-business-invest-content-marketing-2"">read here</a>. But how do you know if you're spending the right amount of money on the right content?</p>
<p class=""Body"">There’s no question that brands are spending more money on content than ever before. With over 64% of B2B marketers outsourcing the content creation process according to <a href=""http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/05/b2b-content-marketing-statistics-2014/"">TopRankBlog</a>, there is no shortage of content flowing into the marketplace. There is content everywhere, from <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">videos</a> to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">interactive emails</a>, to white pages, to webinars, and many others. But is it working? Calculating the ROI on content marketing can be challenging, and highly interactive content such as infographics and videos can be expensive. Before you invest another dollar in content creation, we recommend that you ask yourself these two questions:</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Question 1: If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it fall, did it actually happen?</strong></p>
<p class=""Body""> No, we aren’t trying to be cheeky with you. With so many marketing dollars going toward content creation, we have to wonder whether there is enough left over to effectively invest in the targeted distribution of that content. You might have the most engaging infographics in the world, but if your target audience isn’t seeing them, you’ve just wasted your budget.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Omni-channel marketing is the answer. Understand where your audience is already consuming content and which types of content they engage with most organically, then mimic their natural consumption patterns. Simple social listening tools, attribution marketing models, and A/B testing can help you understand your best customers’ behavior and begin targeting prospects with the right content, at the right time, in the right place.</p>
<p class=""Body"">This allows you to invest in your most valuable channels and begin plugging existing content into marketing mechanisms that will inspire action. You may find that you have enough content right now and that your dollars would be better spent targeting prospects with the amazing assets you have, rather than continuing to create work no one will see.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Question 2: Why are you writing your own content? </strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">If you find that you still do need content, we recommend flipping the creation process on its head. And don’t worry, we won’t tell your creative team we said so. While curated and professional content is hard to beat, it sometimes overshadows one of the most effective and free content creation resources available to you. Your customers.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Don’t fight it. Today’s consumers have a big voice. They are blogging and reviewing and posting everywhere. Use this to your advantage. By adopting your best customer-generated content and investing in distribution around those assets you accomplish three things. First, you reduce the cost of creating content. Second, you make those creators feel connected to your brand by elevating their opinions and efforts into the spotlight. And third, you expand your reach by utilizing your customers’ own spheres of influence and follower bases to support your distribution efforts. We agree, that sounds like a pretty amazing opportunity.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Right now, marketers spend close to 80% of their budget on content creation and only 20% on distribution. By flipping the content creation model, you just freed up that money you have been looking for to kick off your latest test and target campaign. You’re welcome.</p>
<p class=""Body""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Let us work with you</a> to perform a comprehensive content audit on your brand to understand which of your assets are strongest, where you should be promoting them, and how effective your current distribution strategy is. Together, we’ll make sure you never have to say you spent too much money on the wrong content.</p>",,4/1/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unnamed.jpg,spending-much-money-wrong-content,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"Omni-channel, Cross-channel, & Multi-channel Attribution, oh my!","Cracking the customer code shouldn't feel impossible. We're all customers, after all. Yet making marketing decisions can sometimes veer too far into Mad Men-style gut checks and intuition, or too far toward a clinical analysis of data that leaves out that emotional element. Attribution modeling -- whether you call it omni-channel, cross-channel, or<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/""> multi-channel</a> -- begins to solve this problem by blending data with common sense and human behavioral patterns.

Striking this balance is important in today's fast-paced, always-on market, where consumers have limitless choices, and unfettered access to information about your brand and products. As Mark Braydon, the Content Marketing Director at <a href=""https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/06/17/how-to-measure-the-success-of-digital-marketing-across-devices-and-platforms/"">Barclays UK</a> explains, “I really like the concept that the modern day marketer needs to be part-artist and part scientist. That blend is what I look for in my team. You need to know all the things that drive short-term interest and intrigue but you also need to be able to understand what impact that is having on some of your ongoing trading and performance metrics, and that is where the deep <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">analytical knowledge</a> is required."" Braydon also agrees that cross-channel <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/last-click-attribution-last-place/"">attribution modeling</a> is one of the most important tools marketers have at their disposal when trying to solve for the customer journey. For us, there are three main reasons to invest in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/last-click-attribution-last-place/"">attribution marketing</a>.

<strong>1. Attribution is the new digital currency: </strong>Traditional KPIs only reveal a piece of the puzzle as we explain in our recent blog post about how attribution unlocks your customer journey. While <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">web analytics</a> may reveal what your customers are doing, attribution helps you move beyond clicks and page views to a deeper, more intimate knowledge of your customers' motivations and preferences. There are still some limitations when creating attribution models (specifically, linking multiple devices and online and offline channels), but these gaps are getting smaller every day. As more people lean in to attribution modeling as a way to support their analytics programs, these gaps will become smaller and smaller until they disappear and attribution is the new king.

<strong>2.</strong><strong> Diving into big picture marketing: </strong>Even with gaps in attribution modeling, we already <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">know customers are starting and finishing their shopping experience</a> on different channels and across different devices. While this was occurring five or even ten years ago, the number of devices the average person has, and time spent on each of these devices, is increasing every year, making it even more important to understand the big picture customer journey rather than assuming that where someone starts their interaction with your brand is where you will earn their business. We predict that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">big picture marketing</a> will be one of the fastest growing trends of 2017 and biggest drivers for success in 2018. And attribution is the way to understand that trend.

<strong>3. </strong><strong>Breaking away from a one size fits all approach: </strong>Attribution modeling comes in many flavors: last touch, linear, decay, u-shaped, weighted ... you get the idea. Because attribution modeling attempts to understand customer motivation, you can adapt your models to fit the actual behavior you're seeing in real time. Attribution weighs and balances many variables, so, unlike static KPIs, you can adjust these variables to more accurately reflect what customers are doing and make decisions based on that information. It's true that no model can perfectly capture each and every customer journey, but these models do present a more sophisticated and nuanced picture of the purchase path. You can even use a combination of attribution reports and models to get closer to a full picture of your customer experience.

You probably already have several tools in place that can inform the foundation of an omni-channel strategy. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Let us take a look </a>at your current data and we'll help you link these to your customers' motivations and passions, so your clients are always a name and not just a series of numbers.",,4/7/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-10.jpg,multi-channel-attribution,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why last click attribution will leave you in last place,"For years, marketers have relied on last click attribution to assign value to their marketing campaigns. If you're unfamiliar with the term, you probably already understand the concept because it isn't a new idea -- we just have a new name for it. Last click attribution assumes that no matter how many times a customer has interacted with a brand prior to purchase, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promotion</a>, email campaign, television ad, or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">digital banner</a> that drove them to the point of sale gets the credit for that purchase. This is great news for the strategist and designer who created those campaigns and hopes to prove the positive value of their work, but bad for your business.

The problem with last click attribution is it also leaves critical supporting efforts out of the equation. This makes sense when you think about it. For example, it is unlikely that a brand new customer who has never heard about your brand would receive a random email and decide -- not only to open that unsolicited email -- but to purchase from it. More likely, that customer found your company on a search engine or saw an intriguing ad, interacted with your site, signed up for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email newsletter</a>, and purchased with some knowledge of your brand. If we rely solely on last click attribution, we might assume that email is the critical factor driving customers to purchase and scale back on the supporting content (and corresponding marketing spend) that, likely, captured that customer's attention in the first place.

<strong>Omni-channel attribution provides big picture marketing support:</strong>

Still not convinced? According to a study by one of the most reputable digital marketing sources, <a href=""https://www.clickz.com/3-reasons-to-go-beyond-last-click-attribution/42029/"">ClickZ:</a> ""customers interact with a brand 4.3 times over a two-day period before they finally make a purchase. In addition, the average U.S. shopper consults a total of 10.4 new and traditional media sources prior to purchasing."" The internet has given consumers access to more information and choices than ever before, which means purchases are not happening by accident. People are spending more time researching the brands and products that fit their values, needs, and use cases ... and they are finding what they are looking for. To be successful in today's market, your brand needs to have a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">presence across all the touch points</a> that inform and educate customers prior to purchase.

That's great advice in theory; but in practice, we understand your brand has budget limitations and can't realistically be everywhere at once. Omni-channel attribution helps you understand which channels are most effective so you can direct your resources to your most valuable marketing efforts. By understanding the big picture of how your customers are seeking information and making their purchase decisions, you can determine whether customers spent more time on your website reading white papers, or more time on review sites prior to clicking that email and cashing in on your latest promotion. That information allows you to invest accordingly.

<strong>Multi-channel marketing proves the purchase cycle is non-linear: </strong>

What you are likely to find is that the customer purchase cycle is non-linear. Traditional marketing funnels that suggest buyers move from education and discovery, through selection, toward purchase in a downward, narrowing motion are dead wrong. Instead of limiting your customer view to an antiquated behavior model, cross-channel attribution modeling reveals the circular nature of the modern consumer's journey and breaks free from the static funnel.

We know the funnel model has blind spots because if customers are, indeed, visiting 10 media sources and interacting with a brand 4.3 times prior to purchase, it is unlikely that they are following a linear purchase cycle. Attribution allows you to understand how they are moving in and out of the funnel to evaluate multiple brands at once, pressure testing your products before committing to a purchase, and using your content and marketing collateral to support the socialization of their purchases. The benefits of understanding this process allow you to move from a strictly transactional relationship with your customers and build meaningful interactions with them. It should go without saying that the stronger your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">brand's relationship is with its customers</a>, the bigger their lifetime value will be.

How to unlock the customer journey using marketing attribution,"Analytics have been a long-standing source of knowledge about the customer journey since the ability to track online behavior became available. But, just as we've evolved from the the days of Alta Vista and Ask Jeeves, so have our tracking methodologies. Marketing attribution modeling is the next wave in data collection and synthesis. That isn't to say that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">web analytics</a> have become obsolete. Analytics reveal the ""how:"" where has a customer surfed, what are they doing on the site, where are they completing activities, and what they are purchasing. Marketing attribution modeling supports this by providing insight into the customer journey itself. It reveals the ""why"" behind those activities. Analytics and attribution are a great pair.

Analytics fundamentally help you refine your experience, while attribution reveals what experiences are most effective. By optimizing both, you can tailor your budget to simultaneously invest in the platforms and channels that matter most, while choicefully making the enhancements that will make those investments most effective. Here's how it works.

<strong>Analytics provide foundational insight into marketing efforts: </strong>

Picture this: your shiny <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">new website</a> is up and running. You just launched a few digital test and target campaigns. Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media presence</a> is on point. And your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">prospect emails</a> are scheduled to send. Or so you think. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">Web analytics</a> drill down into the heuristic performance of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a> experience. You can track where customers are spending time on your site, where people are falling out of the e-commerce process, whether they are clicking your banners, how your social media presence is trending, and what they are searching to find your brand. This is the foundational information that allows you to understand whether the digital experience you created is working. What it doesn't reveal is the deeper motivations and behavioral drivers that make this experience successful.

<strong>Attribution goes deep on customer journey and behavioral modeling: </strong>

But what happens if you discover people are visiting your site, but not purchasing on it? How do you know whether clicks via your emails or via your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media channels</a> are more valuable? And how do you balance your marketing mix? Attribution modeling helps you answer these questions by revealing big picture behavior patterns such as device switching, online and offline performance, and engagement. Instead of considering each individual metric or KPI as a stand-alone measure of success, attribution creates a holistic picture that shows how all your marketing tools are working together. Attribution modeling answers four key questions that every marketer should know when trying to build an amazing customer experience.

When simply looking at KPIs, it's easy to focus solely on the last channel a customer visits before conversion, but there are many channels and factors that contribute to growth and retention. Attribution weighs each element and links them together so you can understand what's engaging and inspiring your customers toward action. This helps you determine where you can better support them and what information or channels might be missing from the equation.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li><em>What is the value of each of these touch points? </em></li>
</ol>
If you get stuck only focusing on the last place a customer visits before they convert, you might also be calculating your ROI incorrectly. Suppose a customer finishes a purchase using a link from an email, but they had originally heard about your brand via a digital banner, visited your store downtown, spent time on your website, and read social referral sites prior to purchasing. Calculating your ROI based on that one email campaign might look high (and may be extremely effective in reality), but leaves out the other factors that led to that purchase. Good planning starts with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">having the right information</a>.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li><em>Do customers have the right information at the right time along this journey? </em></li>
</ol>
Attribution also helps you understand how customers are moving in between channels, which gives you an understanding of what is engaging them. For example, you might discover that people aren't spending much time on your social channels, but average time spent per site on your customer testimonial page is high. This may suggest that your social content isn't focused enough on reviews and past customer experiences. Knowing where a customer spends her time and how she moves between your campaign touch points can help you place the right content in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">right places at the right moment</a> in the customer journey.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li><em>Are any efforts redundant or underutilized? </em></li>
</ol>
Similarly, this will tell you whether the balance of your spend is aligned to your customers' needs. In the same example above, you might find that investing in social media simply isn't as valuable as investing in site content. Attribution allows you to test these theories until you have found the sweet spot for your marketing efforts.

Read how Apple caught up to Google Play’s app feedback feature,"Apple’s App Store and Google Play have been neck to neck, with 2.2 and 2.8 million apps for download respectively. Both big-name brands have been striving to set the tone for developers and marketers hoping to break through the clutter with the “next big app.” … And on March 27th, Apple just tightened the race even more. Since 2013, Google Play has supported a feedback platform where app developers can request additional information from customers who rated their app. Apple originally limited the feedback loop in hopes of reducing the amount of customer service requests mistakenly filtering through the App Store. Their latest iOS release, however, debuted an entirely new app rating and feedback model that improves the customer and developer experience.

<strong>Why marketers should care?</strong>

If your target audience has mobile phones, you need to care about this. According to <a href=""http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/)"">Smart Insights</a>, apps account for 89% of mobile media time. This means that the majority of time your customers spend on their phones is inside an app. Additionally, most app usage helps customers solve a real task: order groceries, navigate, find transportation, purchase movie tickets – you get the idea. Reliable feedback about how their app is performing allows marketers to understand whether their app is valuable and invest dollars to support its functionality or invest those same dollars elsewhere.

Realizing that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">customers are consistently using apps</a> and expecting them to solve their day-to-day problems gives marketers another important tool when creating a holistic marketing experiences that engages their most valuable audience. Knowing how well your output is serving that audience is priceless. While you may hope your app is serving a need, knowing where you are doing well and where you are falling short can dramatically improve your adoption and usage metrics … which ultimately impacts your bottom line. Consistent, relevant, and clear feedback is as important for your brand as traditional data and analytics insights. Even a handful of thoughtful, qualitative reviews can provide key customer insight into areas of improvement.

<strong>How the new feedback system works:</strong>

Thankfully, Apple’s new feedback system helps you get there. Now, when customers complete a rating, developers can request additional information and ask questions to generate actionable feedback rather than just static comments. They can also reply to negative feedback or issues directly within the app to encourage goodwill and build a positive relationship. This allows developers to clarify confusing comments and get to the heart of the issue, rather than simply managing a flood of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/crisis-communication-company/"">customer service crisis</a>. The new system also limits the number of times developers can ask for feedback or a rating about an app in order to improve the overall customer experience for users who don’t want to participate in the feedback process.

These simple updates illustrate the important trade off of earned value (presumably from your app) and information from your customers. Most marketers believe you shouldn’t ask for information – whether that’s a review or an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email address</a> – until you are providing a clear benefit in exchange for that information. This model champions that natural give and take and will hopefully improve the quality of data developers are receiving while improving the overall customer experience. App customers now know that ratings can be used to improve their overall experience and will hopefully be more inclined to share bug fixes and customer service insight for a holistic feedback loop.

And the Oscar goes to... Cinema ads for multi-family properties,"<p class=""Body"">The average movie theater has approximately 200 to 300 seats filled with local residents, business owners, and future tenants, making it prime real estate (pun intended) to kick off a unique property marketing campaign. Cinema advertising, or the local advertisements that run before a movie screening, are a powerful way to increase exposure for your multi-family property without needing to do a ton of work. Movie theaters bring the community together in the same way a census or sample group might, making them an ideal place to test and target potential customer personas and tenant personalities. Here's why:</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>1. Cinema advertising is hyper-local:</strong> In most cases, people attending movie theaters live, work, shop, and play near by. With the exception of specialty theater experiences, such as mega-IMAX theaters or novelty concepts such as CineBistory, most theaters attract customers who live within a 15-30 mile radius of their location. If not less. If your goal is to expose potential residents to your multi-family property, you can literally handpick the neighborhood you want to<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/""> target by advertising</a> in theaters nearby that location or in neighborhoods with similar, complementary socioeconomic compositions.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>2. Location, location, location:</strong> If your multi-family property is near the theater you're advertising in, you also have the opportunity to showcase the local amenities of that area. Most movie theaters are near malls, shopping plazas, and walking promenades, serving as an anchor for local stores and restaurants. Appealing to potential residents may start with your property itself ... but your building is supported by the amenities, walkability, and comfort of the neighborhood itself. Use your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/""> cinema advertising</a> to highlight the experience they are already enjoying and how you fit into that pleasant moment and future memories.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>3. Cinema advertising is more customizable than you think: </strong>The average consumer tends to self-select into neighborhoods and locations that fit their lifestyle, which is why carefully placed cinema advertising can make your property marketing can feel personal, even in a crowded movie theater. Even though your ad may not appeal to every person in the theater, you can make fairly informed assumptions about your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">target audience</a> based on the location of the theater, type of experience the establishment offers, ticket price point, and movie selection itself. Don't be afraid to get specific in your ads. The more targeted your messaging, the more likely it is that your audience will remember the ad and act on it later.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>4. There's nothing quite like a captive audience:</strong> We hate to say it, but cinema advertising is impactful in part because audiences can't escape the repetition of and exposure to these ads. Even with the prevalence of smartphones and digital devices in the theater, pre-movie footage and advertising is somewhat inescapable for the average movie goer. Cinema advertising gives you the opportunity to drive your message home without investing tons of money in local television and radio ads, and as more and more people switch to streaming music options and cable-free television providers, understanding and adopting these opportunities will be an important part of local advertisers' success.</p>

Attribution = accurate measurement for customer touch points,"<p class=""Body"">Many marketers struggle to understand how to accurately measure the impact of each and every touch point that individual consumers are exposed to, across all devices, channels, and campaigns, both online and offline. And according to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Marketers-Still-Struggle-with-Cross-Channel-Measurement/1013216"">e-marketer</a>, only 60% of marketers use accurate measurement tools to evaluate their channel performance. Of that group, most track each channel on its own and then optimize performance evaluations and spend based on channel-specific results. Only 20% use attribution modeling to gain a clear picture of how each touch point is working together to create a holistic marketing mix, leaving the majority of marketers in the dark.</p>
<p class=""Body""><a href=""http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2014/09/24/beginners-guide-attribution-modelling"">The Drum </a>beautifully explains why that 20% needs to increase: ""the primary objective of attribution modeling, is to provide holistic, accurate information about the financial return [all your marketing] activities are delivering so you can refine them, adjust what you're doing, and use the same budget to deliver more value to your business and customer.""</p>
<strong>Taking the first step toward attribution modeling:</strong>
<p class=""Body"">Before you can begin seeing the big picture of how your marketing campaigns are working together, you need to have the right data collection tools in place. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">Online tracking tags</a> are a great place to start when measuring digital activity, but don't forget your offline channels as well. Use customizable promo codes and loyalty programs to start understanding offline behavior, then consider partnering with big data providers from reliable third party sources to round out the big picture. A trusted agency partner, like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, can help you understand which data is most important to your brand and how to find what you're looking for in the sea of data providers. Our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">attribution services</a> blend your data with external data to round out your blind spots and make your attribution models more accurate.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Choosing the right methodology:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">Once you're tracking the right information ... what do you do with it? This is where most marketers fail. It's easy to get information about how each channel is performing based on the KPIs and success goals for that channel. It's less simple to link the value of performance on one channel to another and evaluate how they are supporting each other. Attribution marketing is the first defensible, mathematical methodology to begin cracking that question. While attribution may not be able to answer every question perfectly yet, it is still a more nuanced and intelligent way<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/crisis-communication-company/""> to understand your customer</a> journey and make informed decisions about your marketing mix. You wouldn't make an accounting or revenue decision with only half the information -- why should marketing decisions be any different?</p>
The trick is choosing the right attribution model to frame your analysis. If you're just starting the journey toward attribution marketing, we can work with you to understand your business and choose which model makes the most sense for your business type. Typically, we recommend some form of weighted, curved, or machine learning approach that gives credit to each of your channels as customers move between devices and media formats along the path toward a sale. Unlike first or last touch attribution, which gives credit to the channel where customers either start or end their purchase journey, we believe that a weighted model more accurately mirrors the non-linear path most people take from discovery to point of sale.
<p class=""Body""><strong>Putting learnings into action:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">Use attribution to support your existing testing and analytics programs to make statements about your ROI rather than what's happening along the way.

Cosmetic marketing gets a makeover thanks to influencer marketing,"<p class=""Body"">We don't want to ruffle any feathers, but bloggers and influencers are slowly (or not so slowly depending on who you ask...) starting to replace <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print advertising</a> and editorial content. We aren't saying that beauty magazines have become obsolete, but platforms such as Pinterest and YouTube have made it faster and easier for the average beauty maven to find the latest tips and tricks to stay looking fresh. Why wait for the latest issue of Allure or Vogue when you can log online and find the exact products, tools, and tutorials you need?</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Influencer marketing makes for great partnerships:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">Budding cosmetic companies can benefit tremendously from tag teaming the beauty world on the stiletto heels of lifestyle and beauty bloggers and influencers, such as Emily Schuman of Cupcakes and Cashmere who boasts a cool 260,000 Instagram followers. According to <a href=""http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/5-brands-on-instagram-that-succeed-with-influencer-marketing/"">Social Media Examiner</a>, she joined forces with Birchbox to promote several of their spring boxes. Birchbox is a new, monthly subscription box that sends beauty and lifestyle products to curious shoppers ... and with just five Instagram photos of their May box, Emily touched more than 550,000 consumers and generated over 18,000 likes. For a new business, that type of exposure can literally make or break your success and the cost may be as low as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">sending a few products to your influencer</a> of choice and letting her do her thing. By establishing reoccurring partnerships with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer marketing</a> queens and kings, your brand has a steady stream of reliable exposure directly to your target audience for a fraction of the cost of paid advertising. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> can help you identify and reach out to the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">right influencer</a>s to ensure the partnership is a mutually beneficial success, but the good news is ... your influencer will do most of the work.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Product launches:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">If you don't have the bandwidth to establish long lasting partnerships, or sending swag to bloggers on a regular basis doesn't fit your budget, consider using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer marketing</a> to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promote</a> a product launch. By sending products to influencers just before the official release, you can generate buzz around your launch before the product even hits shelves. For example, luxury cosmetic brand Peter Thomas Roth sent advanced samples of their new Rose Stem Cell Bio-Repair Gel Mask to Arielle Charnas of Something Navy, who posted about the mask the day of launch. Within 24-hours, the post had sold 502 masks and $17,565 revenue according to the <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-bloggers-20160809-snap-story.html"">LA Times.</a> As your brand prepares for launch, consider using influencer marketing to augment your other marketing initiatives and support a more successful splash within the market.</p>

5 social networking sites every service marketing provider needs,"<p class=""Body"">Retail always seems to be the center of conversation when talking about the power of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social marketing</a>. With the rise of i<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">nfluencer marketing</a>, product placement and promotion has taken on a life of its own, so we get it. Self-made celebrities are unboxing products, recommending hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales, and getting paid for honest reviews on social media. The average consumer has become the new advertising executive. What you may not realize is that your service-based business can also benefit from<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/""> social networking sites</a> -- you just might be focusing on the wrong ones.</p>
The top five social networking sites for service marketing brands focus on geography-driven platforms or sites that connect service providers to users. That isn't to say that you brand can't benefit from other forms of social media; but if you can only invest in a few, these are your best bets.
<p class=""Body""><strong>1. Yelp: </strong>The most important <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media platform</a> for service providers is Yelp. This user-driven review site has become the gold standard for happy customers to share their experiences about local businesses and an honest snapshot of how these business are delivering service. Although many of the reviews focus on restaurants and hospitality, service-based businesses are also heavily represented. Because Yelp allows users to search based on geographic proximity, linking your business to the site not only helps increase your reputation as past customers' post reviews, but helps new customers find you and identify your brand as a trusted, local partner.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>2. Google+:</strong> You might be surprised to see Google+ make the cut on any relevant list about social networking sites. Consumers are not using this platform for ... well ...anything. However, it does have its perks. When you create a Google+ account for your business and link it to your geography=verified search listing, you open up the ability for users to review you, quickly learn more about your business, and ultimately navigate to your site. If nothing else, Google still weights Plus accounts in their search algorithm and a little boost in search rankings never hurt anyone. Google is the biggest search engine in the world, so whether you love or hate the platform, your business can benefit from simply creating an account.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>3. Facebook:</strong> If Yelp and Google+ help customers find your brand and understand your business's unique value proposition, then Facebook gives you a chance to solidify your expertise and become and established voice in your industry by posting relevant content that is helpful and engaging. Because Facebook is still represents the largest active user base in the social network ecosystem, it is the first place we recommend building a presence. If you only have time to post on one social networking site, Facebook provides the best bang for your buck thanks to the site's new business rating and geo-based recommendation features.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>4. Angie's List: </strong>Although Angie's List, and similar review sites such as Thumbtack, don't always come to mind when thinking about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social networking</a>, service-specific review platforms are critical for service oriented businesses. Unlike Yelp, Angie's List specifically targets service-based businesses (but ranks lower because it simply isn't as popular). The Yellowpages are gone, but review sites are going strong. These sites increase your SEO ranking, provide transparency into your work, and help customers find you. In many ways, these sites help support your Google+ account by creating valid bank links to your business, which all work together to increase your local searchability and presence in Google Maps.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>5. Handy: </strong>Handy, and it's competitor Tackl, are a new entrant into the social networking realm. Unlike traditional social sites, these platforms allow users to book directly with service providers for household needs such as repairs, cleaning, and painting. Although every industry isn't represented in this model, it's important to realize that these types of platforms are allowing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">businesses to participate in the ever-growing sharing economy</a> in a way they previously could not. These sites are becoming more widespread and popular across industries and we predict it will be one of the biggest growing trends as digital natives search for and choose people and brands they do business with.</p>

How video links can transport your tourism marketing to the future,"<p class=""Body"">Did you know that 66% of U.S. Consumers watch travel videos when thinking about or planning at trip to inform their purchasing decisions, according to <a href=""http://tubularinsights.com/travel-videos-youtube/"">Tubular Insights</a>? And did you know that by 2019, Cisco predicts that over 90% of the internet bandwidth will be used by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">video media</a>? We're sensing a trend here. Video links don't need to be a standalone marketing asset showcasing your property, product, or tourism services: they can be a gateway to your future marketing strategy.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Getting the right content in front of the right people:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">Most marketers agree that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video content</a> is an emotionally compelling, highly engaging way to reach their target audience. The key to successfully using video links as part of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy</a> is getting the right content in front of the right people. A great example of a brand that has done this successfully is <a href=""http://tubularinsights.com/turkish-airlines-winning-video-marketing/."">Turkish Airlines.</a> Although they only have a few thousand YouTube followers, their videos get an average of 1.9 million views per video (compared to Delta's average of approximately 94,000 views per video). These statistics didn't happen by accident. In addition to crafting highly shareable, entertaining (yet educational) content, Turkish Airlines has used paid video to push its content in front of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">qualified audiences</a> that then began sharing their content and taking it viral. In this instance, Turkish Airlines balanced content, organic exposure, and paid advertising to create the perfect digital mix. By using new data modeling techniques, such as attribution marketing, you can predict the right balance for your brand to drive similar success.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>Video links round out your multi-channel marketing strategy:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">Video links</a> complement almost every marketing channel and can be used alongside traditional media such as television and radio, and new media such as social media and PPC campaigns. By using A/B testing to understand what content appeals to your audience, you can create videos that delight and inspire action. Then, simply plug and play that content into your spend based on your channel performance findings using attribution forecasting. Sounds simple, right? It is. If you are new to attribution modeling, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/blog/marketing-attribution-matters-business"">click here</a> to learn more about what this new tool is and how it can benefit your business. Well placed video links are especially valuable for tourism marketing because they capture the essence of your property or brand in a way that still photos (that have a reputation for being stagnant at worst and photoshopped at best) and copy (that tells rather than shows) cannot.</p>
<p class=""Body""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">BIGEYE can help you</a> understand which videos work best and where to place them to maximize exposure across all your marketing touch points. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services"">Click here</a> to learn more about our creative and attribution services and start preparing for 2019's video trends today ... because who doesn't want to be two years ahead of their competition?</p>",,4/23/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-2.jpg,video-links-transport-tourism-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Geofencing is here & will revolutionize real estate marketing,"<p class=""Body"">Geofencing for real estate, multi-family properties, commerical real estate and more is finally here. Whether you use beacons, GPS tracking, or self-identified geo-targeting (such as checking in on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">social media</a>) to create the ""fence,"" it's all just a fancy way of of saying that you're creating a set of digital triggers based on where your potential customers are located.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Imagine that your multi-family property is a local sponsor of concert series in the park near your building. As the property manager, you can set up a customized Snapchat filter for these events welcoming attendees and inviting them to stop by your sales center for a swag bag or drinks. The filter will only be shown to users within several hundred feet of your property and the event, making it a great way to organically generate foot traffic.</p>
Or, imagine a couple walking down the street near their favorite coffee shop. They are considering buying their first home together and want to browse listings near by. Their real estate agent has set up geo-fences around his listings so they get notifications when they are near by potential matches. The couple can browse properties based on their desired budget, amenities, and neighborhood at their leisure before setting up a formal walk through when they are ready. This frees up their time to browse when they are already in the area, and their realtors' time from constantly sending new listings. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">Emails</a> are out, push notifications are in.
<p class=""Body""><strong>Geofencing isn't as difficult to set up as you think:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">Geofencing is already being done (we know you've used a customized Snapchat filter already, don't lie). Whether you're a building owner, property manager, or real estate agent, you can leverage tools that use geo-based information to create geofencing for your business. To get started, you simply need to understand the technology, then take a walk in your local neighborhood or around your property and consider how geofencing might work for your brand. If you're having trouble brainstorming, we know a few <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">highly qualified creative minds</a> that would be happy to help. Hint: they'll also help you balance geofencing marketing against your other campaigns so you get the most bang for your buck. Ready-made platforms such as Trillow and Snapchat are a great place to start, but you may also consider a proprietary app or program that tackles something new. Either way, we'll help you identify the right tools and put a plan in place.</p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>The benefits of geofencing for real estate marketing:</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">Geofencing gives power to the consumer to find information organically when they are ready and interested in learning about your property or consuming your content. Today's real estate shoppers expect this level of transparency as more and more people are initiating home purchases and leases on their own, or with only minor support from their real estate agents. As an agent or property manager, this gives you the tools to empower your target audience and help the right tenants and buyers find you -- rather than using a lot of energy to find them.</p>
<p class=""Body"">Geofences help you create qualified leads by using geography and other qualifiers, such as socioeconomic demographics and preferences linked through self-identified data collection, that signal when a potential customer is viable and valuable. Instead of spending time and resources on unqualified leads, geofencing helps your business understand who you should target first and gives you the freedom to invest in them rather than the ""spray and pray"" marketing model that targets anyone nearby. As an added bonus, geofencing also allows buildings and communities to alert residents of amazing local events, or to share important notifies and updates about weather or nearby incidents.</p>
<p class=""Body"">The possibilities are endless....and while we prefer to advocate building bridges rather than walls in your actual community, these are one type of fences we can get behind. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Contact us today</a> and see how real estate geofencing might fit into your 2019 <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">marketing strategy</a>.</p>",,4/25/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-1.jpg,geofencing-real-estate-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
7 Ways to incorporate media buying into your business plan,"<p class=""Body"">One of the most common questions we get from small and medium-sized businesses is how to craft a media buying plan tailored to their services. There is an unnecessary air of mystery around the process that can make media buying feel inaccessible to the average business owner. We have an entire department dedicated to business services marketing that can either handle the process for you, or empower you to do it yourself. To get you started, here are 7 quick and easy ways to begin incorporating media buying into your existing business services marketing plan.</p>
<strong>1.Who are your personas and target audience: </strong><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">Media buying</a> for business services starts with<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/""> knowing your audience</a> and the personas most likely to need your services. Before you invest a single dollar in a media buying spend, get clear on who you are talking to and where they are listening. By knowing your audience, you can spend less money on your campaigns, but maximize their effectiveness because your placements will be answering questions and directly targeting the right people.

<strong>2. Focus on time- and location-based targeting: </strong>Once you know who your audience is, you need to understand <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">how to reach them</a>. This is especially true when marketing business services. Understand whether your customers are shopping during business hours for their own companies, or whether they are confusing research at home, after hours. If your ads aren't reaching them at the right time, they are going to waste. Tailor your media spend around the times and geographic areas that are most likely to yield results. The more you know about your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">target audience</a>, the more effective you can be. <b> </b>

<strong>3. Set clear, measurable primary goals:</strong> Realize what you are trying to accomplish. Are you looking for leads? Trials? Sales? <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">Brand awareness</a>? The list goes on. Understand how your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/media-training-services/"">media</a> buying fits into the marketing mix and what you hope to accomplish. We believe that if you can't measure it, you shouldn't do it -- and this is no exception. Establish clear, time-bound, and trackable performance indicators. We encourage all of our clients to set up omni-channel marketing strategies that work together seamlessly to accomplish different goals. If you're unsure how to do this, our services might be for you.

<strong>4. Understand your unpaid marketing potential:</strong> It might sound counterintuitive, but a good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">media buying strategy</a> starts with knowing what you <i>don't</i> need. Evaluate how your natural search results are performing and how your unpaid media on blogs and social media is impacting your brand, then only use paid media to fill in necessary gaps. Your media buying spend should work smarter, not harder for your dollar, which is why tracking everything is so important.

<strong>5. Understand how media fits into your creative, branding and content strategies:</strong> Anything you choose to invest in media buying should complement and support your work across other channels. A true omni-channel marketing strategy acknowledges that the customer journey doesn't happen in silos. Customers move across devices, between content types, and through the purchase cycle more seamlessly than ever, so each of your marketing efforts should mirror and support each other -- and ideally drive customers to other platforms to complete their journey.

<strong>6. Know the lingo:</strong> Take time to debunk any jargon, lingo, and marketing-speak surrounding your media buy. Even if you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">use an agency</a> to support your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">business services marketing plan</a>, it pays to understand what they are talking about. Knowing the difference between CPC and CPI can mean the difference in being over or under budget depending on how much money you have to spend. Never be afraid to ask questions. As a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services"">multi-platform agency</a>, we are here to support your business -- and that means helping you understand your marketing needs.

<strong>7. Programmatic and automated media buying:</strong> Last, but certainly not least, we encourage you explore programmatic or automated media buying opportunities. These emerging tools adapt your media spend to real-time data about your clients, campaigns and performance so you are spending just the right amount -- not a penny more, or less. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">Click here</a> to learn more about how these programs can support a more seamless and cost-efficient media buying experience.",,5/5/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/7-ways-to-incorporate-media-buying-into-your-business-services-marketing-plan.jpg,7-ways-to-incorporate-media-buying-into-your-business-services-marketing-plan,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Nursing home marketing & print ads go hand-in-hand,"<p class=""p1"">If we were to tell you that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print ads</a> go hand in hand with nursing home marketing, you might be tempted to reach for a joke about the slow decline of the print industry and aging clients' reticence to adopt new marketing technology. It's true that print ads do perfectly complement and support nursing home marketing ... but not for the reasons you might think.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Print ads deliver tangibility and credibility:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">When making an important and difficult decision, like where to spend your golden years, marketing bravado is the last thing you need to complicate the process. While print ads may not prove the presence of your expected level of service or desired facilities, there is something to be said for holding a tangible, high-quality brochure in your hands to validate a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">brand's image</a>. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">High-quality print marketing</a> materials suggest that the brand is willing to invest in its clients and has enough liquidity to produce expensive assets. Regardless of whether these assumptions are always true or not, print ads do lend an air of credibility to your marketing efforts by providing something potential clients can take home, hold, review, and consider. Marketing psychology has proved time and again that the weight and finish of paper used in marketing collateral can have a profound influence on the perception of a brand. Possibly for this reason, direct mail boasts a three-time better response rate than <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/email-marketing/"">email</a> according to the <a href=""https://cash4toners.com/info/2019/02/10/why-print-matters/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Harvard Business Review</a>. We'll take those odds.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Printed nursing home marketing materials appeal to young decision makers:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">It is also important to realize the decision makers choosing (and financing) nursing home contracts are not always the future residents themselves. As the Baby Boomers continue retiring and aging, their children will slowly shift from care-receivers to caretakers. More than 50% of Generation X and Y view magazine and newspaper <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print ads</a> in favorable light, compared to their staggeringly low 10 - 20% favorability toward digital PPC and banner ads, according to a study by <a href=""http://www.millwardbrown.com/adreaction/genxyz/global/gen-x-y-an"">Kantar Millard Brown</a>. To digital natives, a good website is an expectation -- a print ad or brochure goes above and beyond. For this group of decision makers, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital advertising</a> is simply an annoyance standing between them and the content they want; whereas well placed print assets can serve as true supporting and educational material.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Print ads drive action:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">So, what's the bottom line? In our hyper-digital world, we are sometimes shocked by the reality that few channels drive action better than direct mail print ads. Close to 80% of consumers will act on direct mail immediately according to the <a href=""http://www.cmocouncil.org/"">CMO Council</a>. Still in doubt? <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services/digital-marketing-agency/email-marketing/"">Email marketing</a> only delivers a 45% immediate action rate. Choosing a nursing home is a deeply personal and sometimes sensitive decision, so any channel than can inspire immediate action is beneficial to the customer and the service center itself.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Print ads still signal service, and with that, we can't think of a tool better suited to support nursing home marketing needs. When considering how to maximize your marketing spend as a care and service provider, always assess how and where print ads fit into your marketing mix. No matter what technology emerges, print will always have a place in the middle of the marketing funnel when consumers seek education and deep information about a brand.

Stop overlooking the forgotten Generation X with resort ads,"<p class=""p1"">With so much emphasis on Generation Y's blooming purchase power and the golden parachutes Baby Boomers are enjoying post-retirement, Generation X, otherwise known as the forgotten generation, is ... well, being forgotten yet again. But this is a huge mistake if you are a traveler marketer.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Generation X by the numbers:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">If getting people to your resort starts, at least in part, with the numbers game this should be enough to grab your attention. According to <a href=""http://www.shullman.net/services/the-pulse"">Shullman Research Center</a>, there are 60 million Generation X-ers in the United States -- or 25% of the adult population. It's true, that the Baby Boomers and Millennials still represent a larger subset of the population, but no savvy decision maker would advocate ignoring 25% of your potential audience. Perhaps more appealing: members of Generation X have more ideal purchase demographics than other generations. A healthy swath of Generation X has a household income of more than $250,000 (36% to be exact), and the remaining 64% still boast higher average household incomes than the majority of retired Baby Boomers and up-and-coming millennials. While these statistics might not always hold true, <i>now </i>is the time to market your resort to Generation X.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The majority of Generation X is likely to have a family, be established enough in their career to travel, with disposable income to burn. This is a recipe for success for resorts that can position themselves as a romantic getaway (sans children) or a family-friendly escape for the whole crew.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Resort advertising potential for Generation X:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">So, how do you appeal to a generation primed for travel but often overlooked in the hype around other generations? The answer might shock you: get your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/"">website</a> and online booking engine in gear. According to renowned <a href=""http://www.mmgyglobal.com"">MMGY</a> travel agency partner program, 82% of Generation X books their travel online, with 71% of them conducting research via online travel agency programs to craft their perfect vacation.</p>
<p class=""p3"">No generation is more primed for self-service travel booking than Generation X. Often self-identified as former latch-key children and hyper-independent consumers, they are reticent to trust mainstream media and untested hype about products or places. That means that your resort needs to have an authentic, credible website with up-to-date photos, testimonials, and clear information about your unique value proposition. You also won't survive without peer reviews and a strong social presence to validate the claims your marketing team is making.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Tips and tricks for appealing to Generation X:</strong></p>

The road less traveled: Internet radio ads & travel marketing,"<p class=""p1"">When <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">planning a digital marketing</a> spend for any travel destination, the top opportunities that immediately come to mind are probably traditional web tools such as your website, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">click-based advertising</a>, search engine marketing, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email campaigns</a>, and other traditional digital tools. What you might be missing, is the incredible promise of internet radio ads. Yes, we're serious.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Internet radio ads reach big audiences -- and we mean BIG:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Internet-Radios-Audience-Turns-Marketer-Heads/1009652"">eMarketer</a>, over 50% of the population listens to internet radio. And unlike television, which demands its audience's full attention, radio listeners can enjoy music for hours while doing other things, multi-tasking, and spending time with others. <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites"">Forbes</a> estimates that internet radio platforms such as Pandora, Spotify, Apple Music, and Sirius XM have boosted the total possible listening hours worldwide to 59.5 billion per day. The best part? The estimated cap on all that listening time is $2.6 billion of revenue <i>per day </i>in 2017. That is a lot of untapped potential.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Internet radio ads tend to be more difficult to skip or avoid than other forms of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">media advertising</a>, such as commercials, because listeners are less inclined to flip between radio stations while cooking dinner or in the midst of a conversation. Instead, they'll simply let the content stream until their music resumes, absorbing your advertisements along the way. Because internet radio is still a relatively new platform for advertising, there seems to be anecdotally less annoyance toward music ads than other forms of promotion because they are part of the normal listening experience and always have been. More importantly, internet radio ads have figured something out that commercial advertising has not: audiences don't mind seemingly customized, native-style advertisements.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Travel marketing primed for radio thanks to customized listening preferences:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">One of the reasons internet radio ads are still reasonably well received hinges on advertisers' eagerness to align their ads to music channels and types of music that fit their natural customer personas. It's no accident that you often hear ads for GoToMeeting virtual conferencing software on Sirius XM's CNN channel. The same applies for travel marketing. Hotel brands often release playlists or music channels on internet radio platforms such as Spotify to deepen visitors' brand loyalty. For example, The Standard, a luxury hotel brain with properties in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, promotes a notoriously famous collection of playlists on Spotify that captures the sounds and experiences guests can expect at each location. No matter where you find yourself listening, one of the Standard's playlists will instantly transport you back to their property ... or make you want to book your next trip.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Interestingly enough, Spotify cites audience location, social, and biometric data as a much better predictor of what someone will listen to than their past or self-proclaimed listening preferences. This same data is often used to tailor travel and tourism personas, making the combination of internet radio ads and international marketing a natural fit. Music is often one of the most personal expressions of who we are, so advertising your travel destination alongside artists, genres, or even music venues that fit your audience is a smart move. Learn more about how personas can influence your travel marketing strategy in our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=14865&amp;preview=true"">recent blog</a>, Why Persona Marketing Is the Key For Your Tourist Destination, explore <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/services"">our services</a> and sign up for a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz"">free consultation</a> about how internet ads can send people to your travel destination.</p>",,5/13/2017 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Internet-Radio-Ads-and-Travel-Marketing.jpg,internet-radio-ads-and-travel-marketing,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why persona marketing is the key for your tourist destination,"<p class=""p1"">Whether guests visit your destination to stay in rustic, canvas yurts under the stars, or pay premium prices to be wined and dined by celebrity chefs and sommeliers -- everyone is looking for something that fits their tastes, needs, and lifestyle. Persona marketing helps tourism and hospitality brands <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">define their target audiences</a> and set themselves apart from the competition by honing in on who really wants to visit their destinations. You don't need to please everyone ... you just have to please a select few.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Persona marketing unlocks destination discovery: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">There isn't a ""one size fits all"" vacation model. There isn't even an average standard for what vacations should look like. According to <a href=""http://www.ipsos.fr/sites/default/files/doc_associe/tripbarometer_ipsos_tripadvisor_dec2015.pdf"">TripBarometer</a>, only 34% of travelers in the United States fall into what is commonly defined as a ""traditional,"" or mainstream, travel category. The remaining 66% lean toward specialized travel subsets such as adventure or experiential travelers, solo, luxury, or service-oriented vacationers. As a marketer, you simply can't make broad assumptions about who your target audience may be. You need to get narrow on who is most likely to visit your tourist destination, how they prefer to plan vacations, who they travel with, how they spend, when they go, and what they like. Personas are a great, actionable way to achieve this.</p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">Persona marketing</a> helps brands break away from dangerous generalizations and gain clarity about the demographics of the people most likely to visit their destination. The first thing people often decide when booking a vacation experience is where they want to travel. For this reason, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">persona marketing</a> can be an especially effective means to promote your destination during this discovery period. For example, Costa Rica has become famous as a prime spot for eco-travelers and nature enthusiasts thanks to the country's many treehouse resorts, surfing lodges, yoga retreats, zip-line courses, and sustainable tourism efforts. Tourist destinations in Costa Rica can leverage their position within this ecosystem by appealing to the specific personas who find these elements attractive. Knowing - and speaking directly to - the marketing persona that fits this profile allows brands to tailor their efforts to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">websites</a>, journals, and blogs where viable prospects are already enjoying content. This reduces friction in the discovery process and reduces the amount of effort and time needed to secure a sale.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Tailored merchandising maximizes vacations and revenue:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Once you've attracted the attention of a potential persona and have a steady stream of visitors heading to your tourist destination, you can still use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">persona marketing</a> to tailor the vacation experience on a deeper level. Consider a cruise ship. Cruisers are, in and of themselves, a certain type of travel persona: often, families with disposable annual income of $150K or more who are educated and want to see the world, but don't want the hassle of planning the nuances of the trip themselves. Yet, within this persona, there are travelers who will naturally fall into a variety of sub-types: those who want to spend every day at the spa, those who want a steady-stream of kid-friendly activities, romantic couples, adventure seekers, water lovers, foodies, and bar flies. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">Knowing the personas</a> that are attracted to your tourist destination and the nuances of the sub-types within those personas allows you to tailor your merchandising efforts for effectively so you can send spa discounts, dining recommendations, entertainment promotions, and event reminders to the right people at the right times.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">persona marketing</a> helps you make everyone's vacation experience feel highly specialized and personal, which augments the tourist experience ... and, of course, increases the chances that guests will spend (more) money at your site. In the United States, the majority of travelers cite ""treating themselves"" as a top priority when traveling, according to the <a href=""https://www.trekksoft.com/en/blog/travel-tourism-stats-2016"">Trekksoft</a> travel blog. They look to sightseeing (53%), special dining (41%), accommodation (41%), activities (35%), and shopping (24%) respectively as the top areas to splurge. Knowing which of these items your guests are most interested in allows you to meet their needs and your bottom line.</p>

Apartment hunting just got easier: Listing your dream pad online,"<p class=""p1"">While real estate agents often provide a level of expertise, legal advice, and support, they also add a third-party, middle layer that many businesses and consumers want to avoid. As more and more people prefer to (and expect to) take a ""DIY approach"" to real estate, an influx of apartment listing and direct-to-consumer sites have flooded the market to satisfy this niche in the digital world. Most managed properties have been letting tenants do everything from paying their rent, to booking maintenance by themselves via the internet for several years, increasing the expectation that the leasing process itself should also follow suit. Getting ahead of this trend can help your property attract self-sufficient, proactive tenants and increase the perception that your brand is ahead of the apartment marketing curve.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Consumer apartment listing sites:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Consumer listing sites such as <a href=""http://rent.com""><span class=""s1"">rent.com</span></a>, <a href=""http://apartmentfinder.com""><span class=""s1"">apartmentfinder.com</span></a>, <a href=""http://forrent.com""><span class=""s1"">forrent.com</span></a>, and <a href=""http://apartments.com""><span class=""s1"">apartments.com</span></a> provide broad apartment marketing support for units that are agent-listed or self-managed. These websites leverage geolocation and filtering tools to help would-be tenants find properties that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">fit their lifestyle and needs</a>. The benefit of using these sites is that your property is highly searchable, and very little preference is given to one listing over another, creating an equal playing field. Advertising is tied directly to location and amenities rather than your search budget or website prowess. The flip side of those benefits is that your property personality will be absorbed by the listing site itself, making it somewhat harder to differentiate your building or unit from other options.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1"">Easy customer interface makes finding your property a breeze</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">List one property or many: sites are free or require nominal fees for advertisers on a budget</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Creates the appearance of a technology-first approach, even when property is still evolving</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Seamlessly supports other advertising channels so your apartment is searchable no matter how customers choose to find you</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1"">This new technology is still building credibility and trust across the real estate marketing world</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Limited by listing site's branding rather than your own</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Requires management and follow up to ensure leads evolve into tenants</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Proprietary apartment marketing sites:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">The benefit of individual property websites is that you have an opportunity to show off your unit's or building's unique personality, amenities, and neighborhood. More so than listing options, property-specific sites allow you to paint a picture of what it is like to actually live on-site. Take the North Carolina based <a href=""http://www.midtowngreenapartments.com"">Midtown Green Apartments</a>, for example. Their dedicated website provides deep insight into how a resident connects with the building and surrounding area. Potential tenants can review floor plans, interact with the neighborhood, browse a photo gallery of building amenities, and connect with the property management team itself. This is a wonderful tool once customers have found your property. Leveraging this tactic requires a strong search and discovery strategy to ensure potential tenants find the site. The best content in the world can't make an impact if no one surfs your site and finds it.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1"">Provides deep information about a building, with full-scale branding and immersive content</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Communicates look, feel, and vibe of desired residents to increase fit at point of sale</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Creates dedicated link to property staff and leasing opportunities</li>
 	<li class=""li1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">Builds a brand</a>, rather than a transaction</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Cons: </strong></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1"">May exclude rent-by-owner opportunities, favoring property managed buildings</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">Guests need a pre-existing relationship with the building or strong top of funnel support to ensure content is found</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1"">Both listing and dedicated sites provide unique, digital opportunities for owners and managers to promote their property.

How out of home advertising supports destination marketing,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let's start with the obvious question. What is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">out of home advertising</a> or OOH? OOH is a broad term, encompassing any type of advertising where<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/""> brands interact with potential customers</a> outside their homes. This includes billboards, point of sale displays, bus or street signage, and guerrilla or grassroots marketing events -- to name a few. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unlike many emerging digital trends, which focus on highly customized, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">targeted campaigns</a>, OOH marketing uses broad with mass appeal to attract large swaths of potential customers. Destination marketing efforts focused on communities or destinations are ideal candidates for this tactic because they may attract a variety of market segments and personalities.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Why OOH is great for destination marketing:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Imagine yourself living in New York in the dead of winter. There is a foot of slushy snow and an icy breeze biting at your heels as you enter the subway. You sit down, look up, and there are pictures of Florida's sunny shores beckoning from the subway walls. <a href=""http://companies.bizjournals.com/profile/st-petersburg-clearwater/705718/?mkt=newyork""><span class=""s2"">Visit St. Pete-Clearwater</span></a> has captured hearts and minds (and wallets) of New Yorkers for close to half a decade using this visceral, out of home strategy.</span><span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The ads are generic, with tag lines such as, ""Feel It,"" ""Craft It,"" ""Live It,"" ""Love It,"" allowing a wide variety of viewers to connect with the ad at once. Calls to action included website links, text message prompts, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a>, and even a sweepstakes opportunity. Potential travelers could interact with this destination marketing campaign in a variety of ways, ultimately leading to a booking. This is the quintessential picture of how and why OOH campaigns are ideal for destination marketing. When done correctly, they can reach a wide variety of customers by appealing to a shared emotion. In this example, it's a desire to get out of the cold New York snow. Regardless of your vacation style preferences, this universal need resonates.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Taking out of home marketing to the next level:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> </span><span class=""s1"">A key to keeping out of home advertising relevant is successfully connecting it to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">brand's digital ecosystem</a>. In addition to linking back to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/"">website</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">social media</a> accounts, consider taking advantage of digital signage or beacon-based marketing opportunities that give the illusion of a more personalized <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">OOH</a> experience. Today's digital signs can update and optimize content in real-time, giving marketers more nuanced control over their out of home experiences than ever before.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> </span><span class=""s1"">When linked with CRM data, social media, or other analytic triggers (such as weather conditions or traffic patterns), out of home marketing is also primed to become a critical direct response tool to encourage on-demand booking. Virtual payment options such as Apple Pay, PayPal, and payment via Twitter can all enable instant bookings as customers interact with your brand on the go. This eliminates one of the major hurdles of OOH marketing, which is the ""cooling period"" prospective customers experience between the time they see your out of home trigger and when they are able to research your destination and make booking decisions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> </span><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Let us help you</a> craft an out of home destination marketing campaign that will capture travelers' imagination and encourage them to explore your venue and engage with your omni-channel strategy for a unified and immersive marketing experience.

Why people live to eat (and are getting rewarded for it),"<p class=""p1"">Forget a 15% tip ... how about a 35% increase in restaurant guest visits? According to <a href=""https://possector.com/management/restaurant-loyalty-programs"">Loyalogy</a>, top loyalty cards and program provider, that's the expected uplift many restaurants enjoy when they introduce loyalty programs to their marketing mix. Discounts, point systems, loyalty cards, keychains, apps, social media offers, and memberships are just a few of the many ways restaurant marketing programs can leverage reward systems to drive business and boost foot traffic. To get you started, here are a few simple guidelines.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Simply ask: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">After guests complete their meal, present them with a quick survey asking how their experience was and what types of rewards would motivate them to return on a regular basis. Keep it simple and straightforward so your guests are not annoyed with the survey experience. If you have difficulty getting customers to answer your survey, try incentivizing them with a discount or free dessert. You can guess at what motivates your customers, but it is faster, easier, and more accurate to simply ask. As an added bonus, you'll also receive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">some operational insight</a> that will help you improve your quality of service and overall restaurant experience.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Frequency rewards: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Frequency rewards, such as loyalty cards, are one of the most common ways to encourage guests to come back. Everyone from major hotels such as Starwood, to dining sites such as OpenTable - and, of course, restaurants - are using loyalty programs to keep guests coming back. The benefit of frequency rewards is that you are driving more visits that will offset any type of reward you choose to give. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">simple break-even analysis</a> will help you understand how many visits you need to accrue before a reward has paid for itself and brought you greater than expected revenue.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Lead with value:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Another option is to lead with value. Membership to restaurants and social clubs, such as the SoHo House brand, incentivizes visitors to come back by providing exclusive access to special menu items, spaces, or experiences. Whether members pay a fee to join or must meet a threshold of purchases to remain connected, your business will benefit. The key is understanding what extra value you can provide to members that they cannot get anywhere else. Cooking classes with a celebrity chef, members' wine tasting events, or on-site performances are a few of the ways you might augment your traditional dining experience. Ideally, any exclusive experiences you offer would not incur additional or exorbitant fees to the day-to-day operations of the business, so consider what relationships or in-kind exchanges you can leverage to keep costs low.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Partner with existing programs: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Lastly, one of the easiest ways to build your rewards program is to partner with an organization that already has a membership or loyalty base. A raw juice bar may benefit from partnering with a nearby gym, for example. Consider what local partners naturally align with your restaurant and evaluate what they are doing to drive visits. By giving another organization access to your customer base, you can cross-market for each other and generate business that will benefit both brands. In addition to encouraging repeat visits, partnerships also give your brand exposure to customers that may not have discovered you otherwise.</p>

TV ads aren't just a thing of the past? Personal care ads are back,"<p class=""p2"">While TV ads aren't suitable for every product, you need to look no further than brands such as Proactive, the Magic Bullet, or George Foreman to understand how longer advertising segments - also known as direct response television (DRTV) - can educate and engage audiences.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Reframing personal case advertising as education:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Trademark DRTV tools such as customer testimonials, before and after footage, and tutorials all educate your customers rather than strictly selling to them. We know that customers crave this type of content based on the deluge of YouTube tutorials and channels dedicated to trying, showcasing, and testing personal care products. And long format TV ads were the original platform for beauty ""vloggers,"" so why stop now?</p>
<p class=""p2"">Longer TV ads are valuable when building <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">awareness about your products</a> and helping potential customers understand something new. For personal care advertising, this is especially important because you are asking customers to switch brands or interrupt their current personal care routine. According to a recent <a href=""http://blog.kissmetrics.com/increasing-customer-ltv-and-loyalty/"">Nielsen report</a>, price and quality are two of the biggest factors that influence a consumer to switch brands. In both cases, DRTV can more thoroughly educate your audience and demonstrate value or pricing than shorter media options.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Getting the best band for your beauty buck:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Infomercials are also a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">great place to test market</a> segments and messaging. Because long format ads run after major programming dies down, the cost of this media is, well, cheap. But that doesn't make it invaluable. A traditional 30-second television slot during primetime can cost an average of five million dollars, depending on the channel; so if you're going to advertise during peak hours, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">messaging better be on point</a>. Infomercials allow you to test audience response and gauge the effectiveness of your content without blowing your budget. Once something works, you can take it to primetime.</p>
<p class=""p2"">But don't assume that the ""graveyard shift"" can't give you a real return on investment from any testing you do run. The <a href=""http://theweek.com/articles/454561/lucrative-secret-behind-infomercials"">US market for infomercials</a> is slated to exceed $250 billion, making it more valuable than network cable, coming in at only $97 billion. Direct response television has a surprisingly large audience, covering a wide genre of viewers, age brackets, and demographics. It's okay: we'll admit we secretly watch late night TV ads if you (and the rest of the country) do.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If your goal is to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/work"">build a brand</a>, understand your audience, and refine your marketing mix, DRTV might be a good option to supplement your other advertising outlets. In many cases, you can use DRTV ads to send potential customers to your website and social media accounts, expanding your sphere of influence and customer engagement.

The power of voice through artificial intelligence,"<strong>Siri - what is Artificial Intelligence?</strong>

What was once a figment of imagination is now changing the way society thinks and conveys information. According to <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/05/08/alexa-cortana-google-home-virtual-assistants/101422926/?csp=tech"">USA Today</a>, more than one-quarter of smartphone owners in the U.S., 60.5 million Americans, will use a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">virtual assistant</a> like Alexa, Apple’s Siri, or Microsoft’s Cortana at least once a month. There are several voice assistants on the market including big names like Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Echo, and Google Home - and they are smarter than ever before. They engage machine learning algorithms making it easier to react and respond in real time. By understanding speech patterns and recording data, virtual assistants are capable of correcting spelling corrections to display the correct results. With the very premise to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">learn from data, analyze it</a>, and craft algorithms, AI technology is becoming better at understanding behavior, making predictions, and finding answers.

<strong>Siri - how are marketers going to tap into AI?</strong>

AI is presenting an opportunity for marketers to utilize behavior - driving an increase in productivity and changing the way we do business. These advancements result in no longer having twenty options to choose from before finding what you need, rather one or two. It is changing the way we process information, excepting your answer almost instantly. This all has to do with the specific nature of voice search and the optimization of search sites. With this change in consumer behavior, it is important to understand the difference between typed searches and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice searches</a> and how they influence a business. AI is also not only increasing organizational efficiency but dramatically reducing the chance of a mistake by detecting patterns like spam or fraud. While news, apps, and games are quickly switching to the world of voice; marketing budgets remain rather small, creating a cheap and easy way to compile research on the everyday consumer.

<strong>Siri - how will it affect SEO?</strong>

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-14988"" src=""https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/voice-search-wont-change-in-seo1.png"" alt="""" width=""421"" height=""215"" />

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> is always changing and what used to be optional is slowly becoming a necessity, especially when you're on a smartphone. AI does not mean the end of SEO, but rather a new way of comprehending user intent. Due to voice search becoming so popular, businesses need to make sure they are claimed and optimized to accurately appear when searched. It is essential to know exactly what users are looking for to properly optimize a site. By using lengthier sentences when talking instead of typing content incorporates more words. Adding full sentences to your keywords can even help create a person-centered approach. For example, instead of typing ""weather NYC"", it is more likely for someone to say ""what's the weather like in New York City"" when speaking aloud. It is smart to start brainstorming about what questions may be asked about your business, product, or service to understand what naturally spoken searches may occur. By <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">optimizing a campaign</a> and finding new ways to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">reach your audience</a>, AI is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">making websites</a> more friendly and user accessible.

As consumers change the ways they search for information, marketers have to make sure to focus on a more natural approach. If they want their products and services found through voice queries, it is essential to focus on improving your SEO by tailoring it to contain keywords and phrases from a natural “who, what, when and how” communication level. This doesn't mean you need to change your site content or entire SEO strategy, but it does mean it’s time for some changes to make AI beneficial. Voice search is creating a tremendous shift in how marketers approach their CPC as well as triggering faster answers in the SERPs. Adding in natural language on your site will help achieve the success with voice search results that you're looking for. When considering the intent behind a voice search and the consumer’s end-goal, brainstorm questions that could be asked in relation to the business. As voice recognition becomes more accurate, the capabilities will continue to expand.

<strong>Siri - how will society evolve?</strong>

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-14990"" src=""https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Siri-voice-activated-assistant-technology-on-an-Apple-iPhone.jpg"" alt="""" width=""233"" height=""155"" />

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Virtual assistants</a> are now becoming a part of everyday life - making it easier to turn a light on, locate the nearest carwash, or find a recipe. A perfect example is Google Home, creating an assistant reflecting a consumers needs. Think about Alexa, bringing voice to the everyday consumer by actually living in their home.  A benefit of using voice search is that it’s hands-free. Not having to use your hands allows people to multi-task whether you're asking for directions, making a phone call, or trying to find the best Chinese in your area. Voice search makes it simpler by removing the number of actions a person has to make and creates a more time-effective solution for an on-the-go situation. Faster answers lead to faster actions, creating an ideal way to communicate more efficiently. These changes are providing more ways to create opportunities for exposure and connect with customers better.

Understanding the top trends within influencer marketing,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Influencer marketing isn’t new - in fact, almost 70% of brands already use this tool according to the annual <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomward/2017/02/13/5-influencer-marketing-trends-that-will-dominate-2017/#5d690776293a"">Influencer Marketing Report</a><b> </b>hosted by Forbes. What’s changed is how people use it. Using the internet to enhance our lives has become almost second nature. Five or ten years ago, tagging a mobile GPS to remember your parking spot, outsourcing your love life to a deluge of dating apps, or crowdsourcing where you want to eat dinner on Friday night simply wasn’t the norm — but today it is. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Video rules the influencer sphere: </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Although Instagram is often cited as the most popular social media platform for influencers and celebrities,<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/web-video-production-agency/""> video</a> is the most popular medium to get the word out. In a world where SnapChat, Instagram, Facebook (and many others) offer disappearing videos and live-streaming options, static imagery can feel too permanent or too official. Or worse — be confused with a paid ad. Disposable and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/live-streaming-production-company/"">live videos</a> offer snack-sized vignettes rather than full-scale productions, yielding an opportunity to showcase glimmers of authenticity in an otherwise highly curated and Photoshopped social landscape. There are only but so many filters you can apply to an on-the-go Instagram story. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For example, former contestants of the multi-million dollar <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/how-bachelor-contestants-cash-in-after-the-show-is-over.html"">Bachelor and Bachelorette reality television franchise</a> have long been criticized for selling themselves out as brand influencers, posting photo after photo of tagged, brand content across their social media accounts. While these would-be celebs are, indeed, influential, the negative attention around their brand partnerships undermines their credibility and effectiveness. Where a posed photo and brand copy rings false and may invite a deluge of derogatory comments, a quick, candid video of these influencers can feel less contrived and subconsciously encourage more adoption and less scrutiny. It doesn’t hurt that Instagram and SnapChat stories don’t always allow comments that would otherwise lead more receptive viewers. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Bottom line: more video, less photo. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Don’t forget your micro-influencers: </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s great if you have A-list celebrity connections (or a budget that will make it look like you do), but micro-influencers can be just as effective and, in some cases, more effective than big-name campaigns. Consider the near cult following of popular, local athletic trainers or the sway of regional political and sports figures. For location-based or niche marketing efforts, these endorsements are sometimes more effective than national and global figures because the influencers appear to be more authentic, relatable, and genuine. Even after your brand reaches a national scope, there is no reason not to include micro-influencers to target special interest groups and regions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Here’s an example. In 2013, just outside Raleigh, North Carolina, a suburban housewife and her husband created a holiday <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kjoUjOHjPI"">video </a>of their family singing in their pajamas. The video parodied the song “Welcome to Miami” by Will Smith as the couple danced around with their kids in matching holiday attire singing about their “Xmas Jammies.” What started as a fun family prank turned into a regional phenomenon with more than 17 million views on this one video alone. The Holderness family now has their own <a href=""http://theholdernessfamily.com/"">website</a>, YouTube channel and millions of followers who eagerly await their parenting tips, product recommendations, and – of course – musical parodies. While they may not be red carpet royalty, this family wields tremendous influence over the young-parenting crew in North Carolina. Local clothing brands and child-friendly products clamor for their attention and a quick product nod because what the Holderness family says, goes. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Bottom line: Sometimes you really do need to think local, not global.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Avoid freebie freeloaders:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The word is out. Influencer marketing is working. But as the popularity of this medium has grown, so has the new wave of aspiring tastemakers entering the blogosphere in hopes of receiving free swag, comped trips, and insider perks. This is great news if you are just starting your influencer marketing program and need to people willing to endorse your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand.</a> Budding bloggers don’t follow the pay-to-play model celebrities live by. While Kylie Jenner can charge upwards of $100,000 per Instagram post, emerging internet personalities will often try or promote brands for free in exchange for access to your products and a turn riding your company’s coattails. This can often be a mutually beneficial relationship, but it’s important to choose where you invest your time, money, products, and energy with care so you don’t get taken advantage of.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You want those individuals chatting about your products to mirror your brand values and have a big enough following to matter (otherwise you’re just sending people free products). To avoid giving too much away, create a budget that will help you evaluate just how much you’re willing to invest in influencers and what you hope to get in return. Map measurable KPIs against these figures (such as how many people are viewing your influencers’ blog post, how many likes did you get, is there a way to collect leads, etc.) and doggedly enforce your return on investment.</span></p>

Google’s new fact checking feature is filtering the internet,"Would you be surprised to learn that approximately 23% of information and news on the internet is fake according to <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org"">Pew Research Center.</a> Maybe not, considering recent publicity about “fake news” during the 2016 presidential election. Facebook and Google received so much negative attention for perpetuating false stories about the candidates that they have begun taking measures to validate and regulate information circulating the internet. Today, both sources offer disclaimers about information or news that appears to be fictitious. Whether debunking the urban legend that solo-travelers often wake up in a bathtub full of ice with a missing kidney, or that <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/fake-presidential-election-news-viral-facebook-trump-clinton-2016-11/%233-pope-francis-endorses-trump-for-president-9"">Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump</a>, the internet is cracking down on rumors.

<strong>What is Google Fact Check?: </strong>

Google’s new fact checking feature is the first search engine attempt to filter content on the internet. We want to use the word “filter” with caution because Google is not <i>restricting</i> information (which would be illegal). Instead, the search engine is <i>prioritizing</i> validated sources in their ranked search results and providing “fact snippets” when possible citing verified information as the first search result. The trick is that these <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/04/10/google-fact-check-snopes-politifact-factcheck/100263464/"">results</a> (and their effectiveness) depend largely on the search terms used when posing a query. For example, USA conducted a test assessing the myth that former President Barack Obama was not an American citizen. The results were a true SEO catch-22.

When USA Today journalists searched for “Obama Kenyan citizen” the search engine yielded a validated Snopes.com dissent, with a Google-endorsed myth-buster as the first search result. However, when searching for “Obama birth certificate fake,” no Google fact snippet is available. In instances where Google has not yet validated a query, the highest-ranking SEO results appear … which happens to be a fake article supporting the birther movement. This is to say that Google’s fact checker is only as good as the SEO search terms and tagging in place today.

If the search terms match a query that has been validated by Google, users will see where the question originated, where the answer has been validated by third parties, and whether it is true or false. Google isn’t fact-checking queries itself, simply leaning on third-party or non-partisan sources to highlight the best results. Unfortunately, it’s up to brands to fill in gaps where Google verification does not yet exist or where there is not a perfect search match. That’s where you come in.

<strong>Why This Matters for Your Brand?: </strong>

As Google’s fact checking capabilities expand, it will continue to rely on SEO to determine the best, most accurate, and most valid results, resources, and websites. Your brand needs to meet and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/online-survey-company/"">exceed baseline search</a> engine requirements to stay relevant and rank appropriately in this brave new world. While your products may not be taking a stand on political myths, the veracity and relevance of your content will play into the larger search ecosystem and how you stack up when people search for what the best brand in your industry is today.

If it feels like the pressure is on to clean up your SEO strategy to ensure your site’s continued relevancy, you’re probably right. But don’t worry.<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com""> Our team</a> of search specialists can help audit your site to determine if the appropriate search terms are appearing in your content and at the right frequency.

Our most valuable customer service is: Brand naming,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You have an amazing idea for a new app, you just got your first prototype back on a product design, you’re excited to hit the market and your customers are ready… ah, the excitement of a startup. There is an almost tangible, electric buzz in the air when a brand is ready to launch. And there are a million decisions to make between when you hatch an idea and when it hits the streets. The most important decision a business can make is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand naming.</a></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the excitement of a launch, naming can either become an afterthought with too little <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">strategy</a> too late, or a gridlock of decision paralysis. That’s why it sometimes helps to call in a third-party point of view that can guide you through this process. Here are just a few of the things <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">we</a> encourage our clients to think about when it’s </span><span class=""s1"">time to name their products and brand.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Do Your Homework:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As soon as you think you have a name that works, do a little <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">research</a>. When you put it into Google, what are the first search queries that populate? Are there social media hashtags, handles, or personalities associated with or similar to your proposed product name? What corresponding URLs exist? Your goal isn’t simply to ensure your brand name is free, but to evaluate any preexisting associations with words related to your budding business. As an example, in 2014 the frozen pizza company DiGiorno used the hashtag #WhyIStayed (presumably the pizza) in a product campaign. Only later did the organization find out that #WhyIStayed was hashtag often used by domestic abuse victims to share their stories. What was meant to be a lighthearted new product plug quickly became a public relations nightmare. Do your best to understand the ways in which your brand and product names can be interpreted before committing. You’ll thank yourself later.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Tell Your Story:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We are rolling our eyes just thinking about the number of startups that use obscure names and nonsensical words in their product and brand names. While this can be an effective way to infuse your company with a little mystery and marketing mystique (honestly, what does a fruit like a blackberry have anything to do with smart phones?), it isn’t a safe bet. You risk customers forgetting or misinterpreting your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand name</a>, or seeming too obscure to matter. Your name is your customers’ first impression of you and should tell part of your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story</a>. When “ShoeSite” was founded in 1999, the owners knew they would need to come up with a better brand name to capture what they were selling – shoes. Can you guess what ShoeSite settled on? Zappos. Zappos plays off the Spanish word for shoes, zapatos, offering a playful way to explain what they do, while differentiating the brand from the competition. The brand name is straightforward, creative, but helps tell the Zappos story. In other words, it’s perfect. It sounds simple, until you try to do it yourself.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Consistency is Key:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">No matter what you choose as your brand name, it should serve a keystone for all future releases and iterations. Whether you are versioning products, or releasing something entirely new, use your brand name as inspiration and an anchor for future decisions. For example, the Swedish furniture company IKEA has over 9,500 products, all of which have Scandanavian-inspired names paying tribute to the company’s roots (all the way in suburban America). While the Kivik, Karlstad, Klippan, and Vimle collections may not necessarily tell consumers what those brands look like, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">underlying brand values</a> of streamlined Nordic simplicity and price value echo within these categories. The company’s values are reinforced with each product iteration that adheres to these naming principles. Just think how out of place Restoration Hardware’s product categories would sound knowing their emphasis is on artisan craftsmanship and materials: Gramercy Metal, Weathered Oak, Printmakers Collection, to name a few. No matter how small these details may seem, your customers will subconsciously absorb them.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let us work with your brand to craft the perfect naming strategy or refine the brand and product structure you have today. Like we said – no detail is too small for your customers.

How to get a five-star app rating and five-digit downloads,"<strong>1. Four Quarters vs. Ten Dime </strong>

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we would rather have four quarters than ten dimes. In other words,<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/""> seek out <em>quality</em> app users</a> — even if that means your adoption and download rate will be slower at first — because happy users leave positive reviews, share your content, and become unofficial brand ambassadors for your app. And the higher your app rating, the better your App Store ranking will be. Quality downloads, rather than quantity, are the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">fundamental building block of long-term app success</a>. That means, if you’re tempted to purchase downloads on one of the many get-followers-fast websites or spam your entire email distribution list with app updates: stop right now and reread this paragraph.

<strong>2. Think Like Goldilocks</strong>

To get your app in front of quality users, you need to focus your optimization efforts. The key is that your search terms can’t be too broad (or you risk competing with too many other apps), and they can’t be too narrow (or you risk putting yourself in such a small niche that no one will find you) ... they need to be juuuust right. Like Goldilocks. Partner with an agency to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">build a solid keyword strategy</a>, then tag and place your terms three to five times anywhere and everywhere that is appropriate. This is true for search engine optimization around your app, YouTube content showcasing your app, your App Store description, and submission details. The clearer you are on who your audience is and why they might search for and use your app, the more successful these efforts will be.

<strong>3. Start With a Whisper (Launch)</strong>

If you have a new app, consider rolling out your platform with a whisper launch to quietly introduce curated users (think: family, friends, VIP customers, and select demographics) to your app to get early and actionable feedback, build ratings, and establish credibility before you start <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mass-promoting your app</a>. If you go live with a big splash and immediately get a string of poor ratings and unhappy users, your app will be dead in the water before it has the chance to hit double digit downloads. By starting with a whisper launch, you can tweak bugs and unexpected behavior before it reaches the broader public. This can also serve as a unique way to engage desirable customer segments and make them feel special by giving them the opportunity to engage in an exclusive partnership with your brand and provide feedback before anyone else.

<strong>4. Fast Follow with a Bang </strong>

Once you’re confident that your app is ready for mass distribution, consider a Cost Per Install (CPI) burst campaign to quickly drive traffic to your app. The sudden influx of installations will help boost your ranking in Google Play and the Apple App Store, which will create a self-renewing stream of new users. The average app user does not scroll beyond the first 10-20 app results, and almost no one scrolls beyond the first 50, so your goal should be to incrementally and continuously increase rank within your keyword category (which is why those keywords really are so important). You can supplement these efforts with retargeting ad campaigns that announce your app to existing customers to increase effectiveness and reach.

<strong>5. Say it With a Video</strong>

Your customers don’t know what they don’t know. If you are launching a new app, the best way to encourage downloads and adoption is to make sure your customers understand what that app can do for them and why it’s valuable. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">Video</a> is one of the easiest and most effective ways to do this. Create a YouTube video <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">showcasing your app’s best features</a> and functionality, then promote it across your website, social media channels, and via <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email</a>. This is an inexpensive way to promote your app and can result in thousands of views and potential downloads if optimized and distributed appropriately. Leverage your agency partner to nail your video content and outreach strategy for maximum results.

Cross-channel attribution is one trend you can't afford to miss,"<p class=""p1"">The celebrated Forrester Research institute unequivocally states that “traditional one-to-one, last-touch methods of allocating demand to marketing efforts are outdated and lead to a suboptimal marketing mix. Customer Intelligence (CI) professionals must adopt a cross-channel attribution model in order to optimize marketing budgets, accurately calculate customer value and acquisition costs, and develop a holistic view of the marketing ecosystem.” They aren’t mincing words there. But don’t worry. We feel your pain.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We’ve heard all the objections before: cross-channel attribution is too complicated, there isn’t enough data across platforms, and it’s simply more work than it’s worth. ... Which is why we’re here to debunk those myths and help you realize that cross-channel attribution is easier (and more valuable) than you ever imagined. If you read our blogs, you know we believe in cross channel-marketing, so it shouldn’t surprise you that we are a champion for cross-channel attribution.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Customers expect a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">highly personalized marketing</a> experience, and we can’t give that to them if we don’t understand how and why they invest time in certain platforms or content types. Your accounting department probably wouldn’t be too thrilled to find out you were using an inaccurate, outdated methodology to calculate your ROI and forecast your budget for next year either. Here are a few objections we often hear from our clients when faced with this reality ... and how we have helped them overcome their challenges.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Objection: “Last-touch attribution is good enough...” </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Last-touch attribution, or giving sales credit to the last platform a customer engaged with prior to purchase, may seem like the path of least resistance, but it simply isn’t accurate. For budding <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">analytics teams</a>, last-touch attribution is a quick way to start collecting directional data without needing too many tags or complicated methodology. Unfortunately, many touch points get excluded or underweighted because they don’t always represent the point of sale, even though they play a critical part of your customer journey. Last-touch is certainly better than nothing and will get your team started, but often misses the bigger picture (your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email team</a> will probably agree, since they are almost always a first or early customer touch point). We often tell clients who are just beginning their journey to a more accurate attribution model to start small. Let us help you roadmap your path to cross-channel attribution by setting milestones that will slowly and thoughtfully expand on your last-touch model. By adding one data point at a time, your team can fine-tune the accuracy and usefulness of each piece of new information before expanding your program.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Objection: “Cross-channel attribution isn’t accurate because offline data doesn’t exist...” </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">The notion that we can’t track or stitch together customer behavior both on- and offline may have once been true, but that’s no longer the case. Seasonality, competitor presence in market, event marketing, word of mouth, and hundreds of other offline variables are — yes — more difficult to track, but can be evaluated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">through the use of digital tools</a>. For example, we recommend assigning a special hashtag, social media filter, or promotion to an in-store event or offline campaign to help you gauge the success of the many channels working together to make that experience a success. As offline data improves through the use of GPS signals, beacons, and AR breakthroughs, this pain point will continue to fade away. By ensuring your other channels are accurately tracking and that you are prepared to enhance offline data, you’ll be ahead of the curve and competition.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Objection: “We already use programmatic advertising software and don’t need additional tracking...” </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Don’t mistake the ease and efficiency of programmatic bidding and ad placement with understanding which channels are pulling the most weight. PA software is a great tool that uses data from a variety of sources to optimize your ad placements and spend, but it doesn’t tell you enough about your overall channel performance to make informed decisions about the types of content or campaigns you want to beef up on — it simply makes the most of what you’ve got. Cross-channel attribution should affirm that your digital ads are doing their fair share of work, but will also reveal where guests aren’t spending time and provide insight into how you can improve your holistic strategy. Depending on how robust your data is, we often suggest businesses start with building a flawless analytics program and then adding programmatic advertising because good customer insights will elevate all your campaigns — even automated ones. Let us help you find a balance between your programs to maximize success.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Objection: “It won’t really change how we go to market...”</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">The more you <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">know about your customers</a>, the more you can anticipate their needs. Knowing that your most valuable customers often respond to email promotions, but purchase in-app; or that your Instagram account is driving people to your best YouTube tutorials; or that most people browse your content on their mobile devices, but purchase in store are all revealing and actionable pieces of information. And if you don’t use them...someone else will. Customer expectations are exponentially increasing, so understanding how, where, and when they like to shop allows you to create a flawless shopping and service experience that invites five-star reviews, referrals, repeat purchases, and deep satisfaction. We tell all our clients that you should never collect data if you don’t intend to use it. If the touch points you’re collecting don’t correlate to customer action, we recommend you reassess the data you’re collecting. If you aren’t sure what KPIs to use, or how to find actionable customer insights, we can help.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Click <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">here</a> to explore how businesses like you have used this methodology and see how we can support your transition from outdated attribution models to high-performing, cross-channel tracking. And remember, you don’t need to take our word for it — Forrester agrees.</p>",,10/20/2017 15:26,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_578813467.jpg,cross-channel-attribution,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Programmatic Advertising 101: Why nerdy trends are profitable,"<strong><span class=""s7"">What is Programmatic Advertising (PA)</span><span class=""s7"">:</span></strong>

<span class=""s8"">Programmatic advertising tools use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">complex analysis</a>, forecasting, and regression algorithms to crunch millions of data points to find trends within certain customer groups. Once trends or behavioral patterns have been identified, the tool serves and optimizes content to your ideal audience in real time. As new data continues to be logged, your programmatic advertising spend will adjust accordingly so your advertising dollars are always being spent in the most efficient and effective way possible. Demand software using programmatic advertising input can bid on and serve everything from display advertisements, to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media</a> ads, to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">videos</a>, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeting campaigns</a>. We’ll give that an A+ for mathematics application. </span>

<strong><span class=""s9"">So, What’s in This for My Customers</span><span class=""s9"">?:</span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">Because <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">PA platforms</a> can track customer behavior, demographics, cross-channel activities, interests, and trends, you are only serving content that is of real interest to your ideal customer base. Programmatic advertising can also optimize content placement based on day, time, geography, and seasonality so your campaigns will reach your audience when they want or need it. That’s right, we said your ads could be both specific </span><span class=""s10"">and</span><span class=""s4""> timely. Trust us -</span><span class=""s4""> your customers will thank you later when they are clicking on your content rather than closing it out.  </span>

<strong><span class=""s9"">And, What’s in This for Me</span><span class=""s9"">?:</span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">It might go without saying</span><span class=""s4""> but: the harder your ads work for you — </span><span class=""s4"">i.e. </span><span class=""s4"">the more efficient and relevant they are to your customers — the more likely it is they will yield sales. A strong PA program also frees up your team to focus on other initiatives, such as generating killer content or building other areas of your cross-channel marketing strategy. Instead of wasting time haggling over bulk ad buys, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">trying to analyze</a> your display placement mix, or negotiating with media vendors, PA software does this for you. </span>

<strong><span class=""s9"">Getting Started: </span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">Programmatic advertising isn’t just for “big corporations.” If the IDC’s adoption rate tells you anything, it’s that PA is a universal tool that can benefit any industry, any type of business, and any size operation. With that said, setting up a program that’s tailored to your needs can feel a little daunting if you don’t have an established <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">analytics team</a>. In fact, unless you already have a</span><span class=""s4"">n in-house</span><span class=""s4""> team who ha</span><span class=""s4"">s</span><span class=""s4""> worked with programmatic advertising in the past, the quickest path to success is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">partnering with an agency </a></span><span class=""s4"">who</span><span class=""s4""> can get you started. Setting up your PA parameters is the hard part — the software will take care of the rest. To make this easy, your agency will </span><span class=""s4"">help you define a budget and cross check your content to ensure your first ad bids, and subsequent optimization efforts, are successful and ready to scale for success. When you’re just starting, you will set clear, measurable goals and work with your agency </span><span class=""s4"">to </span><span class=""s4"">understand the expected return on investment of a certain bid so you know exactly what you’re getting. Even though PA alleviates a lot of planning pain for your team, it’s important to track and optimize everything ... including your optimization efforts. We’re here to help. </span>

What is OpenAP and how it can help you reach your target market,"<span class=""s4"">For several years, we’ve been reticent to encourage clients to invest big bucks in television ads because the audience sim</span><span class=""s4"">ply isn’t narrow enough to make the return on investment </span><span class=""s4"">— which is often quite low after you factor in production overhead and distribution costs — worth</span><span class=""s4"">while</span><span class=""s4"">. While television was once a premium medium for advertisers thanks to high levels of viewer eng</span><span class=""s4"">agement, we have seen a sharp decline in effectiveness because viewers can easily tune out commercials when content isn’t relevant to them by turning their attention to their mobile phones, tablets, or laptops. For the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketer</a>, this was an opportu</span><span class=""s4"">nity to prove why relevant and timely content is so important ... and cash in along the way. For media distributors, it was nearly a death sentence. </span>

<span class=""s4"">The good news is that many major television companies have been aware of this issue and actively seeking </span><span class=""s4"">ways to revitalize one of the most hallowed marketing channels in history. This spring, Viacom, Fox Networks Group, and Time Warner Cable finally came up with a viable solution. Instead of banking on the few big-ticket commercial opportunities </span><span class=""s4"">to keep the</span><span class=""s4"">ir coffers afloat (think: multi-million dollar placements during the Super Bowl), they have banned together to help small- and medium-sized businesses affordably <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">reach their target audience</a>. </span>

<span class=""s4"">Together, they launched, “</span><span class=""s4"">OpenAP</span><span class=""s4"">” -</span> <span class=""s4"">a new data platform</span><span class=""s4""> that aggregates information from a variety of providers so advertisers can securely and collaboratively place ads within desirable demographics. Think: first-time </span><span class=""s4"">home buyers</span><span class=""s4"">, urban couples, pet owners, and more. Executive Vice President of Data Strategy </span><span class=""s4"">for Viacom, Bryson Gordon explained the vision to </span><a href=""https://www.mediavillage.com/article/openap-tv-advertising-made-simple/""><span class=""s5"">Media Village</span></a><span class=""s4""> in a recent interview: “I</span><span class=""s4"">t’</span><span class=""s4"">s about the secure sharing of those consistent audience segments across publis</span><span class=""s4"">hers. </span><span class=""s4""> </span><span class=""s4"">The advertiser or the agency will be able decide who can see the segment and how it gets shared with the publisher before activating it across their inventory. </span><span class=""s4""> </span><span class=""s4"">It also gives the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">individual networks</a> the independence to use their own proprietary data</span><span class=""s4"">sets in conjunction with industry accepted measurement services, such as Nielsen and </span><span class=""s4"">comScore</span><span class=""s4"">.” </span>

<span class=""s4"">His vision is important for two main reasons. </span>

<span class=""s4"">First and foremost, it makes television advertising relevant again. For example, CNN historically runs adverti</span><span class=""s4"">sements focused on Baby Boomers because this generation comprises the majority of their viewership. Young professionals watching the news while getting ready for work yawn through advertisements for retirement planning, bladder control medication, and 55+ residential</span><span class=""s4""> communities. The network’s blanket approach </span><span class=""s4"">to advertising makes it easy for one of the most valuable, growing sources of disposable income in the market to simply tune out. </span><span class=""s4"">OpenAP</span><span class=""s4""> makes it possible to tailor these ads so Baby Boomers still enjoy</span><span class=""s4""> rel</span><span class=""s4"">evant content, without alienating new or emerging demographics. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">Targeted content for targeted segments</a> finally makes television advertising relevant for the individual, not the majority. </span>

<span class=""s4"">Second, because networks can merge their own data with shared data </span><span class=""s4"">and link to other measurement tools, television ads will be measurable in a new and important way. Because advertisers previously had to rely on the “spray and pray” model when exposing content on television, it was hard to quantify how effective an advert</span><span class=""s4"">isement really was because only a fraction of viewers might actually represent qualified leads. By limiting exposure and tracking performance,</span><span class=""s4""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/""> planning and measurement</a> will naturally improve. </span>

<span class=""s4"">This is one of the first exciting breakthroughs the television </span><span class=""s4"">ad space has seen in years, and it </span><span class=""s4"">perfectly complements our belief that the future of customer-centric marketing hinges on a robust and </span><span class=""s4"">choiceful</span><span class=""s4""> cross-channel marketing approach. We’re excited</span><span class=""s4""> to see TV getting back in the game and are here to help you c</span><span class=""s4"">raft your first segmented, </span><span class=""s4"">trackable</span><span class=""s4""> television ad. </span><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz""><span class=""s5"">Get in touch</span></a><span class=""s4""> with</span><a name=""_GoBack""></a><span class=""s4""> our media and strategy teams to learn more!</span>",,11/6/2017 12:08,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_347179202.jpg,what-is-openap-and-how-it-can-help-you-reach-your-target-market,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
The real reason we start celebrating Christmas in July,"<strong><span class=""s6"">Craft</span><span class=""s6""> Creative Cross Channel </span><span class=""s6"">Campaign</span><span class=""s6"">s</span><span class=""s6"">: </span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">Every year, Bergdorf Goodman creates elaborate holiday window scenes in their flagship New York</span><span class=""s4""> City store. These themed displays are a highly</span><span class=""s4""> anticipated holiday tradition that shoppers consistently </span><span class=""s4"">look forward to every season. To build excitement, Bergdorf begins prev</span><span class=""s4"">iewing their displays months in advance with </span><span class=""s4"">Instagram</span><span class=""s4""> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f29WT_CSCiw""><span class=""s5"">YouTube</span></a><span class=""s4""> “</span><span class=""s4"">teasers</span><span class=""s4"">.</span><span class=""s4"">” This is a perfect example of a </span><span class=""s4"">cross-channel campaign that drives interest both on- and offline. When crafting a cross-ch</span><span class=""s4"">annel campaign, use </span><span class=""s4"">hashtags</span><span class=""s4"">, promotions, or sales previews – like Bergdorf – to roll out information slowly and to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">encourage potential customers</a> to engage socially before ultimately ending up in-store or on your website, where a sale is most likely to occ</span><span class=""s4"">ur.</span>

<strong><span class=""s6"">Don’</span><span class=""s6"">t Underestimate the Power of Public Relations: </span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">If there is one time of year when you should consider engaging with local journalists and publicists, it’s the holidays. Gift guides and feel-good holiday features are an opportunity for your company</span><span class=""s4""> to showcase your products or values within the community. If your company is committed to giving back or </span><span class=""s4"">championing sustainability standards, the holidays are a good time to expose those ideals. Local and regional journalists are often open to these </span><span class=""s4"">types of stories, so don’t be afraid to reach out and pitch an idea. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Your marketing agency partner</a> can also leverage any media contacts they might have to facilitate placement and fit. Similarly, gift guides</span><span class=""s4""> such as the outlandish (but highly celebrated) </span><span class=""s4"">Neiman Marcus “</span><a href=""http://neimanmarcus.tritium.co/neiman-marcus-christmas-book-2016""><span class=""s5"">Gift </span><span class=""s5"">Book</span></a><span class=""s4"">” (</span><span class=""s4"">and its </span><a href=""http://fortune.com/2016/10/19/neiman-marcus-christmas-book-gifts-2016/""><span class=""s5"">parodies</span></a><span class=""s4"">)</span><span class=""s4""> offer easy, lighthearted ways to gain exposure</span><span class=""s4"">. </span>

<strong><span class=""s6"">Give it Away: </span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">This is the season to give and receive, so give something away!</span><span class=""s4""> Contests are a great way to encourage potential customers to share your content. In fact, Facebook data indicates that more than 63% of their user base will share a link or tag </span><span class=""s4"">a friend in hopes of winning a promotional giveaway. Because people are often looking for gift ideas during this time, they are especially likely to engage with this type of content. Giveaways don’t need to be huge expenditures for your business. The key i</span><span class=""s4"">s ensuring that </span><span class=""s4"">whatever you’re offering – whether it costs $5 or $500 – is of value to your customer base. This is especially easy if you work in a service industry and can offer a trial, sneak preview, or private variation of your product. </span>

<strong><span class=""s6"">Nail the Big Sale</span><span class=""s6""> Dates: </span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">If you’re in retail, you should know when all the major sale dates occur. Here’s this year’s lineup: Black Friday on November 24, Small Business Saturday on November 25, Cyber Monday on November 27, Green Monday on December 11, and Free Shipping D</span><span class=""s4"">ay on December 15. You </span><span class=""s4"">should expect to offer both online and in-store promotions for each and every one of these days (even for those specifically geared toward one channel or the other) because your customers are expecting to </span><span class=""s7"">shop.</span><span class=""s4""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/""> Participation in these sale</a> dates is</span><span class=""s4""> the rule, not the exception,</span><span class=""s4""> whether you’re a big business or a small mom-and-</span><span class=""s4"">pop shop … so </span><span class=""s4"">be</span><span class=""s4""> prepared. Your e-</span><span class=""s4"">commerce platform should be ready for traffic, your ads and retargeting campaigns should be scheduled, your</span><span class=""s4""> social outreach should be polished, and your team should be ready to put all hands on deck. Use an agency partner to make sure all your bases are covered and you are appropriately staffed for extra action. </span>

<strong><span class=""s6"">It’</span><span class=""s6"">s Not Over </span><span class=""s6"">Until</span> <span class=""s6"">It</span><span class=""s6"">’s Over: </span></strong>

<span class=""s4"">One of the most</span><span class=""s4""> popular times to shop is directly </span><span class=""s7"">after</span><span class=""s4""> the holidays. People are returning gifts, cashing in gift certificates, and purchasing the items that didn’t get checked off their wish lists. This is an especially great time to launch an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing promotion </a></span><span class=""s4"">or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeting campaign</a> highlighting popular items that may have gone out of stock, or items that were abandoned in your customers’ shopping carts. Use your digital data to determine exactly what you should promote or discount to enjoy maximum benefit.

Why marketing to generation Z isn’t as easy as you think,"<p class=""p1"">Most of us might struggle to remember a time before smartphones and tablets controlled everything from our fitness routines and navigation systems, to our budgets and day-to-day communication...but we can still remember. Generation Z, on the other hand, won’t. Generation Z, the age cohort directly following Millennials who were born after 1992, is the first wave of true digital natives. They’re growing up with iPads at the dinner table and Facebook profiles before they are even born. As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">digital marketers</a>, this may seem like a golden opportunity to attract potential customers before they are even consumers; but getting this generation’s attention might be a lot more difficult than you think. Here’s why.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While the “always on” mindset has made it easier to communicate, learn, and share information, it has also had some unintended effects. The more information we have, the more our minds need to filter out. Many studies have shown that the constant barrage of information, and subsequent choices that go with it, reduce our collective happiness. In Malcolm Gladwell’s famous book on decision making, Blink, he suggests that unlimited options lead us to doubt decisions we’ve made by trading the gut feeling or rationale we originally used for a barrage of “what if’s” and “might have been’s.” Other studies show similar results when patients are faced with too many medical treatment options when investors are faced with too many stock options, when consumers are faced with too many selections at the grocery store, and when eligible suitors are faced with too many dating prospects online. Quite literally, digital natives are spoiled by choice.</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Our brains seek to correct this cognitive dissonance by filtering out information faster. Attention spans have become shorter and decision-making has become truncated by the constant mental jump between clicking, reading, watching, sharing, and acting on the information in front of us. As </span>Pulitzer Prize runner-up, <span class=""s1"">Nicholas Carr</span> puts it, “the redirection of our mental resources, from reading words to making judgments, may be imperceptible – our brains are quick – but it’s been shown to impede comprehension and retention, particularly when repeated.” Members of Generation Z likely do not even need to think about the filtering process as they switch between devices or channels, and flawlessly overlook or absorb certain information — but it is changing how they learn and make decisions.</p>
<p class=""p3"">By filtering out larger quantities of information faster, this generation is losing a degree of depth when engaging online.<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/""> Content that wins this generation’s attention</a> is pithy, memorable, and short ... not nuanced, detailed, and thorough. While this isn’t inherently “good” or “bad,” it does present a unique challenge for digital marketers. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">Video clips</a>, snack-sized content, and catchy taglines that are easy to remember and share are replacing the white pages, case studies, and product catalogs that older generations know and love.</p>
<p class=""p3"">With that in mind, it’s no surprise that one of the best ways to reach Generation Z is through YouTube. According to a recent <span class=""s1"">AdWeek study</span>, more than 95% of Gen Z said they can’t live without YouTube. Of those, nearly 80% said they have a favorable attitude toward celebrity endorsements. In other words, they are looking for someone to tell them which products or experiences to spend their time and money on. In a world with nearly unlimited <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">research potential</a>, sometimes it’s nice to just let someone tell you what the right answer is. And YouTube does that in a very compelling, digestible, and entertaining way. <span class=""s1"">In a similar study by Business Insider, Generation Z ranked YouTube reviews, product demos, and unboxing videos as some of their favorite forms of content, suggesting this insight is especially relevant within the consumer space. </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">YouTube is one of the most powerful tools for digital marketers when trying to break through the information clutter. To guide your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">YourTube content strategy</a>, we recommend asking whether your videos pass the “M.I.S.S.” test. Are they: Memorable? Informative? Short? And shareable? These four principles will help craft content that Generation Z will engage with and enjoy. That isn’t to say that your video content shouldn’t also be accurate and insightful. While Gen Z’s attention span may be shorter than previous generations, that doesn’t imply that they don’t have the intellectual breadth or depth to synthesize complex ideas. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Because Gen Z has grown up with floods of information, they are more adept at scanning for accuracy than previous generations. Fluffy jargon and obtuse information won’t get past these consumers. Use this knowledge as a challenge to distill the most critical information about your products and brand in a transparent, crisp vision of what your organization is all about.</p>

"How mobile marketing ""micro-moments"" can increase sales and ROI","<p class=""p1"">One of Google’s most valuable assets is its data, of course, which is why we carefully adhere to their best practices about “micro-moments” anytime we help our clients build a new<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/""> mobile marketing strategy</a>. As Google describes, “micro-moments occur when people reflexively turn to a device — more often than not a smartphone — to act on a need to learn something, do something, discover something, watch something, or buy something.” Unlike desktop behavior, which is more intentional simply due to the physical process of sitting down in front of a computer, mobile behavior occurs almost subconsciously as the user searches for information and attempts to solve a problem.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Google breaks down these micro-moments into four main categories, described as follows:</p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1"">I-want-to-know moments: e.g., “When is the next episode of Scandal airing?”</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">I-want-to-go moments: e.g., “What’s the closest gas station to my office?”</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">I-want-to-do moments: e.g., “How do I make a dirty martini?”</li>
 	<li class=""li1"">I-want-to-buy moments: e.g., “What are Nike’s newest sneakers for fall?”</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">Successful brands</a> distinctly market to these four scenarios and clearly differentiate between their mobile strategy and desktop strategy. An I-want-to-go query on a smartphone should almost always yield directions, a map application, and geo-based information before brand and destination-based content. On the other hand, a desktop query might be better satisfied with information about the specific destination or location in question.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For example, a mobile search for Disney Land might represent a desire to go to the park immediately as the searcher queues up directions; whereas a desktop search might represent a desire to plan a trip in the future. Both instances provide marketers with an opportunity to better serve their customers. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">Mobile users</a> might enjoy an on-site discount for a beverage package, whereas desktop shoppers might prefer hotel promotions. Understanding the most common use cases for each micro-moment on both mobile and desktop platforms allows you to create and serve more relevant and desirable content to your customers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And as the prevalence of smartphone usage increases, leveraging a clear <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">mobile strategy</a> can have a profound impact on sales and ROI. A recent Dscout study on Business Insider suggests that the average person touches his or her smartphone more than 2,000 times per day and logs over 145 minutes on their mobile device. That’s a lot of time to grab your customers’ attention and far more than the average person spends in front of a computer. When you factor in high open rates for SMS marketing at 98%, and mobile emails at 22% according to Marketo, it’s easy to understand why mobile is fastest growing digital marketing space.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To ensure your mobile strategy is working on your behalf, we recommend focusing on two guiding principles:</p>
<p class=""p1""><b>1. Translate urgency into actionability: </b></p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">Mobile search</a> queries usually represent an immediate desire to accomplish something. Capitalize on potential customers’ desire to complete a task by ensuring your SEO results, mobile presence, and ads are all actionable. Make sure your call-to-action buttons are clear and easily accessible, consider discounts specific to mobile shoppers, and bid on ad terms that correlate to actionable micro-moments related to your brand.</p>
<p class=""p1""><b>2. Champion clarity and condensed information: </b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Because mobile phones are simply smaller than desktops, your images, content, and text all need to work for smaller screens. Simply throwing your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website</a> onto a bootstrap template and hoping the responsive information hierarchy will work is no longer adequate in today’s mobile-first world. Consider a custom site or native app that appropriately translates your best content into small gems of information that can be consumed on the fly. <b> </b></p>

Use topic framing for guaranteed corporate video success,"<p class=""p1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">Video</a> is one of the most popular and important tools for brands in the market today ... yet one of the biggest concerns we hear from our clients is that their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">videos aren’t successful</a>: people aren’t watching or sharing them, or they are closing the video before the main messaging is complete. Usually, this is less of a reflection on the quality of the video, and more of a reflection on the relevance of the contentConsumers expect a highly personalized marketing experience, so one-size-fits-all corporate videos simply won’t cut it anymore. To guide your video strategy, we recommend using “topic framing” to ensure you are creating videos with a clear focus and subsequently sharing them with the right audience. Topic framing starts the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">creative process</a> by asking what you hope to accomplish or who you’re talking to, rather than with your brand and products. This allows you to make better decisions about how much to spend on video production or what types of content are most appropriate for that situation and audience. We’ve mapped out four of the most common frames to get you started.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Greeting Newbies (Also Known As Lead Generation): </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">If your goal is to attract customers who aren’t familiar with your brand, it’s time to pull out all the stops. Lead acquisition videos should clearly communicate the lifestyle and values associated with your products. We recommend splurging on high-quality production and carefully building a story that explains the main benefits of your brand. These types of videos are best supported by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">cross-channel marketing</a> materials that invite potential customers to watch your video after seeing enticing social, print, or ad content that teases some of your main benefits. Every brand should have at least one <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/live-streaming-production-company/"">lead generation video</a> in various lengths, so if this is your first corporate video — start here.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Establishing Thought Leadership and Networking: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">More mature brands or service-based companies might benefit from content that highlights your thought leadership and established presence within the industry. Recordings of recent lectures or conferences and direct one-on-one interaction with the camera from leaders within your organization signal that your brand is still learning, growing, and innovating. Unlike lead acquisition videos, you can get away with a more low-tech approach because the goal is to simply demonstrate knowledge and transparency. Thought leadership videos are a great way to differentiate your company from the competition or build excitement about an upcoming launch or event.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Playing to the Crowd: Fan-Focused: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Never underestimate the power of pleasing your best customers and fans. Videos that thank your customers, showcase their experiences with your products, entertain them, or delight them are good ways to build brand loyalty, encourage past customers to refer friends and family, and build goodwill. You can even leverage customer footage by inviting fans to submit videos on social media. Depending on your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">product or brand image</a>, the type of production value you need to deliver to make these videos a success will differ. Work with an agency to define what success looks like and what you hope to accomplish from a fan video so you don’t invest too much time and energy into something that may not benefit your organization.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>How-To Videos: </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Some of the most important videos are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">how-to videos</a> and product demonstrations that help prospective customers understand what they can do with your products, app, or services. This is especially important if you are a new entrant into the market or have a complicated app or product idea. Education, or lack thereof, is one of the first barriers that potential customers cite when opting out of a purchase, so we highly recommend you use tutorial videos to help them overcome these detrimental knowledge gaps. Make sure these videos are short, entertaining, and informative, or risk losing your audience before you even get started.</p>

Ed & Lorraine: America's demonic duo & Hollywood's inspiration,"<strong>Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren: America’s Demonic Duo
</strong>By: <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> Posted on October 31, 2017<strong>
</strong>

<em>Join us on an infographic journey as we trace Ed and Lorraine Warren’s career of facing fear and supernatural danger full force, in the well-documented cases of The Perron Family and the possessed Raggedy-Ann Doll, Annabelle.</em>

A couple devoted to revoking dangerous spirits back to the other side and protecting the living from the sinister forces of evil.

Join us on a journey as we trace Ed and Lorraine Warren’s career of facing fear and supernatural danger full of force, in the well-documented cases of The Perron Family and the possessed Raggedy-Ann Doll Annabelle.

According to the church, only demonologists are allowed to perform exorcisms.

Ed and Lorraine Warren are two of the most prominent demonologists of all time.

&nbsp;

<strong>Lorraine Warren, Demonologist: </strong>

“The spirit doesn’t see me as a woman or you as a man. The spirit sees the aura, and like attracts like.”okay

Clairvoyant, psychic and light trance medium

Over 10,000 cases of demonology

Most trusted artifact: The Holy Rosary

&nbsp;

<strong>Ed Warren, Demonologist: </strong>

“I learned about demons as a child and proved they exist as a man beyond a shadow of a doubt. Religions are man-made, but spirituality isn’t.”

Grew up in a haunted house

Born in Bridgeport, CT

Ordained exorcist by the church

Most trusted artifact: The Holy Bible

&nbsp;

Nothing could have prepared Ed and Lorraine for the spirits that haunted the Perron family’s farmhouse and the case of Annabelle the Doll.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Part One: The Bathsheba Hauntings</strong></em>

Eight generations of hauntings and killings over the years.

Bathsheba: The first owner of The Old Arnold Estate in Harrisville, Rhode Island who would later haunt and threaten the Perron family. According to rumor, Bathsheba Sherman was rumored to have sacrificed her newborn child to the devil.

Upon purchasing the farmhouse, right before the realtor handed the keys to the Perron family, she warned them to “leave the lights ON at night.” Yes, the Perron family knew of the hauntings, but couldn’t handle Bathsheba much longer before calling on Ed and Lorraine for their help. During their stay, Mrs. Carolyn Perron became possessed by the spirit of Bathsheba. Ed and Lorraine tried to help, but in the end only made matters worse for the family by angering Bathsheba. The Perron stories were later referenced in the Hollywood blockbuster movie, The Conjuring.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Part Two: The Annabelle Hauntings</strong></em>

Annabelle Higgins: A possessed Raggedy-Ann doll given as an innocent gift to a nursing student, Donna, but would later become an object of evil and violence.

Legend says the spirit of a 7-year-old little girl named Annabelle, who was murdered in the location where Donna’s new apartment was built, latched on to the doll. A priest told Donna that Annabelle was an innocent spirit; however, he didn’t realize how benevolent she would become. Annabelle tortured Donna and her friends with notes, mysterious blood stains, and even with physical harm.

Out of desperation, Lorraine and Ed were called in. They took the doll back to their home and locked it in a glass box.

A museum visitor opened the glass box and challenged Annabelle to do her worst...He died the next day in a car accident.

Why voice technology is important for your business,"Today, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice-based assistants</a> such as Siri and Cortana are used to fulfill basic office tasks such as document retrieval, typing and transcription. Saving even a few seconds during such common tasks can lead to significant productivity gains when taken to scale.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why voice technology is right for your business</strong>

One needs only look at the quickly escalating adoption of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a> -- and the laserlike focus on the development of such technology by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, to understand the paradigm shift that's underway. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/content-marketing-agency/"">Research firm</a> Gartner has estimated<a href=""https://www.gartner.com/doc/3021226/market-trends-voice-ui-consumer""><u> that 30-percent </u></a>of our technology interactions will be voice-based by the end of 2018. As the technology matures and grows more powerful, we can expect this number to grow dramatically, as businesses and consumers seek to take advantage of the ease of use and efficiency offered by voice interactions. At some point in the not distant future,<a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/voice-recognition-technology-is-expediting-the-race-to-frictionless-retail/""><u> the frictionless nature of voice technology </u></a>makes it destined to become the default means of tech communication -- and this will transform the business landscape.

While voice may be the dominant form of technology interfacing in the near future, today it largely serves as a key supplementary technology. When deployed in appropriate areas and used within current technological limits, it can help reduce inefficiency, improve the customer experience and help businesses earn a decided competitive advantage.

Partnering with a third-party <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-interaction-design-services/""><u>application developer</u></a> is of the best ways for businesses to ensure that voice technology is leveraged to its full potential. These providers can develop industry-specific solutions that make voice technology more effective while improving the customer experience. By helping companies take full advantage of Amazon skill development and assisting with the formulation of a strategy for the deployment of voice technology, these providers serve as a trusted gateway into this exciting new business realm.

&nbsp;

<strong>Examples of voice technology deployed in a business setting</strong>

Getting the most out of voice interactions demands a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">two-prong strategy</a>. First, businesses need to play to the strength of voice assistants, they are remarkably good at what they do, yet it should still be understood that these are first-generation devices. Ensuring your dialogue with Alexa or Google Assistant has the requisite context clues and conversational relevance, for example, can make the process much more efficient.

Second, businesses will benefit from developing tailored use cases where voice technology can be effectively applied. Today, this goes well beyond simple tasks such as email dictation. Today, voice technology is used in myriad ways. For example, the <a href=""https://mw17.mwconf.org/paper/a-case-study-on-using-voice-technology-to-assist-the-museum-visitor/""><u>Museum of Modern Art used </u></a>voice technology to help visitors navigate their building by deploying Amazon Echos throughout the facility.

Visitors could ask Alexa about hours, restroom locations and even the theme or intent behind specific works of art. Voice technology is also deployed on a daily basis in more routine corporate settings, filling key tasks such as making warehouse operations more efficient by helping workers locate inventory.

&nbsp;

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a> continues to mature -- and businesses grow more creative with applications -- we can expect it to grow from a key supplementary technology to a core part of business operations. Enterprises staying at the vanguard of new developments in this area are likely to reap profound competitive advantages.

The value of visitor stitching,"Harvesting data from visitors to your website has long been one of the most effective ways to understand your audience. It's also an invaluable tool for calibrating your content to increase its relevance to your audience, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">creating personalized marketing messages</a> that can be delivered in a more targeted fashion.

Yet because this is an evolving technology, gaps have remained that have limited the efficacy of data-rich insights. One of the most notable of these roadblocks is the ""multiple device problem."" This describes a situation where a single user visits a website using multiple devices -- for example, a phone, laptop, work computer, tablet etc.

Because this traffic originates from a variety of sources, it presents a problem in terms of compiling a data-enhanced profile of site visitors. In other words, if you can't recognize these disparate sources of traffic as coming from a single person, you can't build an accurate and comprehensive user profile -- you'll have multiple profiles that only show part of the overall picture.

<strong>Why visitor stitching is the solution</strong>

Resolution of this problem requires that all <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">devices connected to an individual user</a> be integrated into a single, comprehensive profile. While conventional <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">data analytics express</a> multi-device traffic as coming from three different people on three separate visits, there is a technique that resolves this problem: Visitor stitching.

Visitor stitching eliminates the need to manually integrate multi-device traffic (a time-consuming and expensive task) by providing an elegant real-time mapping solution. The technology works like this: Identifiers belonging to an individual (such as email addresses or social media user names) are recognized and then mapped in real time to multiple devices. This creates a new, comprehensive user profile that incorporates all of the data being held in separate, non-integrated user profiles.

Now, instead of a distinct profile being generated for each user every time a new device is used, a single profile contains all the user data generated across every device.

<strong>Why visitor stitching offers a critical competitive edge</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">Data analysis</a> is the key to understanding who your customers are and what motivates them. Fully leveraging data also offers a serious competitive edge, as personalized marketing and targeted offers lead to more conversions and greater consumer loyalty. <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/what-shoppers-really-want-from-personalized-marketing"">Data from McKinsey </a>shows that personalized approaches can generate revenue gains of 10 to 30-percent while creating enduring loyalty.

Visitor stitching plays a key role in helping you take full advantage of the power of data. Without the ability to track users across multiple devices, you're only seeing part of the picture. By creating a comprehensive profile that integrates all visitor data across every device through the process of visitor stitching, you can understand consumers on a deeper level and quickly anticipate their needs.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

If you're not getting the most out of your data analysis efforts, visitor stitching can play an essential role in helping you better <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/qualitative-research-services/"">understand your consumers</a>. Once you have a clear-eyed grasp on who your audience is and what motivates them, you can deliver highly-relevant, personalized marketing that wins converts and creates more revenue.

Why the next billboard you see may be watching you,"They don't represent the most dynamic form of advertising, of course, but they've always had two things in their favor: Major visibility and a broad, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">captive audience</a> receptive to any new stimuli.

Soon, however, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">modern billboards</a> may be unrecognizable to our great-grandparents' generation. Technology has given them an interactive upgrade, allowing them to deliver a more customized, personal experience.

<strong>The new age of billboard advertising</strong>

Static billboards have a problem -- they simply aren't relevant to a large number of people who view them. Advertisers have historically tackled this problem in a variety of ways; they placed billboards in strategic locations where they believed consumer interest was higher, and they also created billboards capable of rotating through multiple ads.

Truly interactive billboards were the next step in this evolution. McDonald's, for example, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u0ij9D5S4Y""><u>created a massive interactive billboard </u></a>that allowed by passers to use their smartphones to play ping-pong on the face of the billboard. Another well-known example of the form was the <u><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiKlNhtwpOA"">Times Square ""Dunk Tank"" interactive billboard</a>,</u> which allowed people to dunk live models by batting a ball projected on the screen. Or, consider the case of the interactive Coca-Cola billboard that used facial recognition technology to watch and mimic the expressions and emotions of pedestrians.

<strong>Why this approach is good for marketers and consumers</strong>

It's no secret that personalized approaches are more effective in marketing contexts. In terms of attribution, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">interactive billboards</a> play a key role in moving consumers toward a desired outcome. Interactive billboards interrupt the normal flow of daily life in outdoor environments; people are jolted out of their typical routine by the appearance of the unexpected.

Ultimately, this deepens engagement with the marketing message to an extraordinary degree. Most billboards are simply part of the landscape; we don't even make a conscious decision to ignore them. Interactive billboards break this pattern. If they are cleverly designed, they prompt an unexpected burst of delight.

This, in turn, creates a memorable experience -- and in the realm of marketing, few things are more valuable.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Thanks to interactive technology, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">billboards</a> are no longer dull, static and easily ignored parts of the landscape. Companies that use interactive billboard technology effectively can reap significant benefits in the form of deeper engagement with audiences.

Tips to develop an effective content marketing strategy,"Smart <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> helps businesses grow revenue, deepen engagement and expand audiences.

Why does a well-executed content <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing plan</a> have such a positive effect? Because it touches on virtually all aspects of your marketing efforts. It boosts your search ranking, increases the value of your online offerings and provides you with the material you need to grow your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media footprint</a>. All of this results in more traffic and conversions, as your audience will appreciate useful, high-value content tailored to their interests. After all, there's a reason why the majority of businesses report putting <a href=""http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2017_B2B_Research_FINAL.pdf"">more resources toward content creation </a>year after year.

So how does one design an effective content marketing strategy? Let's review a few key tips:

<strong>Articulate your goals</strong>

No strategy can be effectively implemented without a blueprint, so defining your near and long-term goals should be the first step you take. Ask yourself the following: “What do I want my content marketing plan to achieve?” “Am I looking for more sales?” “More traffic and leads?” “Positioning as an authority in my industry?” Once the broad contours are drawn, you'll be in a good position to start implementing your vision.

<strong>Develop a buyer persona</strong>

Knowing your audience is fundamental to good marketing. You simply can't create and deliver highly-targeted, deeply relevant content with a scattershot approach. One of the best ways to ensure you're using resources wisely is the <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research"">creation of a buyer persona</a> (a generalized and fictionalized profile of your ideal customer). These personas should be informed by hard data (demographic information you've collected via various channels/market data you have access to etc.) and your subjective impressions of your clients and your niche.

<strong>Do your research</strong>

Are your competitors investing in their own content marketing plan? If so, audit what they are doing and see if it's driving engagement. There are a variety of software tools you can use to gauge the performance of your competitors' content, in terms of likes, shares, traffic, etc. You'll want to use these same tools (Google Analytics, Yoast, etc.) when evaluating the performance of your own new content.

<strong>Focus on quality</strong>

When your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/""> strategy is firmly in place</a>, you've done the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">research</a>, and you've decided which <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content management</a> system best suits your needs, it's time to focus on content creation. Here, it's essential that you offer your audience something of value. Invest in high-quality, authoritative writing. Make sure your content is optimized for search and social. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">Mobile and video</a> offerings continue to grow in importance; by at least one metric, video will be responsible for <a href=""https://forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/02/03/video-marketing-the-future-of-content-marketing/#2acd79e02bf7"">80-percent of all online traffic</a> by 2019, while mobile video consumption grows at a staggering 100-percent year over year.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">Content marketing</a> is a powerful tool that helps businesses grow their audiences, boost revenue and increase brand awareness. Follow the tips outlined above when creating your content marketing plan.

How to develop a global marketing strategy and brand campaign,"To help you lay the groundwork for marketing success, let's discuss the basics of running a global <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">brand campaign</a>, and the pitfalls you'll need to sidestep.

<strong>Global marketing strategies 101</strong>

If you're a smaller business, the idea of a global marketing campaign may seem a bit ambitious. Yet the truth is that traditional barriers to entry have reduced dramatically -- or in some cases, have outright collapsed. Thanks to the rise of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital economy</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">social media</a>, Big Data, cloud computing, and modern technological tools, an effective global campaign is within the reach of most enterprises.

When designing a new campaign, the first thing to understand is that ""global"" doesn't mean ""one size fits all."" Marketing done well is<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/""> targeted and tailored</a>; in order for it to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">resonate with audiences</a> it must be relevant. What a buyer in urban Japan finds relevant may be much different than what appeals to a buyer in rural Canada. Your buyer personas should incorporate local preferences and be updated periodically.

It's also important to have feedback from people who are well-versed in any new markets you're about to enter. We've all heard the horror stories about mistranslations. Pepsi's ""come alive with Pepsi"" campaign was literally translated as <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/13-hilarious-slogans-lost-in-translation-2011-10"">""Pepsi brings you’re ancestors back from the dead""</a> in Mandarin, while Coors brewery's ""Turn it loose"" campaign in Spain was colloquially translated as ""this product will cause diarrhea.""

<strong>Navigating local cultures, idioms and laws</strong>

Translations aren't the only potential trouble spot; when you aim for a global market, it's imperative to consider questions of cultural sensitivity. Additionally, not everything translates across cultures and languages. A brilliant tagline might fall utterly flat in another culture or language. Local expertise is the best way to ensure mistakes aren't made, whether that means consulting with someone informally or finding a local business partner.

When in doubt, it's a good idea to aim for the universal -- something that is recognizable and all-inclusive. You can still add local twists and flair to universal content.

Even if your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/"">creative work</a> is calibrated for global appeal, you should also be cognizant of jurisdictional differences. The rules and regulations governing marketing and sales vary from place to place -- some areas are highly regulated when it comes to spam, user privacy, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a>, etc. are a virtual free for all. Awareness of these differences are a key part of successful global marketing strategies.

Developing creative work that's global in nature and negotiating the intricacies of jurisdictional compliance can be a tall order for some small-to-mid-sized firms. That's one reason why it's often a smart idea to partner with an agency that specializes in global marketing campaigns. Luckily, agencies like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> have the knowledge to avoid pitfalls and enough experience to understand where costs can be reduced (one example: by building an internal database of words or phrases you've previously translated, you can dramatically lower external translation fees).

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Thanks to modern technology the barriers to entry for global <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">marketing campaign</a> are lower than ever. Before you get started, however, we encourage you to weigh all of the above considerations carefully.

How to incorporate drone video into your social media content,"Drones, with their incredible precision and flexibility, can offer truly astonishing bird's eye views. Reduced costs have also put them within the budgetary range of virtually any business. DJI -- the largest manufacturer in the consumer drone market -- <a href=""https://www.recode.net/2017/4/14/14690576/drone-market-share-growth-charts-dji-forecast"">sells commercial-grade products for less than $500</a>. Less full-featured products can be purchased for significantly less.

<strong>Incorporating drone video into your offerings</strong>

We've discussed how <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/drone-video-services/"">drone footage attracts</a> the eye and commands attention. So how does one incorporate it into social platforms? After you've decided which hardware product is right for you, it all comes down to creative execution.

For example, if you're in the business of selling homes, you might use a drone to take aerial photography of certain neighborhoods. A travel agency might use drone footage to the same effect, highlighting hotspots and amenities. If you're not in a business that lends itself to drone footage, you can still use a drone to record employees engaging in activities such as hiking, mountain climbing, running a marathon or anything else.

Drones have the ability to make even routing activities appear striking, thanks to the unusual angles they provide. If used to good effect, they can make a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social feed much more dynamic and engaging</a>.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/drone-video-services/"">drone technology</a> <span class=""m-3609652771017264093m-7286756533773021930gmail-gr"">has become</span> more available, the use of aerial camera footage has become a social media differentiator. As drones continue to evolve, the content they create will become even more compelling. If you aren't considering incorporating drone footage already, we urge you to do so.

Six key elements for an engaging creative annual report design,"While they contain vital information, even the most diligent reader can have difficulty sustaining concentration while wading through line after line of information. Retention can suffer as a result.

Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem: Creative annual report design. By presenting relevant information in an engagingly creative format, you can help readers stay focused, better understand the material and then retain what they've read.

<strong>Six Elements of creative annual report design</strong>

Nobody likes wading through blocks of featureless, jargon-heavy text. Yet that's too often what we find in annual report design. To help keep things fresh and appealing, let's take a look at some common <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/"">creative elements</a> you can incorporate into your next report:

<em>1. Commit to a more <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">visual approach</a>.</em> This is a fundamental first step toward overhauling your design. It should start with your cover photo or graphic; use something truly eye-catching to grab the reader's attention right away. Incorporate <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">visual design</a> elements throughout your report to help offset word-heavy sections. Remember, today's readers and viewers have become conditioned to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">videos</a>, infographics, etc. Wading through an annual report that appears to be preserved in amber from the 1950s is a guaranteed engagement killer.

<em>2. Use punchy and concise subheads, bullet lists, and other elements to break up text blocks. </em>Readers don't like long winding paragraphs -- unless they're reading 19th century Russian literature. Make your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copy</a> digestible.

<em>3. Consider your narrative.</em> What <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">story is your business telling</a> about itself this year? What's the best way to lay out that story? How can you best use visuals to support and explain that narrative? Consider weaving in historical information about your company via the use of sidebars.

<em>4. Data visualization.</em> We mentioned infographics earlier. Annual reports are <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">data-rich documents</a> and graphics are a key tool in making critical information stand out. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/"">Research</a> also shows infographics help readers <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2017/10/19/the-data-is-in-infographics-are-growing-and-thriving-in-2017-and-beyond/"">learn and retain more efficiently.</a>

<em>5. Think about the medium.</em> You don't have to publish on glossy paper -- many organizations choose to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">use websites</a> or other, more interactive mediums for annual reports.

<em>6. Master white space.</em> Remember, heavy text is an engagement killer. Creative use of white space makes information more digestible -- and also makes your aesthetics much more appealing.

<strong>The takeaway                                                                                        </strong>

Your annual report design doesn't have to be a dry and dull affair. Consider implementing the ideas we've listed above to freshen up your report and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/quantitative-research-services/"">keep your readers engaged</a>.

How voice technology is transforming the healthcare industry,"In the healthcare field, the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a> platforms developed by both businesses (Amazon Alexa and Google Home) have been lauded by medical practitioners and developers alike.

It's not difficult to see why the interest has been so apparent. While voice interaction has been a resounding success in the consumer market, allowing users to save time by automating essential home functions, its applications in business and organizational contexts are just now being explored.
One thing, however, is certain: As voice technology matures, its effect on the healthcare industry operations will be profound.

<strong>How voice technology changes how patient care is delivered</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Voice app development</a> in the medical field is somewhat constrained by the fact that most major voice tech products are not yet HIPAA compliant (though Amazon and others are working to achieve this). Yet even working within these limitations, developers have already made remarkable strides toward making healthcare more efficient and accurate.

Medical centers are using Alexa and other platforms to transmit routine medical data to patients in their homes. Hospitals are also using voice technology to help with surgical note taking or record keeping. Voice technology also has a crucial role to play in helping people become more involved in their own health care.

<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/medwatcher-for-drugs-vaccines/id391767048?mt=8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">One app</a>, as well as many others, created by Boston Children's Hospital, allows users to access information about common medical conditions and prescription medicine dosage. Apps such as these can help deliver much-needed information virtually instantly, without the need to waste time performing manual searches.
Communicating via voice, rather than having an experience that's mediated by a screen, has immense potential for helping patients become more engaged with their own health. This will ultimately give them the power and agency necessary to make substantial improvements to their own lives.

<strong>What the future holds</strong>

While these initial developments are quite promising, they represent merely the first steps toward deeper voice technology integration with healthcare services. Some of the world's most prominent medical centers are experimenting with voice technology in an effort to build applications that will transform how hospitals operate and how patients are treated.

Third party voice application developers are busy dreaming up innovative new uses for Alexa and her competitors in healthcare settings. Amazon is busy supporting this wave of development; one example is a recent <a href=""https://www.merck.com/about/featured-stories/merck-amazon.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">software development challenge</a> the company co-hosted with pharmaceutical giant Merck. Developers were tasked with finding creative voice technology solutions to help people manage chronic conditions such as diabetes.

Devices such as Alexa are well-suited to help people manage these chronic conditions. By asking simple questions such as ""have you taken your medication today?"" Alexa and other platforms can help ensure that patients remain compliant with their treatment needs. This is critically important, as some studies have shown up to 50-percent of patients do not comply with their dosing schedule -- a problem that has massive public health consequences.

<strong>The takeaway </strong>

Voice technology has a major role to play in the healthcare field -- and we've only begun to see this impact take shape. Our firm has been at the forefront of this trend, and we've used our expertise to help clients in a variety of fields harness the power of voice technology to improve their own processes.
In the coming days and weeks, we'll publish more content explaining how voice technology can benefit both hospitals and patients by driving better financial and personal health outcomes.

"Doctors, nurses and voice technology: Three pillars of healthcare","Today, Amazon's Alexa (along with devices from Google and Apple) provide a near seamless user experience and perform fairly complex tasks. This, of course, is still only the beginning. Amazon has been vocal about its desire to extend Alexa's reach virtually everywhere. The goal is to create access to voice technology platforms in every setting, from smart thermostats to smart refrigerators.

Ultimately, Amazon aims to have developers embed <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-voice-technology-is-transforming-the-healthcare-industry/"">Alexa's technology</a> in all kinds of objects -- and one of the spaces where Alexa is already seeing significant integration is the healthcare sector.

<strong>Paging Dr. Alexa?</strong>

Across the world IT departments at major medical centers, along with third party voice app developers, are busy figuring out new and novel ways to incorporate Alexa and Google Home into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-voice-technology-is-transforming-the-healthcare-industry/"">healthcare settings</a>.

It's not difficult to understand why those in the healthcare sector are so intrigued by the possibilities offered by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a>. It's a life or death business where even a relatively small mistake can have deadly consequences. Any technology that can increase efficiency while reducing errors (and subsequently lowering potential liability costs) will be heartily embraced.

Ashraf Shehata, a partner at KPMG's Global Healthcare Center of Excellence, reports that Alexa is continually <a href=""https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/11/21/why-hospitals-arent-giving-alexa-and-google-home-the-silent-treatment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">becoming more sophisticate</a>d in terms of responding to health care requests. In other word's, she's becoming smarter over time.

Currently, Alexa is being used to help surgeons run through pre-procedure safety checklists, photograph, log and timestamp comments made during surgery and log patient notes between caregiver shifts. All of these functions not only improve health care processes, they also help protect against liability by enhancing safety and accuracy while providing a clear digital record.

Additionally, voice technology is used to help patients follow their prescription dosages, <a href=""https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-introduce-first-aid-skill-for-amazon-alexa/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">identify and treat minor illnesses</a> and even route them to the medical center with the lowest patient backlog. Alexa and Google Home also offer access to a large and continually growing digital content library of health care information. Users can access information about symptoms, illnesses, medications and treatments with a simple voice command.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice technology</a> also has the potential to transform administrative tasks. Anyone who has worked in the healthcare space understands the enormous amount of time that's spent record keeping, scheduling and dealing with supply chain issues. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice technology</a> platforms can simplify and streamline these processes, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient care and other areas where the most value is added.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Voice technology is already impacting patient care for the better, but we are still at the very beginning of a profound transformation. Those who start adapting early will receive the greatest benefits in terms of efficiency, accuracy and productivity.

Third party developers play a key role in helping businesses and organizations unlock the true potential of Alexa and other services. If your organization could benefit from the implementation of a world-class voice technology application, don't hesitate to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">contact us</a> for more information.",,4/27/2018 12:13,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Doctors-Nurses-and-Amazons-Alexa-Healthcares-Future-Pillars.jpg,doctors-nurses-and-voice-technology-three-pillars-of-healthcare,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How hospitals & medical centers are incorporating voice technology,"A smart, reliable voice assistant makes life easier -- and in turn helps make us more productive. The truth is that we live in a world where mobile and smart devices are used for almost everything. By moving these functions from a smartphone to a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice assistant</a>, the experience becomes simpler and less mediated. Having the power of the Internet not merely at our fingertips, but also ready to be activated at the sound of our voice, is a development with massive implications -- not only at home, but also in the workplace.

One key example: Hospitals, where the stakes couldn't be higher and the need for innovative technological solutions is ever-present, are on the verge of experiencing a patient-care transformation facilitated by voice apps in healthcare.

<strong>The growing presence of Alexa in healthcare</strong>

Within medical centers, the shift from desktops to laptops -- and later from laptops to mobile -- was a significant one. Today, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a> is supplementing mobile and may largely replace it within the next decade. Recently <a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/special-report-ai-voice-assistants-have-officially-arrived-healthcare"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Healthcare IT News</a> took a close look at how voice technology is being deployed at several prominent hospitals.

At Beth Israel Medical Center in Boston, Amazon Alexa development is in full swing. A team of IT professionals and developers have created applications that allow patients to ask Alexa (or Google Home) to call for a nurse, check what's on the evening menu, find out when a physician is arriving and other fundamental tasks.
Normally, many such activities would require the attention of a medical professional. By using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a> to automate these processes, hospitals are providing timelier services and freeing up personnel for value-added tasks.

At Northwell Health in New York, IT teams are developing with Alexa and Google Home. Here, they use cases for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a> that include letting patients know how long they will be waiting in emergency rooms and directing them to nearby urgent care centers.

Once mature, the technology would allow someone who slices open a finger while preparing a meal to ask Alexa which nearby medical center has the shortest wait period. Because Alexa is integrated with Northwell's app, she can query local hospitals and urgent cares and provide an optimal solution within seconds using real-time data. This allows those who are injured to get treatment quickly, while also reducing bottlenecks at local hospitals.

Finally, Libertana Home Health is leveraging voice technology to help elderly clients live independently. Alexa is not only a useful tool to help people remember appointments and medication schedules, but it also provides a form of social interaction.

A pilot study conducted by the organization showed that voice assistants can help reduce loneliness by interacting with the elderly. Alexa can be programmed to play cognitive games that enhance memory and deliver daily personalized greetings.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Voice technology is helping to transform patient care. Our agency has been at the forefront of this developing trend, creating deeply useful third-party apps that allow organizations to unlock the full power of voice technology.

If you need assistance with Amazon Alexa development or Google Home programming, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/new-biz/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">we'd love to help</a> do the same for you.",,4/30/2018 8:18,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/How-hospitals-are-using-amazon-alexa-and-google-home.jpeg,how-hospitals-are-incorporating-voice-technology,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How voice technology is optimizing at home health care,"Remember <a href=""https://www.aol.com/2009/08/24/as-seen-on-tv-the-classic-clapper-withstands-the-test-of-time/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">“The Clapper”</a>? That home electronic device of the 90s (with omnipresent late night commercials), that turned your lights on and off with the sound of a clap? In many ways, it represented a somewhat crude first step toward the truly amazing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology devices</a> of today, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home.

“The Clapper” also represented something else: A technological solution for a very real problem. Older people, often with limited mobility, sometimes struggle to perform common household tasks such as turning lights off and on.

Thanks to Alexa and her voice technology counterparts, we've already progressed far beyond mere light switching. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice technology</a> platforms and applications are being used to make hospital operations and patient care more efficient, accurate and productive.

And in the field of home healthcare, they are poised to do much the same.

<strong>Voice technology in home health care</strong>

“The Clapper” isn't the only early voice tech device with a history of iconic late-night TV ads. Medical alert bracelets and necklaces (first popularized by a series of commercials created by Life Alert, featuring the now famous phrase ""I've fallen, and I can't get up!"") are designed to send for help if an elderly person becomes incapacitated inside their home.

Much like “The Clapper”, this device performs an important function -- and one that's been almost entirely supplanted in terms of utility by Alexa and Google Home. Instead of manually pressing a button and waiting for medical personnel to respond, elderly or disabled residents can use a simple voice command to summon immediate help.

And that's only one application of the technology. Globally, home healthcare firms and their employees are using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology services</a> to ensure patients stay on their prescribed medication schedule and follow physician instructions following surgery or an office visit.

One example of this in action is Amazon's <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/amazon-alexa-diabetes-challenge-offers-125000-prize.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent partnership with the pharmaceutical giant Merck</a>. The two companies offered developers a $125,000 prize to develop a voice technology application designed to help diabetes patients monitor and manage their condition.

Amazon Alexa and Google Home not only serve as an ever-growing repository of critical personal data, they also reduce the level of friction needed to access that information -- along with making simple household tasks or calls for help faster and easier.

Studies have also shown that isolation and loneliness can have <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3536512/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">seriously negative effects</a> on the health and well-being of older people or the disabled. Voice technology platforms can also play an important role in this regard. As the technology grows more powerful and refined, interaction becomes more seamless and life-like, making people feel more connected and less isolated.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice technology</a> is transforming the way healthcare is delivered both in a hospital and at home. It's important, however, to rely on third party developers who have the requisite experience and skill to maximize the potential of voice applications.

4 Secrets to a more sustainable user acquisition plan,"No business can survive without one, key ingredient: customers. Bringing in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">new customers</a> -- formally known as “user acquisition” -- should be one of your company’s most important (and lucrative) business goals. User acquisition is a blanket term used to describe interconnected activities, such as content creation, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a>, conversion funnel <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">analysis</a>, marketing automation, and SEO efforts. Whether your goal is more app users, site visitors, or sales, the user acquisition process is built upon the same, systematic process.

At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we believe in educating our customers on how to take their user acquisition efforts as far as they can, on their own, before stepping in to take things to the next level. In that spirit, here are four tools our team recommends to help you create more sustainable pipelines that won’t take your team more than ten minutes to implement. You can also visit <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">our services page</a> to learn how we can partner together on your acquisition strategy.

<strong>1. Understand why your user acquisition cost is so important </strong>

Before you do anything else, start by understanding your user acquisition cost (UAC). This figure represents the amount of money your company spends attracting new users. Your goal is to make that cost as low as humanly possible while still being effective. When measuring against the lifetime value of your customers (CLV), a good benchmark is 3:1 value to cost. Stay on target by designating a percentage of your current year’s CLV and only spend that amount. If you find yourself burning through your budget, it’s time to assess whether your user acquisition tactics are effective and seek out areas for optimization.

<strong>2. Give your content a facelift </strong>

Blog posts naturally sink to the bottom of your website architecture as time passes, but that doesn’t make your content (or keywords inside) less valuable. Repurposing your best material gives you the opportunity to re-promote highly effective or potentially viral content via social media, generate new backlinks as your audience expands, and direct crawler attention to desired search terms. And no, this isn’t cheating. Consider <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guide-to-updating-republishing-blogging-content-ht"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">HubSpot</a>, which generates over 250 blog posts each month. They regularly refresh great content that is valuable to their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">target audience</a>. And so should you.

<strong>3. Don't let low hanging fruit get in the way of user acquisition </strong>

All the work you put into leveraging content to bring in new users won’t matter if those users can’t find your site. Start with low hanging fruit. Look for crawler errors and 404 pages, check your site speed, and delete outdated content. Reference your target keywords against the metadata on your pages, then do a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">competitive analysis</a> to make sure you have the budget and content to compete on them. While these activities may not seem directly linked to a strong user acquisition strategy, we’d argue that they are the foundation of effective SEO, customer discovery, and entry into your marketing funnel - making them critically important. Through this process, site tech debt will decrease and you can begin building more nuanced keywords and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">linking strategies</a>, rather than focusing on clean up. This will help new customers easily find your site and navigate to the information they need, on the right platform, at the right time.

<strong>4. Boost your email user acquisition in one easy step </strong>

Boost your leads by buying lists from complementary brands. A personalized welcome email creates early <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">engagement with your brand</a>, while relevant and consistent content makes your emails a delight rather than a delete. Even if your email open rate is strong, there’s still room to improve (unless you’re at 100%). Double your effectiveness by sending an email, then resending thatsame email – with a different subject - to only the individuals who didn’t open the first email. By changing the subject and resending the origianl email you can boost your email open rates by 20 - 30% with a simple click of a button.

New multi-channel video measurement will change media buying,"The most successful brands, apps, and websites <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">connect to their audience</a> in ways that fit seamlessly into consumers lifestyles by bridging rich content -- like multi-channel video and highly personalized posts -- across platforms and devices. A sparkling example of multi-platform marketing comes from startup darling <a href=""https://www.renttherunway.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Rent the Runway</a> (RTR), which lets users rent clothes for special occasions. The brand boasts an Apple App Store <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rent-the-runway/id672853806?mt=8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rating of 4.8</a>, 6 million users, and over <a href=""https://www.inc.com/magazine/201707/zoe-henry/jennifer-fleiss-rent-the-runway.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">$100 million in revenue</a>.

To achieve these impressive stats, RTR creates unique content for each platform that lets users navigate their purchases, engage with the RTR community, and share special moments: a true lifestyle brand. Until this fall, marketers have had a difficult time quantifying how important multi-channel video content - like that featured on RTR - can be. But Nielsen just changed that by adding Facebook, Hulu, and YouTube video views to their standard <a href=""http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2017/media-publishers-to-receive-credit-for-viewing-on-facebook--hulu.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">media publishing metrics</a>.

<strong> Neilsen adds multi-channel video to their performance </strong>

Nielsen Holdings is considered the gold-standard in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">performance management</a> in the United States. Nielsen tracks what customers buy, where they buy it, what ads influenced their purchase, and how content impacts consumer experience. Specifically, Neilsen’s Watch let’s marketing agencies and media publishers like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">BIGEYE</a> measure what and where video content is being consumed. Nielsen has revolutionized performance management with this change, and we are excited to tell you why your business will benefit.

<strong>Finally! – Accuracy measuring multi-channel video </strong>

Big and small brands look to agency partners to help them craft the perfect <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing</a> spend. The seeming witchcraft of choosing how much to invest in a video campaign, a PPC advertisement, and native search optimization is one part art and one part science that most companies simply don’t have the bandwidth for. Accurate measurement and channel ratings - delivered by performance management companies like Nielsen - help agencies make accurate decisions to optimize plan efficiency.

Neilsen’s new digital content ratings are good for publishers and advertisers alike. It showcases how much streaming video content is consumed, informing agency publishers about how their audience is finding and responding to their content so they can improve their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">creative strategy</a> and corresponding spend. It also supports a fairer marketing landscape. As Nielsen SVP of Product Leadership, Jessica Hogue explains in a <a href=""http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2017/the-key-to-unlocking-the-future-of-media-measurement-flexibility.print.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">corporate blog post</a>, this new measurement provides “a more consistent and transparent view [that] ensures a level playing field with access to the same information across content creators, advertisers, and platforms.”

<strong>A more holistic view of cross-channel marketing </strong>Hold on to your hats and advertisements - the hottest and most talked about multi-channel video trend of 2018 will surprise you.

Nielsen’s new ratings also allow agencies to formulate a more complete picture of how cross-channel content works together. As an example, understanding the true count of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/web-video-production-agency/"">multi-channel video</a> might allow a content-centric brand such as Buzzfeed to invest more deeply in content creation for one channel versus another, or focus their optimization efforts around a particularly valuable audience segment. In a <a href=""http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/media-publishers-receive-credit-viewing-facebook-hulu-and-youtube-through-nielsen-digital-content"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">related press release</a>, Edwin Wong, VP of Research and Insights at BuzzFeed, agrees that “with this new tool at our disposal, we are able to have a clearer view of BuzzFeed’s true reach,” which broadens the traditionally narrow view of how content performs on a given channel.

Anything that allows for more accurately tracked content across channels is a win for us. When backed by a name like Nielsen and their outstanding methodology, you really can’t go wrong.

Your next hotel deal is here thanks to Facebook dynamic ads,"Facebook dynamic ads help travel and hospitality brands get the word out about their destination and entice future guests with perks and experiences just a plane ride away. Facebook dynamic ads tailor content across devices and platforms to serve customers information about the locations, dates, flights, and destinations they have signaled to buy on Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network.

Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts participated in a case study for Facebook dynamic ads, boasting a 20% increase in revenue, a 34% decrease in cost per booking, a 55% increase in mobile revenue, and a 44% decrease in mobile cost per booking. In efforts to help more businesses achieve these results in partnership with us, we wanted to understand the four W’s that make this tool effective. We dug deeper into the what, why, when, and who to help you make an informed decision about whether Facebook dynamic ads are right for your business.

<strong>What: So what makes Facebook dynamic ads so special </strong>

At first glance, Facebook dynamic ads might simply seem like a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">retargeting campaign</a>, but these ads pack a serious punch. These full-screen dazzlers are fully customizable. And if the lush, carousel photo option doesn’t catch your customers’ attention, strike-out pricing and promotion overlays, or real-time inventory updates certainly will. These ads are the closest thing a customer can get to actual search results without searching for themselves.

<strong>Why: Knowing why your customers browse leads to sales</strong>

Because Facebook uses hyper-specific user data to capture intent to browse or intent to purchase, advertisers can “set it and forget it” when using Facebook dynamic ads. The user funnel will adapt to fit the needs of the traveler based on new signals and the business based on live KPIs and inventory. By recognizing why a user is browsing, the ads can serve exactly what someone is looking for, or make related recommendations resulting in up- or cross-sales that would have never been possible otherwise.

<strong>When: Travel is time-bound … and your ads should be too </strong>

Have you ever seen a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeted ad</a> or special offer too late? Facebook dynamic ads automatically adjusts or turns off based on when users check-out date or flight times have passed. This tool keeps ads relevant, pleasing both the traveler who is seeing content personalized to their needs and the business that isn’t wasting money on travelers who already got back from their holiday.

<strong>Who: Personalization is key</strong>

Facebook dynamic ads can funnel clicks to a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">personalized landing page</a>. In a sense, these ads become mini-travel agents that make the shopping process feel more curated or luxurious. Hotel brands can optimize based on location and price, recommend their sister properties if dates are sold out, or partner activities and attractions, giving the ads broader relevance to the consumer.

Like all strong advertising tools, you need to have inspiring content to go with it. If your hospitality brand needs a lift, we can help you create the Facebook dynamic ads campaign that will get you there and the content that will make it all worthwhile. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">Click here</a> to learn more about our creative content services and how they can transform this next wave of highly personalized customer outreach.",,5/7/2018 1:47,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Your-next-hotel-deal-is-here-thanks-to-Facebook-dynamic-ads.jpg,your-next-hotel-deal-is-here-thanks-to-facebook-dynamic-ads,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Sequential marketing explained: A new approach for lead conversion,"The best marketing ideas are also designed to work hand in glove with our natural tendencies as consumers. That's exactly what s<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-to-develop-a-successful-sequential-marketing-plan/"">equential marketing</a> campaigns are designed to do. As humans, we love narratives, patterns and puzzles. For as long as people have been entertaining each other, we've known the value of a good story -- or a dramatic cliffhanger.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-to-develop-a-successful-sequential-marketing-plan/"">Sequential marketing</a> takes advantage of this tendency by presenting a sequenced narrative of ads that can be viewed across a variety of devices. Today's brands are using sequential marketing techniques to first convey their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">story or message</a> before moving people through the sales funnel. It's an approach that has proven remarkably effective, as studies have shown that sequenced ads of this sort are far more effective than non-sequenced ads.

<strong>The basics of sequential marketing</strong>

To help break down the process a little further, let's take a closer look at how it all works.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-to-develop-a-successful-sequential-marketing-plan/"">Sequential marketing</a> can be simply summed up as a series of ads served to prospective customers in sequential order across a range of devices, including laptops, mobile, and tablets. Typically, these ads will tell a story of some sort that's designed to engage the reader or viewer and convince them to take the next step of their sales journey.

The data we have on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-to-develop-a-successful-sequential-marketing-plan/"">sequential marketing</a> underscores its efficacy. According to a recent <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/news/value-of-storytelling-on-facebook"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study published by Facebook</a>, people exposed to sequential marketing techniques are 87-percent more likely to visit a landing page than those who don't see sequenced ads. Additionally, the value of sequencing rises the longer the sequences carry on; ads with three sequences, for example, performed better than two sequence ads, which in turn outperform conventional ads.

Facebook admits that some marketers may find this counterintuitive; in a world where the demands on our attention are legion, doesn't it make more sense to quickly and forcefully present a prospect with a call to action?

As this research shows, the opposite is typically true. Humans are social animals -- we love narratives and stories. When done properly, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-to-develop-a-successful-sequential-marketing-plan/"">sequential marketing</a> plays directly in to these tendencies and harnesses them for the benefit of the brand.

<strong>Sequential marketing in action</strong>

To further crystallize the concept of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-to-develop-a-successful-sequential-marketing-plan/"">sequential marketing</a>, let's outline an example. A consumer is browsing a website on her smartphone searching for a new piece of jewelry. As she browses, she sees a video that tells the story of another woman -- one who received the same piece of jewelry as a wedding gift.

Then, the next time the consumer logs in (perhaps this time on her laptop), she sees a new ad that picks up where the last ad left off. This time, she sees a woman wearing the same jewelry going through milestones in her life-- raising children, attending graduations, etc. The sequential ads are designed to tell a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">compelling story</a> about this woman that's aimed specifically at a given buyer persona, based on data that's been gathered and analyzed.

If this is executed skillfully and paired with smart attribution modeling and high-quality leads, the impact on sales is significant. The sequenced narrative resonates with the prospective customer, and she progresses through the sales journey with enthusiasm.

How to develop a successful sequential marketing plan,"As we detailed in our previous post, sequential marketing offers brands an innovative and fresh approach for consumer engagement. By creating compelling and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">emotionally resonant narratives</a> -- and presenting them as advertisements in sequential order across a variety of devices or platforms -- businesses are <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/news/value-of-storytelling-on-facebook"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">reaping extraordinary benefits</a> in terms of customer engagement and sales.

Now that we've explained the essentials of the idea, it's time to outline best practices for crafting a sequential marketing strategy. By doing so, you can help ensure that your organization remains perched at the vanguard of modern <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a> approaches.

<strong>Developing a successful sequential marketing plan</strong>

Like most campaigns, a great sequential marketing plan begins with a commitment to original, creative and evoking content. If the story your brand is telling is dramatically inert, the most precise modeling or insightful buyer personas won't be of much assistance. Leads must find the story being told interesting and relevant. Ideally, it should also spark some emotional connection -- the excitement of seeing something truly unexpected, or the shock of recognition that comes when you identify with a story unfolding on your screen.

Stories don't need to follow a single formula or template, at least creatively speaking, but there should be some common areas of focus. These include identifying why a prospective customer would benefit from your product or service, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/crisis-communication-company/"">establishing the problems</a> or pain points presented, then outlining how they can be resolved. Only after the full narrative has been unspooled for the lead, a call to action or another prompt designed to move the sales process forward should be presented.

These various elements may be present in different ad sequences. For example, the first sequence may simply introduce the brand to increase awareness. The second sequence may focus on problems solved or benefits offered, while the final sequence delivers a prompt for further action.

<strong>Beyond the story</strong>

A commitment to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">exceptional story content</a> should be paired with the necessary supporting elements: High-quality leads, well thought out and researched buyer personas, and actionable customer data. Questions such as ""who is your customer?” ""which devices will she use?"" and ""where do her interests lie?"" are all critical inquiries.

Sequential marketing is more sophisticated (and often more resource intensive) than other conventional forms of marketing. Because of this, they are generally seen by previous customers or leads who have shown a demonstrated interest in a product or service. Since multi-stage narratives are typically employed, targeting leads with the same sequenced ad multiple times may quickly lead to diminishing returns or ad fatigue -- many people simply won't want to sit through a story they've already seen, even if they enjoy it.

It's also important to tailor your ad approach for the platform you're using. Facebook offers several tools for sequential ads, including the ability to schedule dozens of ads ahead of time. Snapchat, meanwhile, has added a sequential ad capability to its Discover channel. Marketers can take longer videos and trim them into a few short sequences by using this tool.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Sequential marketing offers brands an innovative method for targeting high-value leads and converting them with greater efficiency. We encourage you to consider the ideas outlined above when developing your next sequential marketing plan.

Going beyond clickbait: How to really create a high impact ad,"Digital ads sometimes get a bad reputation for relying on clickbait to generate views. However, we believe that a true high impact ad can drive consumer engagement and build a relationship with your brand. Successful high impact ad units are easier to build than you think once you know the types of content that motivate and inspire your audience.

Our team can <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/"">help you create</a> engaging, content-rich ads that entice your audience to learn more. For inspiration, we want to share a few of our favorite high impact ad formats and when to use them.

<strong>Pre-Roll High Impact Ads: </strong>

There’s nothing new about pre-roll ads. They were one of the <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/infographic-the-history-of-video-advertising-on-youtube/242836/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">first high impact ad</a> formats to hit the scene in 2007, just three years after YouTube.com web live. But they work. Pre-roll ads appear before a viewer watches streaming content such as a YouTube video, or a show on Hulu or Netflix. Because consumers are used to seeing previews before movies, the format isn’t jarring or unexpected. Most viewers have to wait a before they click out of an ad, giving your team an opportunity to show off their creative chops with something that will grab viewers’ attention before the dreaded “skip ad” button appears. If your content is good enough, viewers will want to share - not skip - your ad.

<strong>Reactive Animation, Takeovers, and Splash Screens: </strong>

Banner ads and pop ups appear statically and can be removed or avoided with the simple scroll of a mouse or or click of an “X.” By simply replacing these weak advertising tools with high impact ads you can lift viewer engagement by 67%, similar to a recent <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/advertising/advertising-stats-week-dynamic-takeover-ads-beat-banners-225628443.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study done by Yahoo</a>. Reactive animations (which slide down the screen in line with your content), takeovers (which disrupt the entire surface of the user’s tablet, phone, or monitor), and splash screens (which overlay a page’s content), are all more immersive options that force the user to take a pause and digest your content -- hopefully deciding that it is worth their time -- and exploring further.

<strong>Push Advertisements: </strong>

On the other end of the spectrum, push ads make advertising less intrusive by allowing the viewer to slide down a page’s content with a standard accordion or shelf feature. Viewers can open and close the ad depending on how relevant it is or how much time they want to spend on that content. Because this UX feature is common on many websites and apps as a way to organize information, it creates viewing consistency with whatever your audience is already looking at and makes ad content feel more natural. While making ads blend into the background may seem counterintuitive, this practice reduces negative feelings triggered by traditional ad units, making viewers more likely to focus on your message rather than automatically tuning out ad content.

<strong>Interactive Banner Ads: </strong>

In your next ad, try using gamification, allow users to drag and drop information in the ad field, or create a playful, interactive call to action that focuses on sharing knowledge rather than making a sale. Over 63% of consumers said they were annoyed by ads featuring overt sales pitches according to a study by <a href=""https://research.hubspot.com/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers?__hstc=93759874.0dd47395701e586a2053d7870aa748b0.1510079178415.1510079178415.1510079178415.1&amp;__hssc=93759874.1.1510079178416&amp;__hsfp=2159981971"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">HubSpot</a>. Instead, viewers opted for ads embedded in rich imagery and interactive content. Interactive ads allow you to create a warm, welcoming experience rather than a transactional pitch, which will increase qualified leads and reduce bounce rate. Because clicks will result from genuine interest in our brand and content rather than a short-term promotion or sale, these visitors are also more likely to return to your site again.

A/B split testing: Timeless benefits of conversion optimization,"Tried and tested <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a> methodology, like A/B split testing or growth hacking, ebbs and flows in popularity based on the latest trends in market. While we like to stay on the bleeding edge of digital techniques, we encourage all our clients to stay true to their testing roots.

There are few more simple and effective <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing tactics</a> than A/B split testing. In case it’s been a while since you have reviewed your testing roadmap, here are a few reasons why a robust A/B split testing culture is important for your business, or feel free to <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">learn more</a> about the types of testing support our team can provide.

<strong>1. There Are No Bad Ideas:</strong>

Consistent, A/B split testing supports a constructive space for your team members to share ideas. Because testing allows you to try ideas safely and quickly, every team member can see their ideas make it to the light of day to be validated through data, or trumped by a preferable guest experience. When team members see their ideas live, they will feel more ownership over their work. Understanding test results will also help them understand their customers’ preferences, and ultimately uplevel your ideation process as the virtuous feedback loop created by testing allows your team to make more choiceful decisions about what your content looks like and where it lives within your digital ecosystem.

<strong>2. Ditch the HIPPOs:</strong>

HIPPOs - or the friendly acronym for the highest paid person’s opinions - sometimes distract team members from pushing for a less popular, but potentially more impactful, ideas. A/B split testing disrupts this hierarchy and grounds decisions in data, according to behavior studies from the <a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/02/ab-testing-and-the-benefits-of-an-experimentation-culture"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Harvard Business Review</a>. Testing is an easy way for individual contributors to let their voices be heard, break through groupthink, or squash any embarrassment the team might have about telling a senior leader there may be other options. The data speaks for itself.

<strong>3. Fail Fast, Learn Quick:</strong>

A/B split testing also dramatically reduces risk when introducing revolutionary ideas into market. Because you can control what percentage of your audience sees various test branches, this allows your team to take more meaningful risk instead of taking safe, but less impactful, swings to drive results and incremental value for your customers. You can safely try, then scale semi-crazy ideas, or experiment with new features and pricing lineups knowing only 5% or 10% of your customers will see it until you’re ready.

<strong>4. Show Me The Money:</strong>

Last, but certainly not least, A/B split testing makes sense (and cents) for your bottom line. According to <a href=""https://blog.optimizely.com/2014/01/08/ab-testing-advantage-infographic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Optimizely</a>, testing drove an average lift of 20% in revenue within the e-commerce sector, and nearly 70% increases in lead generation within the SaaS world. Testing accelerates business growth by allowing you to get a clearer understanding of your customer and what works faster so you can stay competitive within the market.

How packaging design services can transform your brand,"95% of new products fail every year according to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/31/brand-flops-apple-ford-pepsi-coors-cmo-network-brand-fail.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Forbes</a>. And we want to help change that statistic through our revolutionary <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">packaging design services</a>. Aside from keeping your products safe for shipping and distribution, packaging is the calling card of your brand.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">Packaging</a> helps customers decide whether they want to buy your product before they try it, which is why we don’t recommend skimping on this important extension of your brand. When partnering with a creative agency to help bring your vision to life, make sure they have a deep understanding of the following four packing success indicators: function, cost, scalability, and brand alignment.

<strong>Function: </strong>
Your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaging</a> should keep your products fresh, safe, and clean — based on the goods you’re selling, how fragile they are, and whether or not they have a shelf life. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">Packaging design services</a> agencies should have unbeatable, niche insight into the types of materials best suited to protect your product, whether there are any government restrictions or guidelines for shipping and packing, and how to mitigate any risks your products may be exposed to while reaching their final destination.

<strong>Cost: </strong>
The quality of your packaging is a direct reflection of the quality of your brand. With that in mind, high-quality packaging does not always need to be expensive. Your creative agency can help you identify areas to cut cost, without sacrificing quality. They will work with you to understand what trends and design techniques will give you the look you want for less, and how shipping costs might factor into your total budget.

<strong>Scalability:</strong>
While sending a personalized note with every shipment may seem like a charming, high-quality touch, this is not scalable as your business grows. New businesses dazzle customers early with unique, memorable packaging, but lose an edge when cost and time forces them to cut back on the experience.<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/""> Packaging design services </a>experts will help you create packaging that is personal, on-brand, and scalable by volume.

<strong>Brand Alignment: </strong>
<a href=""http://www.tiffany.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Tiffany’s &amp; Co</a> signature blue boxes and <a href=""http://www.apple.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Apple’s </a>sleek, streamlined containers are almost as recognizable as their products themselves. This level of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand alignment</a> helps potential customers understand your products more deeply and determine whether your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand values</a> are aligned with their lifestyle. Signature packaging, like Tiffany’s, can also become a draw for your customers when leveraged properly across channels to tell a unique <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">story about your brand</a>.

Nailing these four guidelines doesn’t guarantee your packaging won’t need some fine tuning, or that you won’t want to update your look as your brand evolves. Your agency partner will work alongside your brand to ensure your packaging stays current through testing with small focus groups, experimenting with cheap-chic materials, and gathering customer feedback about how durable and sustainable your packaging really is.

How sequential marketing makes property management more profitable,"<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-to-develop-a-successful-sequential-marketing-plan/"">In previous blogs</a>, we’ve detailed the benefits of sequential marketing. By crafting multi-part content that can be delivered across a variety of devices, advertisers can increase engagement, limit fatigue and significantly increase sales –as demonstrated by the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/news/value-of-storytelling-on-facebook"">Facebook-sponsored study</a>. Consumers move seamlessly across devices, and advertising should follow their cue to be truly effective.

One example of how this works can be seen in the property development sphere. If you are a property developer or a multi-family manager, sequential marketing can help you meet your objectives with greater efficiency.

To better illustrate this, let’s take a look at a hypothetical scenario that outlines how this innovative technology can be used to identify and attract potential renters.

<strong>Using sequential marketing to make property ownership more profitable</strong>

Finding and retaining high-quality tenants is a perennial challenge for property owners and managers. Difficult or slow-to-pay renters can make property ownership less profitable (or perhaps even unprofitable in the worst cases), so effective tenant acquisition is a critical task –and marketing can play a key role in effecting this.

Consider the case of a property owner who has a 500 unit residential development. Occupancy rates have been consistently lower than desired. Additionally, the rate of tenants violating the terms of their leases for non-payment or other issues has been consistently elevated.

To help get occupancy rates up and payment issues resolved the property owner decides a marketing campaign is necessary. Here’s how that scenario may play out.

<strong>A conventional approach</strong>

First, the owner runs a conventional campaign featuring TV ads (expensive, so purchased during off hours to lower costs), advertisements in the local newspaper and some routine <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media marketing</a>. None of it proves effective, so the owner seeks the assistance of a local marketing agency.

The agency informs the property owner that the previous campaign failed because if used a scattershot approach that wasn’t tailored for the right audience. This time, the property development will create a compelling <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story</a> then distribute that message directly into the hands of prospective renters by using sequential marketing.

<strong>Developing a compelling, targeted sequential marketing plan</strong>

Deploying this new strategy, the agency uses <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">data analysis</a> to create ideal buyer personas for the campaign, so the property owner now knows who to target. Content development then gets underway, and the agency crafts a deeply relevant and compelling <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story</a>. In this case, the story is a three-part series of episodes.

The first shows a woman unhappy in her existing apartment; it’s too cramped, the children have to share a room and the furnishings are somewhat dreary.

The second episode shows the woman searching for a new apartment and coming across the property owner’s development, where she receives a walk-through of what could be her new home. She enjoys bright, open spaces.

The concluding sequence of the story shows the woman in her new home, smiling and celebrating a birthday party with her family. The scene fades out and the development’s tagline and contact information are revealed.

<strong>Choosing the most effective distribution points</strong>

After the content is created, this <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story</a> is then delivered across multiple devices in perfect, sequential order to people who have been pre-identified as likely, possible renters.

The end result? The campaign significantly improves occupancy and default rates because it uses sequential marketing to deliver a resonant and deeply relevant marketing message across multiple devices to a target audience. Prospective tenants can be engaged multiple times across a variety of devices without inducing fatigue.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

If you’re a property developer or manager dealing with tenant acquisition challenges – or you simply aren’t getting sufficient ROI on your current marketing approach – consider the power of sequential marketing for your next campaign.

The above example represents just one way this highly effective technique can be deployed to pique renter interest and secure new tenants. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact our digital marketing gurus</a> for more information on how to merge sequential marketing into your business plan.",,6/1/2018 16:51,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/How-sequential-marketing-makes-property-management-more-profitable.jpg,how-sequential-marketing-makes-property-management-profitable,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0

And it didn’t cost them a single media dollar.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inbound marketing gives your PPC and ad budget a break by attracting pre-qualified leads through stellar, well-positioned content -- think highly informative blog posts, video, social media, e-books, infographics, and podcasts. These leads are then converted into sales (and repeat customers) through marketing and re-engagement tools such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing campaigns</a> and targeted ads or promotions. </span></p>

<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Use blogging as the foundation of your inbound marketing strategy </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let’s start with the facts. According to a study by <a href=""http://www.techclient.com/blogging-statistics/""><span class=""s2"">TechClient</span></a>, blogs typically increase a website’s indexed pages -- a critical factor in SEO ranking -- by over 400%, and brands that invest in blogging activities are 13 times more likely to see a positive ROI on their content marketing spends, according to <a href=""http://www.stateofinbound.com/?__hstc=191390709.cb04bd42fd68d1feded1c65dffc30492.1528141104008.1528141104008.1528141104008.1&amp;__hssc=191390709.1.1528141104008&amp;__hsfp=1877505511""><span class=""s2"">Hubspot</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you haven’t started your inbound marketing strategy yet, blogging is the place to begin. Blogs give your team an opportunity to establish itself as an industry thought leader and provide support for the greater internet community. Blogging is also one of the most shareable forms of content, making it a great stepping stone to build your inbound social media presence. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Podcasts are one of the most effective inbound techniques available</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Although hosting a dedicated podcast may be too much work for your organization, seek opportunities to appear as a guest expert or host on popular shows<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/""> related to your audience</a>. As an example, if your brand sells kitchen appliances, consider appearing on popular cooking for foodie podcasts. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Podcasts are a surprisingly effective form of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">inbound marketing</a> because nearly 50% of podcasters listen at home, rather than in their cars, according to <a href=""https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/""><span class=""s2"">Podcast Insights</span></a>. This means they are able to access their phones or computers to follow up on what they learn about your brand and expertise while the moment is fresh. Additionally, over 80% of people also listen to the podcasts in their entirety, including ads and closing remarks suggesting that the average listener is focused and primed to learn and act on what they hear. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Bring inbound market strategy to life through video </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While blogs, articles, and podcasts establish your leaders as industry experts, amazing video content creates an emotional link to your brand. Become a brand that people love, want to talk about, and are proud to promote (or purchase from) through<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/""> good storytelling</a> that reveals how your products are transforming lives or even the world.

5 Conversion marketing tips & tricks to turn prospects into sales,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Once a prospective customer reaches the top of your marketing funnel, they may need a gentle nudge to complete their sale. Facilitate this process by reducing friction across your shopping platforms and by creating a seamless marketing experience that is as inviting as it is enticing by using these proven <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-insight-agency/"">conversion</a> marketing tips and tricks</span></p>
<strong><span class=""s1"">1. </span></strong><strong><span class=""s1"">Keep messaging consistent across platforms</span></strong>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">One of the quickest ways to lose a prospective sale is through a disjointed marketing experience that is confusing or jarring. Invest time in creating a consistent, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel conversion marketing strategy</a> that accurately reflects your brand wherever your customers find you. If an ad looks and feels a certain way, your website and social media should mirror that tone. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Similarly, if you promote an offer or gated content through one channel, make sure the messaging across your corresponding landing page makes sense and reiterates the promotional style your visitor saw before clicking.</span></p>
<strong>2. Examine your sales cycle</strong>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Gather as much data as you can about how long it takes successful customers to move from prospect to sale. Chart cycle variations between products, with promotions and without, and based on seasonality. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Once you have this data, ask yourself whether there are opportunities to shorten this cycle and convert prospects faster or move prospects through the funnel more effectively. As an example, you may extend or target certain promotions before a holiday season or create “free-mium” products that introduce potential customers to your brand, while enticing them to buy with premium, paid upgrades.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">3. Don’t underestimate the importance of remarketing campaigns</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">We firmly believe the saying that when salespeople hear “no” it automatically translates to “not now.”<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>According to <a href=""https://www.invespcro.com/blog/ad-retargeting-2/""><span class=""s2"">InvesP</span></a>, the average click-through rate on PPC campaigns is only 0.07%, while click-through rates on retarget ads jump to 0.7 percent.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">The trick to making <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeting</a> effective is to get focused on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">segmented audience</a> lists that have expressed interest in a certain product, offer, or task on your site. If you aren’t sure how to create more granular remarketing lists, <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact""><span class=""s2"">click here</span></a> to learn more about how our team can help.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">4. Personalize your shopping experience</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">In a study by <a href=""https://www.peoplemetrics.com/customer-experience-elearning""><span class=""s2"">PeopleMetrics</span></a>, average Net Promoter Scores (NPS) increased from 37 to 51 out of 100 when prospects were exposed to personalization efforts that led them to believe the brand was going above and beyond for their benefit. Leverage social media to engage directly with your prospects by answering questions, giving shout outs, and addressing service gaps. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">These efforts combined with carefully retargeted ad campaigns can dramatically differentiate your brand and create an instant human bond that makes people want to complete their sale.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>5. Conversion marketing starts with great content</strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">More leads mean more people are viewing your brand. And more people viewing your brand gives you more opportunities to turn a prospect into a sale. Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> to help prospects discover your brand or reinforce what sets you apart from the competition. Always couple your inbound marketing campaigns with robust paid ads that ensure prospects have a connection to your brand no matter what platform they are browsing or where they are in the customer lifecycle. </span></p>

3 Crucial video marketing strategy tips you probably didn’t know,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Video is one of the most ubiquitous marketing tools available. YouTube users watch over <a href=""https://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-video-marketing-statistics""><span class=""s2"">500 million hours</span></a> of video and over<a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2017/09/22/top-10-video-marketing-trends-and-statistics-roundup-2017/#608cd5c67103'""><span class=""s2""> half a billion people</span></a> watch videos on Facebook each day. This broad reach makes your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">video marketing strategy</a> critically important when driving top-of-funnel awareness and keeping loyal customers connected to your brand. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We know that<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/""> video marketing</a> can be a daunting prospect, so our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/""><span class=""s2"">video team</span></a> has compiled three foundational principles that will help guide your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/"">strategy</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Use your video marketing strategy to tell a story</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Last year, the most watched video ads were from Samsung India’s customer service team and app-based gaming company Clash Roayle, with <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/creativity/the-10-most-watched-ads-on-youtube-in-2017/""><span class=""s2"">150.5M and 110.7M views</span></a> respectively. Neither ad spends time discussing price or features. They simply <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">tell compelling stories</a>. While this isn’t to say that educating your customers or taking them behind the scenes isn’t valuable, these statistics support growing evidence that consumers don’t respond as well to “hard sales pitches” as they do to emotionally engaging content. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Infuse your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video marketing strategy</a> with strong story narratives to set yourself apart in saturated or mature markets where your competitors have similar feature sets and pricing margins. By sharing unique customer stories or communicating something meaningful about your brand values, you can appeal to customers in a way that transcends ever-changing price and feature wars. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Know which channel your video is intended for</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There is no one-size-fits-all channel strategy. Facebook ads are known for their viral, often educational or humorous content, while Instagram ads are usually silent, dreamy appeals. YouTube is the single biggest video-based search platform in the world, while a brand’s Snapchat account can offer a raw, unfiltered look into their values and products. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Although a single concept or storyline may be appropriate for all of these channels, the video itself should be edited to fit the tone, average length, and style of the channel where it will appear. If you aren’t an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">editing expert</a>, don’t worry! Click <a href=""http://www.bigeeyeagency.com/contact""><span class=""s2"">here</span></a> to learn more about how our team can help you storyboard and script, manage talent, stitch together and refine your videos to fit perfectly — wherever and whenever your audience needs to find them. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Introductions and endings are important </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your videos should always be bookended by an attention-grabbing introduction and a concise ending that features a clear call to action (CTA). The average person spends less than 5 seconds deciding whether a video is worth watching, so the first three seconds should provide viewers with an emotional hook or value proposition to keep watching. The meat of your video needs to keep viewers engaged while reinforcing important information about your product or brand, then signal when your viewers should start paying attention to contact details such as your URL or a special offer that will take them to your app or website.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The goal of any video is not to keep them there, but encourage viewers to transition to a platform where they can learn more and make purchases. Make sure your CTA is short and sweet so viewers don’t have a difficult time remembering the exact details to make that jump. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When leveraged properly, video can be a powerful appeal to new and existing customers that highlights what makes your company unique and special.

Color theory’s critical – but often hidden - role in marketing,"If you haven't thought deeply about the relationship between color and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">branding</a>, a quick look around any retail environment will be an eye-opener. Consider the rich red tones used by Coca-Cola, the warm pink hues of Victoria's Secret, or the bold green colors used by BP.

Color theory within the context of advertising and marketing plays a key -- but not always obvious -- role in how consumers perceive and understand these brands. Before we begin to process a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">marketing message (</a>whether through advertising or by viewing a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">simple logo</a>), we first experience the color in which that message is embedded. How we relate to that particular color often sets the tone for everything that follows.

<strong>Using color to connect with audiences</strong>

Satyendra Singh, an academic researcher at the University of Winnipeg, published <u>results from a study </u>that showed two very interesting things. First, people make up their minds about brands or other people within 90 seconds of meeting them. Second, between 62 and 90-percent of this assessment is based on color. The choice of color plays an instrumental role in influencing moods and feelings -- and ultimately attitudes.

Given this importance, a strong grasp of color theory can help support marketing efforts by making messages more resonant and powerful. Choosing the appropriate primary colors, secondary colors and tertiary colors can also make messages <u>much more readable</u> and help with comprehension. By failing to grasp the importance of color, the effectiveness of messages can be significantly diminished.

&nbsp;

With that in mind, here are some key things to understand before choosing your own color schemes:
<ul>
 	<li>If you're looking to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">maximize conversions</a> (and who isn't?) choose bold and bright primary colors. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">Primary colors,</a> such as blue and red, are those which can't be created by the combination of other colors. Darker colors typically have lower conversion rates.</li>
 	<li>Consider the benefits of blue. Look around at corporate marketing and branding and you'll see that no color is as popular as blue. Facebook, IBM, American Express -- the list of prominent firms that use blue is a long one. In fact, <u>51-percent of Fortune 500 logos </u>contain some shade of blue.</li>
 	<li>Choose simplicity over complexity. <u>82-percent </u>of Fortune 500 firms use two or fewer colors in their logo. By keeping your color scheme simple, you encourage <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">immediate brand identification</a> (Coca-Cola and red, Facebook and blue, etc.).</li>
 	<li>Red delivers a message of energy. Blue evokes feelings of trust and placidity. Green generates feelings of naturalness. Orange and purple are ""fun"" colors. Black suggests luxury. If you understand the specific feelings and mood each color evokes, you'll be on your way toward successfully applying color theory in your advertising and marketing.</li>
</ul>

Why you need a multi-family marketing agency to transform your brand,"Over the past decade, 9 million households have entered the renters’ market, catapulting the property management business into a $73 billion dollar industry according to <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/omribarzilay/2017/03/14/property-management-may-be-the-next-frontier-for-ai/#393180bb6fb3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Forbes</a>. The good news is that you don’t need a multi-billion dollar budget to get in on the action. A single-family or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-family marketing agency</a> can help small- and medium-sized property managers scale to compete with large, industry leaders to capture a share of this market.

&nbsp;

<strong>Use a multi-family marketing agency to capture the Millennial market </strong>

The <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-do-small-multifamily-properties-bedevil-us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">American Housing Survey</a> found that rentals comprise nearly 40% of the housing market — a figure that is expected to increase over the next few years as rent-savvy Millennials continue replacing older homeowners. Appealing to this growing audience can be challenging for small- and medium-sized management firms because Millennials expect instant gratification and a highly-personalized rental experience. Because many Millennials are choosing multi-family residences, such as apartment and condo complexes, that offer white-glove service and amenities, enlisting the support of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-family marketing agency</a> can help you anticipate and meet their unique expectations.

A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a> can help you understand how Millennials are searching and ensure your content seamlessly reaches them <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">across channels</a>. Here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>, we pride ourselves on forecasting when and where generational audiences will engage brands across various devices or platforms to help brands plan and spend more efficiently. Learn more about how this philosophy can help catch the attention of Millennials <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/#millennials"">here</a>.

&nbsp;

<strong>Improve search ability by growing your content marketing</strong>

Become an authority on your area, provide curated neighborhood recommendations, and share forecasts about the housing market to entice interested renters. By establishing a helpful, informative <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">digital presence</a>, your property management company will stand out from competition who is leading with hard sales tactics.

Creating blog and social media posts, videos, infographics, and white pages all take time and energy and growing property management companies may not have the resources to spend on this important work if it detracts from their day to day work of maintaining units and buildings relationships with clients and community partners.

A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-family marketing agency</a> that understands the condo market can quickly and cost-effectively pump out and place critical content so your firm can get the exposure it needs without sacrificing precious man-hours.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Help lessees find you by polishing your local listings and presence</strong>

If you’re in real estate, you know it’s all about the listing. And we don’t just mean property listing (although that’s important too). Make sure your property management company is included on all your local listing sites, such as the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary International and other civic-social organizations, Google Places, Yelp, and any organizations that have influence within your area. A multi-family marketing agency will make sure your listings are up-to-date, in compliance with any changing site rules, and performing well against the competition through ongoing optimization efforts.

While this process is not difficult, it can be time consuming — especially if you want to provide an extra level of service by replying to reviews, inquiries, and comments generated on those sites. Because agencies are used to performing this work and have the tools to bulk schedule in advance, it’s usually more expeditious for them to do it than for your team to purchase and learn what is necessary to achieve the same results.

The only guide you & your content marketing agency should use,"Faced with an ever changing landscape of marketing trends, keeping your content fresh can feel like a daunting task. We’ve seen many brands reach out to a top Florida advertising agency when they hit a breaking point and their content has become unmanageable, but we want to share an effective how-to guide that will make your (and your content <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing agency’s</a>) life much easier. By following these simple steps, you can keep your content fresh … without the stress.

&nbsp;

<strong>1. Create a foundation of evergreen content</strong>

While current news, timely statistics, and cutting-edge trends all have a place in your arsenal of content, evergreen material that never goes out of style or “ages” should be the foundation of your digital footprint. This content should anchor your search strategy with keywords that will always be relevant to your brand.

Many companies shy away from creating evergreen content in fear that all the related, popular topics have already been covered. Even if that were true, you can leverage your team’s unique voice or expertise to add a brand-specific spin that will freshen up timeless topics. Your brand should also consider <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">developing content for secondary</a>, or long-tail, topics and keywords that will still drive site traffic, but have less competition against them

&nbsp;

<strong>2. Repurpose your best material</strong>

Partner with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> or use a search tracking tool such as <a href=""https://ahrefs.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ahrefs</a> to monitor how your content is performing in search. If you see a certain keyword ranking drop, it’s time to refresh your material on that topic. Repurpose your best features by punctuating evergreen content with links to news or new statistics. In addition to strengthening your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand’s position</a> on a certain topic, this also helps build backlinks within your site, establishing your credibility in the search ecosystem and bolstering your ranking.

Remember, you aren’t the only person speaking about a certain topic, so just because you’ve said it once, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t revisit the topic with relevant updates  for your ever-growing audience.

&nbsp;

<strong>3. Let your content marketing agency spice up your content type</strong>

You may also want to republish popular topics in a new format. While you may be great at writing blog posts, that same content could capture a different audience if it were translated into an infographic, how-to guide, or formal whitepage.

<strong> </strong>Most people gravitate toward the type of content they create best, so we recommend using a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital agency</a> to help break out of your routine and reframe pieces into new formats. Learn more about how our team can translate content into new and engaging styles <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">here</a>.

&nbsp;

<strong>4. Don’t forget about User Generated Content (UGC)</strong>

If you have awesome followers and influencers engaging with your brand, let them shine. Share and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">promote your users’ good content</a>. Contributors love to be recognized and will probably consider being featured on your social media, blog, or page as a tremendous compliment. UGC also has the added benefit of generating over four times the clickthrough rate of brand content according to <a href=""https://www.shopify.com/blog/68976197-4-tactics-to-drive-traffic-and-sales-with-user-generated-content"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Shopify</a>, so you can’t go wrong.

An influencer marketing agency truly brings value to your brand,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Everyone wants a mega-celebrity such as Selena Gomez, Beyonce, and Cristiano Ronaldo (all of whom boast over 100 million Instagram followers) to promote their brand. But ask any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer marketing agency</a>, and they’ll all tell you that real power comes from partnering with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">micro-influencers</a>. While big names sound exciting and flashy, micro-influencers with authentic, highly-engaged audiences can radically drive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">brand engagement</a> for a fraction of the price. </span></p>
&nbsp;

<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Sure, they have a lot of followers, but major celebrities don’t have as much time to engage with growing brands for advertisement purposes.

<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN""> </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Get more bang for your buck </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">A good influencer marketing agency like </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""http://www.bigeye.com/services"">BIGEYE</a></span><span lang=""EN"">, will advise you to spend as few marketing dollars as possible to get maximum output. On average, micro-influencers are 6.7 times more cost-efficient per click when compared with even relatively unknown celebrities. This figure obviously jumps dramatically depending on how much you pay an influencer to promote your brand. On average, a celebrity makes between </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/celebs-are-paid-2500-8000-per-sponsored-tweet/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">$2,000 and $8,000</a> </span><span lang=""EN"">per branded social media post, compared with some micro-influencers who will gladly promote your brand for free if you let them try it and engage with them. </span></p>

Instagram users with fewer than 1,000 followers generate likes 8% of the time, while users with 1-10 million followers earn likes only 1.7% of the time, with a wide range of decreasing percentages as the audience grows. This makes sense because micro-influencers target a more focused audience actively participating in a niche topic. Think: your local, celebrity yoga instructor whose class you attend every Saturday versus a large-scale yoga clothing brand such as </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.aloyoga.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Alo Yoga</a></span><span lang=""EN"">.</span></p>

4 steps you need to take to nail your brand positioning this year,"A staggering <a href=""https://www.bopdesign.com/bop-blog/2015/10/15-crazy-branding-stats/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">64% of consumers</a> cite shared values as a reason to choose or stay with a brand, which is why clear and effective<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/""> brand positioning</a> can make or break your organization’s success. Whether you have a strong position within the marketplace, or are a budding entrepreneur building your brand, these four steps will help you nail your brand positioning as you grow.

<strong>1. Understand where you’re at today</strong>

Partner with a top Florida marketing agency like <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">BIGEYE</a> to audit your digital presence and tell you what’s working and where you can improve. Chances are, how you think you’re positioning yourself may not be as clear to<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/""> your target audience</a> as you think. Getting a fresh, outside perspective will allow you to step back and objectively confirm how you want to be seen is how your brand is being perceived.

<strong>2. Know your audience </strong>

Start by creating a mission and vision statement as part of your brand foundation that clarifies <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">who your audience is</a> and what you want to help them achieve. Clearly define how your product provides value and stands out from the competition. Next, set short and long term goals that track your customers’ responses -- not just your bottom line. Target specific success criteria such as NPS, engagement, or repeat customers to ensure your brand is resonating with your audience.

<strong>3. </strong><strong>Learn everything you can about your competition</strong>

Identify direct and indirect competitors, then map out their strengths and weaknesses. Think beyond your obvious competition to draw inspiration from related industries and success stories. As an example, an all-inclusive resort might look to similarly priced AirBnB properties, hotels, other all-inclusives, or cruise lines as each of those alternatives offers overlapping features and benefits that the all-inclusive resort hopes to use when engaging their ideal customers. And remember: you can learn something from even your least successful competitor.

<strong>4. Create your value-based positioning strategy </strong>

Once you know what you’re trying to achieve and for whom, you can start <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">implementing a strategy</a> that will help you achieve your goal. Use your mission and vision statement to create a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel</a> marketing strategy that exposes your brand to your audience at every stage in the customer journey. A holistic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a> statement can help you ensure your messaging is consistent across channels and inspires action.

Once you have a strategy in place, you can begin testing what works and refining your brand positioning over time. <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact"">Contact us</a> today to learn more about how we have helped brands like yours refine their identities and make a splash in the marketplace.",,6/29/2018 13:51,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4-steps-you-need-to-take-to-nail-your-brand-positioning-this-year.jpg,4-steps-you-need-to-take-to-nail-your-brand-positioning-this-year,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Why working with a technical college marketing agency is essential,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Over the past decade, the higher education system has changed dramatically. Courses are offered online, highly competitive schools allow students to work full time while pursuing their degrees, technical skills are more valuable than ever, and real-life work experience or work-study programs have become the norm. </span><span lang=""EN""> </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">These changes allow students to become skilled employees faster, while building communities through the talent that fuels their economy. Technical colleges play an important role in this evolution, which is why getting the word out with the help of a technical college <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing agency</a> is so important. <b></b></span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Help students discover important educational alternatives</span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">High school diplomas no longer hold the same weight they used to, and most high school graduates feel pressured to pursue a college degree. The growing expectations that all students will attend college delays skilled employees from entering the workforce and can lead to an unsuccessful college experience for those who are either disinterested or unequipped to participate in a four-year program. According to the </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Institute of Education Statistics</a></span><span lang=""EN"">, 40% of students drop out of four-year degree programs, and 60% of those that do complete their degree take longer than four years to graduate. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Ensuring your technical college is easy to find and learn about empowers students to explore alternatives to a prescriptive college experience. A technical college <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">marketing agency</a> can help your school become more search-friendly by enhancing your<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/""> SEO presence</a> and building a robust <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content strategy</a> that answers your future students’ questions at every stage in the exploration process, on any device, at any time. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Become a building block of your community</span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Technical colleges are no longer a fallback option for high school dropouts. They help talented students who need more scheduling flexibility or more economic education options to get a college degree without strapping themselves with debt. Allowing them to enter the workforce faster and start earning a meaningful wage. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">But don’t take our word for it. The average earnings for a new technical graduate are $55,270 according to the </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics4_611500.htm#17-0000"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span><span lang=""EN"">, which is on par with post other college degrees. Because most technical degrees are two-year programs, enrollment in your school will push skilled labor into the economy faster each year. This creates a dynamic job market for both employers and employees. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">On average, technical colleges are also less expensive than four year programs -- which have </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/this-chart-shows-how-quickly-college-tuition-has-skyrocketed-since-1980-2015-7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">increased 260%</a> </span><span lang=""EN"">in cost over the past decade.  Use a technical college marketing agency like </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">ours</a> </span><span lang=""EN"">to help you build strong relationships between major employers and high schools in your area that will break down outdated stigma about technical colleges.

How a credit union marketing agency can put you one step ahead,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">When most people hear the word “credit union,” they usually don’t rush to their car with enthusiasm for a visit -- yet credit unions and banks are important pillars of commerce, stability, and success in most communities. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN""> </span><span lang=""EN"">Just because credit unions play a highly functional role in most people's day-to-day lives, doesn’t mean your brand can’t speak to your community’s values and become an icon people look forward to engaging with. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">credit union marketing agency</a> can transform your business - and your band - quickly and easily. Here’s how:</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Break outside the box with fresh credit union design ideas</span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">After the 2008 financial crisis, many credit unions and banks struggled to rebuild consumer trust. Using <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media,</a> <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">creative advertising,</a> and generating <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">thought-provoking or helpful blog content</a> can strengthen your customers’ trust. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">As an example, Wells Fargo’s “</span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.ispot.tv/ad/dVfX/wells-fargo-earning-back-your-trust-song-by-black-keys"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Earning Back Your Trust</a></span><span lang=""EN"">” campaign features billboards, YouTube videos, and social media posts all aimed at acknowledging and addressing why their customers stopped trusting them after the<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/crisis-communication-company/""> crisis</a>. Efforts like these humanize your brand and make complicated subject matter more accessible for the average person. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">To strike the right tone for your campaigns to ensure your credit union is still professional and educational while showcasing your human side, partner with a credit union marketing agency like </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">BIGEYE</a> </span><span lang=""EN"">to create unbeatable content. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Freshen up your user experience with new content </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Partner with an agency to take a quick pulse check on your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-analytics-agency/"">website</a> and highlight low word count or low-traffic site pages. Once you’ve identified these weak areas, decide whether content could be combined into another page or expanded upon. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">As a rule of thumb, most pages should have 1,000 (or more) words to ensure each digital touchpoint is meaty and meaningful for visitors. This deep content also signals to<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/""> search engines</a> that your brand is an authoritative voice in the space and that it should be ranked higher in search results.</span><span lang=""EN""> </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Provide valuable services online</span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">This last recommendation may be a little more difficult to implement, but worth the effort. Whether you use a website or app to accomplish this goal, make sure your customers can perform some services online without visiting your brick and mortar location. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">For new or lapsed customers, this is a way to entice them to choose or return to your brand. Once you have them hooked, they will keep coming back for your services. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">While it may be unrealistic for your credit union to adopt </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""http://www.bankofamerica.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bank of America</a></span><span lang=""EN"">’s complete digital banking style, a top <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Florida marketing agency</a> can help you determine what services you can provide that will be of value to your customers and then successfully market those within your community. </span><span lang=""EN""> </span></p>

Decoding a hidden world by using a pharmaceutical naming agency,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">When is the last time you heard someone ask a pharmacist for a refill on </span><span lang=""EN"">N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-[4- (trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]propan-1-amine? How about fluoxetine? The answer is probably more common than you think. While the scientific and generic names for Prozac aren’t particularly memorable, they do provide a revealing look into the byzantine world of pharmaceutical naming. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Many small and medium pharmaceutical <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/primary-secondary-market-research/"">researchers</a> and producers don’t realize how important naming is until the FDA rejects their patent and sends years of research and clinical trials back to square one. A pharmaceutical naming agency can help decode the mystery and ensure your work makes it to market. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Why pharmaceutical naming matters </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">The FDA strictly regulates and subsequently rejects </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/health/art-of-drug-naming/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">between 20 - 25%</a> </span><span lang=""EN"">of drugs’ generic and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand names</a> to avoid confusion that might lead to misdosing, confusion over a drug’s efficacy, or that might lead to patient stigmatization and privacy violations. Once approved, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">the naming process</a> continues to play an important role in a drug’s success because a pharmaceutical company may only market their drug under a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand name</a>, rather than a generic or scientific name, once it has been </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/brand-name-and-generic-drugs/overview-of-generic-drugs-and-drug-naming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">patent protected</a></span><span lang=""EN"">. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Competing companies may market the same generic drug under a different name to make the market more competitive. While Advil and Motrin are both <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand names</a> for ibuprofen, their name, positioning, and marketing plays an important role in which the consumer ultimately chooses. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">How a pharmaceutical naming agency can boost your success</span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">The average pharmaceutical naming agency creates between 2,000 - 5,000 names for each drug before beginning the FDA screening process and march to patent protection that will allow brands to compete in the market. A top Florida advertising agency like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a></span><span lang=""EN""> </span><span lang=""EN"">can help kick off that process by vetting names that may raise flags for the FDA or that will not stand out from the competition. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">By partnering with a creative team, your brand can focus on the science and success of your product while your agency <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">ensures your research</a> and work does not get delayed because its name sounds too similar to another drug or accidentally includes the common shorthand for another scientific component. </span></p>

3 Ways to boost occupancy rate using property management marketing,"Good property management marketing can bring ideal tenants to your properties easily and effectively. Instead of competing on price or square footage, a well placed ad from a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying agency</a> or curated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media</a> posts can bring your community, neighborhood, and units to life.

Help prospective tenants discover and choose your property with three of the best kept secrets every multi-family marketing and property management firm needs to start using today.

<strong>1. Invest in a responsive, mobile-friendly site</strong>

According to <a href=""https://www.godigitalmarketing.com/learn/blog/6-apartment-marketing-ideas-every-property-manager-should-know"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GogoDigital</a>, 98% of renters use mobile devices on a weekly basis to power their apartment search. Of them, nearly half said they would opt out of a property or unit if the site didn’t work effectively on their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/responsive-web-design-company/"">cell phone or tablet</a>. Work with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing agency </a>like <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">BIGEYE</a> to ensure your website works across devices and creates a seamless experience between all your channels such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media,</a> advertising, and email.

This simple update lets prospective renters know you operate a trustworthy, modern business. This is especially important as more and more renters expect to conduct the leasing process online using virtual signing tools to execute their leases and 360 digital tours to screen properties and make their final decisions.

<strong>2. Content is king and search engine optimization is queen</strong>

The best property <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">management marketing site</a> in the world needs to be search-friendly in order for your business to thrive. Prospective residents often start their apartment hunt on search engines, either to discover and explore properties, or to find companies that can assist with the leasing process.

Understanding what your specific goals are (think: promoting your property managed community versus offering a white-glove realtor service) will help you create engaging content that catches prospective residents’ attention and boosts your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">ranking</a> in Google and other search engines.

<strong>3. Demonstrate your authenticity through social media and community engagement</strong>

Put words into action by reinforcing the values your property management marketing efforts are promoting by creating an authentic <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media presence</a> and participating in community events that are aligned to your ideal residents’ needs.

As an example, if your brand focuses on LEED certification and eco-conscious buildings, you may want to co-sponsor a beach clean up near your property to demonstrate your commitment and make like-minded individuals aware of your units. If you aren’t sure where to start, a local, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">top Florida advertising agency</a> can point you in the right direction to build partnerships and activate events via social media.

Creative advertising marketing strategies for your company's Christmas in July,"The holiday season is a make or break time for many businesses. Last year, overall spending during the months of November and December was <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/22/last-retailers-see-big-boost-sales-holiday-season/976599001/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">roughly 10-percent higher </a>than the rest of the year. If your business doesn't flourish during these high spending months, it faces a significant competitive disadvantage during the rest of the year. All of which makes being prepared with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/"">creative marketing strategies</a> that much more important for your brand.

The best <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketers</a> understand that it takes months of work to fully prepare for the holiday season. By taking a ""Christmas is July"" approach, you can help ensure that no opportunity goes unexplored during the hectic holiday months.

With that in mind, let's take a closer look at some creative marketing strategies you can begin implementing now to help prepare for the important months ahead.

<strong>Digital marketing</strong>

In digital marketing -- as in just about everything else -- preparation is closely tied to performance. So, what are some of the things marketers can start doing now to get ready for the critical holiday months? Consider the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Keyword and ideation preparation. It's never too soon to start generating compelling Christmas content ideas. It's not unusual to see a lot of derivative, shallow, or evergreen seasonal content published during this period, as agencies and businesses are often shorthanded or dealing with other pressing concerns. This presents marketers with an excellent opportunity to stand out from the fray by offering truly compelling holiday marketing that breaks the usual mold.</li>
 	<li>Select<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/""> target</a> and landing pages. You might be able to save time by replicating last year's pages, assuming there isn't too much difference in terms of keywords and other variables. Add fresh holiday content to your pages.</li>
 	<li>Refine your mobile strategy. Now is the time to figure out which messages or ideas resonate the most. Sharpen your focus by employing data analysis to learn what your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">customers are searching for</a>.</li>
 	<li>Keep an eye on what your competitors are doing.</li>
 	<li>As July rolls into August, begin the process of creating new content for the holiday season. Define and optimize high-value holiday target pages.</li>
 	<li>Finally, begin social media marketing and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">outreach campaigns.</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>The importance of partnering with the right agency</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">Creative resort advertising</a> strategies play a critical role in holiday season business success. The best digital marketing agencies understand this, and prepare accordingly by taking a ""Christmas in July"" approach.

Why preparing your Christmas marketing strategy in July is imperative,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">The holiday season is of great importance to just about every retailer. In fact, it often makes the difference between a profitable year and one that falls short of expectations.</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">The raw numbers illustrate the scope of the opportunity: In 2017, U.S. retailers <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/26/u-s-retail-holiday-sales-jump-4-9-biggest-increase-since-2011/981464001/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">reported their largest </a>holiday sales increase since 2011 -- 4.9-percent. In total, U.S. consumers spent roughly $680 million during the holiday period. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">To ensure that your business receives a sizable slice of that pie, it's imperative to get an early jump on your Christmas <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy</a> and efforts. In fact, the most successful firms take a ""Christmas in July"" approach to seasonal marketing.</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Prepping your Christmas marketing strategy five months early</span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">The pre-holiday duties for retail marketing are as vast as they are important -- holiday decorations, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">outdoor marketing</a>, merchandise layout designs, the designation of door busters and loss leaders. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">The key to success in all these activities is simple: Allowing your business sufficient lead time to hit the holiday season running, armed with fully-realized visions and thoroughly-tested tactics.</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Mobile marketing</a> presents one good example: The rise of mobile has had extraordinary impact on how consumers navigate the process of shopping. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Today's consumers use their mobile devices to check and compare prices, purchase items, redeem coupons, etc. Just as importantly, these coupons (and other promotional messages) are seamlessly delivered via mobile device.</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Even if your customers don't redeem a particular offer or engage with a promotion, you can still glean key business intelligence by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">analyzing their behavior</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Metrics such as the number and type of messages opened, the time spent engaging with each message, and amount of social sharing can all offer a window into consumer wants and needs.</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">To get the full advantage of this kind of data, it's important to start engaging early. If a business begins running A/B testing in July to determine which kind of Christmas <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing strategy</a> works best, they can enter the all-important holiday season armed with the most relevant and engaging content to share with customers.</span></p>

Tips to jumpstarting your business' holiday marketing efforts,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Most businesses want nothing more for the holidays than a successful sales season. Getting an early jump on holiday marketing efforts is one of the best ways to ensure this happens -- </span><span lang=""EN"">choosing the right <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Orlando marketing agency</a> is part of that process as well.
</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">With that in mind, let's review some key things to know when preparing a Christmas marketing in July.
<b>
</b><strong>Don't wait to start developing relationships</strong></span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Whether you're selling B2B or retail, the holiday season is a whirlwind of activity for your customers. Most of them are swamped with their own work and under siege from the marketing efforts of your competitors.</span></p>
This means that businesses need to start cultivating these relationships earlier -- much earlier. Engage with prospective clients in the early summer months. Build relationships. Get your CRM database up to date and ready to go.

By the time November rolls around, your marketing campaign will be a well-oiled machine.

<strong>Go against the grain</strong>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Sometimes the best holiday marketing approach is the most counterintuitive or unconventional one. Customers have become immune to the same holiday displays, symbols and messages; it's all just background noise. To break through the usual holiday routine, spend July planning a marketing campaign that cuts against the usual grain.</span></p>
REI, the famous outdoor equipment co-op, offered a brilliant example of this kind of holiday marketing a few years ago with its <span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.rei.com/blog/news/optoutside-will-you-go-out-with-us"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">#OptOutside campaign</a>, which was built around REI's decision to close all of its locations on Black Friday. This idea, which ran counter to countless other marketing campaigns celebrating Black Friday, tapped into emerging public displeasure with the corporate-created pseudo holiday.</span>

REI was showered with praise for giving their employees a break from Black Friday chaos -- and also earned just about every major advertising and marketing award for its trouble.

<strong>Take a phased approach</strong>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Every year it's like clockwork -- businesses begin to flood the zone with holiday marketing as soon as Halloween ends. A smarter approach, however, is to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">build your campaigns</a> with a phased implementation in mind.</span></p>
Beginning in July, start developing a narrative that can unfold from the summer until the height of the holiday season. Use distinct stages for your messaging and promotional activity. Make it so your campaign evolves along with the buyer's journey. Pique their interest and build awareness over the summer, then step on the gas in terms of messaging and promotion once you enter the buying season.

<strong>Choosing the right partner</strong>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Whether you're seeking a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying agency</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand messaging company</a>, BIGEYE can provide the experience and expertise to craft an unforgettable holiday marketing campaign.

Chipotle's new menu: How good marketing trumps bad queso,"Chipotle, the famous fast-casual Mexican restaurant, ended years of burrito purism with a recent <u>menu expansion.</u> Along with the usual overstuffed Mission-style burritos, customers can soon order quesadillas, nachos, milkshakes, avocado tostadas, and salads.

Nachos and quesadillas at a Mexican restaurant? <em>And they said innovation was dead</em>.

Now, don't get us wrong -- we love Chipotle. They've been good to us, with those massive burritos providing the necessary fuel for countless meetings and creative work sessions here at <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a>. America may ""run on Dunkin,"" but our little corner of Central Florida runs on barbacoa burritos.

Yet this hasn't always been a smooth relationship. For as much as we love Chipotle, it hasn't always been easy to be a customer.

First, Chipotle was a victim of their own success, driving us crazy with those long cafeteria-style lines. Then the lines miraculously disappeared -- but only because everyone was afraid to eat there following a multi-state <u>outbreak of E. coli </u>at Chipotle restaurants.

After a bit of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/crisis-communication-company/"">crisis marketing</a> (and the consumer's natural tendency to forgive and forget over time) Chipotle began to bounce back -- only to squander their newfound sympathy and goodwill with the disastrous rollout of their long-awaited<u> queso dip</u>. For years, Chipotle's most loyal fans had begged for queso sauce; the product they finally got was <u>a goopy abomination</u> described as ""dumpster juice"" and ""expired Velveeta.""

So, after all of these trials and tribulations, you can understand why the recent menu expansion was received with skepticism in our office. Will Chipotle finally be rewarded with a big win after years of setbacks?

With that said, we have a few ideas about how Chipotle should market the new menu and win back lapsed customers.

<strong>Marketing the new menu and earning trust and loyalty</strong>

As mentioned above, our office is full of Chipotle fans, so we're rooting for the company. Here's our quick take on their situation:
<ul>
 	<li>Food safety isn't the primary reason why sales slumped at Chipotle. Customer surveys showed that <u>long wait lines and messy staging and eating areas </u>have turned off more Chipotle consumers than food safety concerns. We believe Chipotle needs to reassure its customers that new menu items won't translate into interminable wait times -- or any added wait at all. This is a company that needs to put the ""fast"" back into the fast casual concept they helped pioneer.</li>
 	<li>While food safety may not be the primary reason why Chipotle sales have flagged, it still certainly plays a role. The chain has tried numerous tactics for addressing this problem, including the announcement of ""zero tolerance food safety protocols,"" the distribution of free burritos, experiments with drive-ins, and now, a new menu. None of it has been quite enough to completely turn the ship upright.</li>
 	<li>Chipotle's marketing efforts can learn a lesson from Jack in the Box, which faced a far worse E. coli outbreak in the 1990s. Though Jack in the Box introduced many of the same food safety protocols (and slashed prices on its famous tacos) to help lure customers back, it was the 1994 rollout of the wildly successful ""<u>Jack's Back"" advertising campaign </u>that truly revived the company's fortunes. Perhaps, if the new menu isn't enough to reignite interest, Chipotle (a relatively ad averse company) needs to do the same. As our favorite fictional ad man Don Draper once said, ""If you don't like what's being said, change the conversation.""</li>
</ul>
Regardless of how Chipotles marketing approach turns out, once thing is certain: We'll be lining up to try the new quesadillas and nachos -- but we're still not going anywhere near the queso.",,6/28/2018 16:56,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Chipotles-New-Menu_-How-Good-Marketing-Trumps-Bad-Queso.jpg,chipotles-new-menu-how-good-marketing-trumps-bad-queso,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
2018’s Top restaurant marketing tools to bring consumers to your door,"<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Reputation is everything</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">More than in almost any other industry, reputation can make or break a restaurant’s success. Before online platforms such as Yelp, Facebook, and Google+ were common, written reviews from trusted sources, such as the Wall Street Journal’s Food &amp; Wine section or Zagat, were the most accessible way for consumers to glean information about a restaurant. Due to the niche distribution and content constraints of printed reviews, restaurants could be overlooked entirely or not given the credit they deserve. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Today, foodies have an abundance of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital tools</a> to connect directly with each other and share their experiences. This is a wonderful opportunity for restaurants to engage their consumer base and get the word out about their venue. Ask your customers where they look at reviews and incentivize them to share their opinions by offering a free drink or appetizer in exchange.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">More reviews will help normalize your rating and provide insight into where you can improve. And if you think reviews don’t matter: think again. In a recent study, the <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/foodbeast/half-star-difference-yelp_b_1944145.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Huffington Post</span></a> found that a half star difference on Yelp can influence a restaurant’s revenue by 27%. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Make it easy for customers to find you</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Don’t rely on foot traffic to bring guests to your door. More than 97% of diners look online to find local businesses. Of which, 60% cross-reference their restaurant selections with review sites, according to <a href=""https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/local-consumer-review-survey/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">BrightLocal</span></a>. This means, your restaurant needs to carefully orchestrate geo-targeted ads, as well as listings across major local map and review platforms so your customers can easily find you.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Consistency across channels helps your customers make the jump from searching for a place to eat on their tablet, to entering your location into their GPS, and leaving a positive review on their laptop after the meal. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Additionally, a seamless multi-channel presence signals to consumers that you are a reputable business that understands their needs and is able to provide the information they want, when and where they want it.

<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Pictures really are worth 1,000 clicks</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When promoting the quality of your restaurant and food, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">pictures are the easiest way to engage consumers</a>. While an online reviewer may share different tastes or expectations than the reader, a picture provides clear insight into what someone can expect at your venue. We recommend investing in professional photography to showcase your menu and establishment, combined with a curated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/online-reputation-management-agency/"">social media presence</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As an example, Instagram - the quintessential photo sharing platform -<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>is slated to hit over one billion active users in 2018. If you can only pick one platform to invest in, this is your best bet. Over 80% of their users happily engage with brands already according to <a href=""https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">SproutSocial</span></a>, and the photo-centric nature of this platform makes it an ideal place to showcase creative restaurant promotions alongside mouth-watering visual appetizers. </span></p>

Law firm marketing to beat your competition without lifting a finger,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Most legal firms are behind the digital times. Benchmark indicators of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">digital transformation</a>, such as having a responsive, mobile website, or local map listings, are hard to find in the legal world. Because most firms are investing more than <a href=""https://www.imarc.com/blog/2016_legal_marketing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">60% of their marketing dollars</span></a> into buying cold leads, rather than updating their digital presence, implementing these simple steps will help you reach your law firm marketing goals. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a> to generate leads</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One in three consumers uses the internet to search for legal services, so if you invest money into a strong search strategy for lawyer marketing with a goal of a 7:1 return on your investment, you’ll outpace the competition investing in cold leads. <a href=""https://www.marketingforsuccess.com/sales/cold-calling/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Cold leads </span></a>typically convert at 2%, whereas solid leads and referrals convert at 20% and 50% respectively.

<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Use marketing automation to turn leads into clients</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">According to <a href=""http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2016/02/benchmark-law-firm-intake/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Law Technology Today</span></a>, close to half of law firms take more than three days to reply to leads when they reach out. Because most law firm marketing teams don’t have the bandwidth to regularly reply to outreach outside their caseload, creating automated email and marketing templates for interested clients improves service without sacrificing billable hours. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience segmentation</a> to create and serve content that will feel personal, highly-relevant, and specific to each inquiry or type of law you practice.

<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Use social media turns clients into referrals</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As you close cases, encourage your clients to write reviews or post to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a> about your firm. You can share and repurpose this content on social media, across your website, and in email outreach campaigns.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">Understanding who you are talking to</a> is the foundation of strong marketing segmentation. Initiate a relationship with your target audience by acknowledging that you understand who they are, empathize with their needs, and have products and services that can solve their pain points. Start by pulling quantitative information about your site traffic such as socio-economic demographics and referring sources, then layer on the behavioral information you can glean from third-party data outlets such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media</a> and lead forms. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This information will allow you to paint a picture of who your customers are, where they spend their time online, and what they need, so you can use this data to create a flawless marketing experience. Translating this data into actionable insights is the most technically challenging part of the marketing segmentation journey, so we recommend partnering with a trusted <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a> like <span class=""s2"">BIGEYE</span> to get you started. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">When all else fails, ask: Using choice-based marketing segmentation </span></strong></p>

As an example, you may feature a drop-down menu on your landing page that allows visitors to share what industry they are in to receive personalized content or encourage them to opt-in through gated content and lead forms. Once your audience has identified themselves, you can accurately speak to them and provide meaningful content without doing as much upfront audience segmentation work. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Build marketing segmentation campaigns that fit your audience’s needs </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Once you know who you are speaking to, begin creating content that is specific, timely, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">relevant to your audiences</a>. Use marketing segmentation tools such a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeted</a> display ads, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search</a>, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media campaigns</a> to ensure your brand stays top of mind and relevant. While hyper-personalization is important, it’s equally important to recognize that site visitors may flow in and out of different personas and audience types as they move through the customer journey or as their individual needs evolve. Work with an agency to find the right blend of targeted content and universally relevant information or use A/B testing to validate you have the right mix. </span></p>

3 marketing tactics every vocational school needs to start doing today,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">College expenses have increased more than 260% over the past 50 years, according to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/this-chart-shows-how-quickly-college-tuition-has-skyrocketed-since-1980-2015-7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Business Insider</span></a>, making space for vocational schools to shine in the market. As more students opt out of four years (or more) of student loan debt and seek educational opportunities that will help them get highly skilled jobs quicker and more cost-effectively, vocational school marketing is becoming increasingly important. These three tactics are the easiest, most effective way to market a vocational college in today’s high volume school zones. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Invest in valuable content</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Prospective students are interested in what your school can do for them. Rich, detailed content and photography are the best ways to accomplish this goal and market technical college. Use content to make a memorable, inviting first impression that entices students to reach out to your admissions team and begin the enrollment process. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If your site is outdated or you don’t have a budget to hire a full-time content team, work with an agency like <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services""><span class=""s2"">BIGEYE</span></a> to create student personas based on the areas of expertise your school offers. By layering in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">targeted content</a>, blog posts, and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/brand-awareness-studies/"">case studies</a> that will appeal to your ideal candidates, your vocational school will make its mark on the map. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Streamline information</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Once students believe your school is a good fit, they will want to know the facts, such as how flexible scheduling can be, whether online classes are available, what tuition costs look like, whether there are course requirements, and how many accreditations your institution offers. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Vocational school marketing hinges on building trust in your brand, so don’t hide these critical details behind a gated form or require students to call to learn more as this can become a barrier when comparing other schools that show this information. Create easy-to-navigate landing pages and a strong information architecture to signal to students that you have nothing to hide and are a strong option for their future. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Leverage social media</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Over 70% of students use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">social media</a> to research college, and three out of four of them cite it as being “very influential” in their decision to enroll according to the <a href=""http://www.zinch.com/social-admissions-report"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Social Admissions Report</span></a>.<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/""> Social media</a> helps prospects understand what type of students enroll and how they can expect your experience to fit into their lives.

Packaging should protect both your products during transportation and distribution, as well as your reputation. Cheap, misleading, or confusing packaging can lead to customer frustration, resistance taking their medication, or liability issues if dosing is unclear.

<strong>2.Graphic packaging can increase patient adherence</strong>

According to the <a href=""https://www.nacds.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National Association of Chain Drug Stores</a>, only 25-30% of patients take their medication as indicated. Most often, these patients cite confusion over how they were intended to take a drug. Packaging plays an important role in communicating a drug’s indications, benefits, risks, and interactions with other substances and could have the potential to dramatically improve patient adherence.

Graphic packaging and<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/""> infographics</a> are a great way to build knowledge about complicated products or drugs. They also improve clarity for the medication being distributed among low-income demographics where literacy is low.

<strong>3.Flawless packaging doesn’t need to break your budget</strong>

The good news is that high-quality, informative packaging can be achieved on almost any budget by partnering with a specialized graphic packaging agency.

The importance of voice commerce for CPG brands continues to spike,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Voice commerce may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about your CPG brand’s end of year strategy … but it should be. Get ahead of the competition by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">embracing this trend</a> before it’s too late. In case voice commerce is new to you, here are a few statistics showcasing what voice commerce can do for your brand. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Voice commerce is the fastest growing retail channel </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">According to <a href=""https://voicebot.ai/2018/03/05/voice-shopping-reach-40-billion-u-s-5-billion-uk-2022/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">OC&amp;C</a>, voice commerce will represent a $40 billion retail channel by 2022. Despite the prevalence of mobile and e-commerce shopping platforms, consumers cite convenience, speed, and the ability to multitask as reasons why they are beginning to prefer shopping by voice. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Although the most common form of voice commerce is creating shopping lists and checking delivery, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Amazon Echo’s Alexa</a> users are increasing point of sale conversion metrics exponentially. Amazon’s one-click shopping flow and saved payment options make purchasing by voice frictionless and have helped Echo users become comfortable with voice commerce so the trend can expand. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Smart speaker voice commerce outpaces mobile aI assistants </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other smart speaker customers are more likely to shop by voice than those using mobile virtual assistants such as Siri and Cortana. NPR’s <a href=""http://nationalpublicmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Smart-Audio-Report-from-NPR-and-Edison-Research.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Smart Audio Report</a> found that nearly 60% of smart speaker owners have already purchased items using their devices. While another study from <a href=""https://www.retailwire.com/discussion/where-is-the-shopping-opportunity-with-voice-commerce/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Capgemini</a>, indicated that 40% — perhaps the remaining market share — of consumers predict they will be more likely to use voice commerce to make purchases rather than engaging with a retailer’s <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile app</a> or website.</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN""> If your brand can only invest in one <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice commerce</a> platform, we recommend partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">digital marketing agency</a> like ours to create baseline integrations for smart speakers.  </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Smart speaker users also represent higher AOV </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Due to the socioeconomic demographics of smart speaker owners who tend to be wealthier and more tech-savvy, shoppers using Amazon Echo tend more on CPG products than consumers without speakers. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">A consumer <a href=""https://www.alpine.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">report</a> by InfoScout in collaboration with Alpine.ai saw a 29% lift in consumers’ year over year CPG product purchases who had smart speakers, and only a 19% lift in those that did not. While this metric does not show causality, the correlation between speaker owners and higher AOV’s signal digital marketers to begin investing in this trend as a way to access a more desirable customer base. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Voice commerce is critical for standardized CPG products </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Before the end of 2018, 55% of retailers plan to have <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice assistance integrations</a> on their roadmap, 60% plan to have mobile voice search, and 58% plan to have desktop voice search, according to a study by <a href=""https://www.onespace.com/blog/2018/01/new-research-emphasizes-importance-voice-commerce-cpg-brands/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Onespace</a>. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Staying in line or ahead of this digital trend is important for CPG brands, especially those that sell standardized products and have few opportunities to differentiate themselves beyond price and placement within the market. While it may not give you an immediate leg up, no CPG brand can afford to fall behind. </span></p>

4 commerce marketing metrics every B2C digital expert should track,"<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">As big data and robust analytics information becomes more accessible and affordable thanks to platforms such as Google and Adobe Analytics, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">commerce marketing experts</a> are becoming spoiled by choice. With so much information, it can be hard to determine which metrics are most important. To help you cut through the clutter, we recommend tracking these four B2C marketing metrics as the foundation of your true north to provide an insightful benchmark no matter what industry you’re in, or how mature your analytics team is.</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Conversion rate</span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">The single most important metric any business should focus on is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">conversion</a> rate. This KPI is calculated by dividing the number of sales by the number of visitors to your site. Regardless of industry, the </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">average conversion rate</a> </span><span lang=""EN"">on most websites is between one and two percent. This means that even small changes to your conversion rate can have a big impact on your bottom line. Work with your analytics team, or partner with a digital marketing agency like </span><span lang=""EN""><a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/services"">BIGEYE</a> </span><span lang=""EN"">to track the fallout throughout your booking funnel so you can reduce friction and boost this critical KPI. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Average order value (AOV) </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Understanding how much people spend on average when visiting your site will help you unlock information about your customers’ lifetime value and gross margins. This is an easy metric to calculate by referencing your revenue against the number of orders over a given period of time. Once you know your average order value, you can also determine whether your business would make more revenue with fewer, large sales, or have greater success with many small sales. Armed with this information, you can tailor your marketing experience to your customers’ and business’s needs accordingly. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Website traffic </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">While knowing how many people hit your site used to be an important KPI for success, total visitors has grown less popular as more nuanced tagging has become available. Instead of focusing on total traffic (although this figure can provide insight into whether you need to boost your search strategy or advertising dollars), we recommend digging one click deeper into your traffic metrics. Understand how long people are spending on your site, how many p<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">ages people view per visit</a>, and whether you have more unique or returning visitors. These metrics will help inform your content strategy and highlight areas where your information architecture could use support. </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong><span lang=""EN"">Cart abandonment rate </span></strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">Unexpected fees, shipping or services costs, buggy credit card processing, and confusing or cumbersome form fields are just a few of the reasons customers abandon a purchase. Track your cart abandonment rate to understand how your commerce systems are performing and preemptively tackle areas that may be pain points to your visitors. Regardless of how high your cart abandonment rate is today, it’s one of the easiest metrics to improve by streamlining the checkout process. </span><span lang=""EN""> </span></p>
<p class=""normal""><span lang=""EN"">These four metrics are the anchors for every analytics strategy. So the next time you find yourself pondering, “what is commerce marketing,” or “how can I harness site data for my B2C marketing strategy,” come back to these KPIs.

3 Tools every brand strategy agency uses to increase conversion,"A strong <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy</a> agency knows there are a few tried and tested tools that will boost conversions across every industry. At <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">BIGEYE</a>, we pride ourselves on championing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing</a> so our clients can meet their customers’ needs on any device, across any platform, and raise the collective benchmark for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a> best practices. These are the three tools we use to help our clients transform their  brand within months - guaranteed.

<strong>1. Segmentation is more important than ever</strong>

While content is still king, a one-size fits all model will quickly overthrow the throne. Partner with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy agency l</a>ike <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">BIGEYE</a> to fully <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">understand your audience</a> and the different segments shopping for your products. Create<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/""> custom content</a> for each segment and use tokenization, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">analytics tagging</a>, social sign on, or self-identification to recognize and adapt to your site visitors by serving them content relevant to their needs. This will increase customer loyalty and boost the likelihood for conversion. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">Segmentation</a> will also help you understand what types of customers are most valuable so you can budget your marketing dollars around their potential.

<strong>2.Invest in omni-channel marketing</strong>

It is rare for a customer to enter the marketing funnel and complete a conversion in the same visit, or on the same device. Investing in an omni-channel marketing strategy allows you to anticipate the natural jump your visitors will make between devices and across channels throughout their customer journey.

In addition to anticipating your customers’ needs and increasing the likelihood of being able to serve compelling content,<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/""> retarget,</a> and ultimately convert your site traffic, omni-channel customer engagement also boosts retention, which can increase your lifetime value and returning site traffic. According to <a href=""http://www.invespcro.com/blog/state-of-omnichannel-shopping/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Invesp</a>, brands with omni-channel engagement retrain 89% of their customers compared to 33% for companies who do not invest in this strategy.

<strong>3.Don’t make assumptions about your competition or your customers</strong>

When clients ask us why a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy agency</a> will help them succeed, we often highlight assumptions they may be making about their competitions or their customers. It’s natural for product and brand leaders to make assumptions based on their own experience using their products day by day. Having a fresh pair of eyes set up the a/b testing, seek answers, and translate data into actionable insights is one of the most valuable outputs of working with an agency.

Why smart marketers are allocating ad spend to OTT media,"If a person from the year 2005 were to visit us today, they'd find that most things in our daily lives hadn't changed dramatically over 13 years.

Until they decided to watch a film or a television show, of course. Then they'd realize the way people consume content has been radically altered in a brief span of time.

In 2005, you didn't watch a movie <em>on </em>Netflix -- you watched a movie <em>from </em>Netflix (and only after waiting two days for it to arrive in the mail). If you wanted to watch your favorite TV show, you had to view it live or record it. Hulu didn't exist, and the very idea of video-on-demand was in its infancy.

Now, just a bit more than a decade later, a video store is all but extinct. The idea of a snail-mailed subscription DVD service seems quaint and faintly ridiculous. We watch what we want, when we want, on the device we want.

In other words, we watch Over-the-Top (OTT) media -- and that's something with profound implications for marketers.

<strong>Cable vs. OTT</strong>

Over-the-Top is a term to describe the process by which content is streamed directly to consumers over the Internet by media services. Much like cable technology revolutionized broadcast media by greatly expanding the viewing choices available to consumers, OTT media has transformed modern viewing habits.

Instead of the need for a conventional cable or satellite over the top box, OTT media streams directly to the viewer, bypassing television and telecommunication platforms that have historically acted as distributors of video content. Today's most popular forms of OTT media include subscription-based services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Video.

In addition to offering content created by TV networks and film studios, these OTT platforms also create significant amounts of original material, making them full-fledged competitors to traditional content creators and distributors.

<strong>Why OTT media is critical for today's marketers and advertisers </strong>

This profound change in viewing habits, content creation, and distribution models hasn't gone unnoticed by marketers and advertisers. Today, eight-in-ten U.S. homes have an OTT subscription, according to a PwC study, while <a href=""https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/tmt/media/outlook/segment-findings.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/tmt/media/outlook/segment-findings.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1534001302671000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZ6kN_Dq098crNIYeS44Cl0bjCgw"">emerging markets are embracing OTT </a>at an even faster rate. Additionally, Ericsson projects that 75% of all mobile traffic will be <a href=""https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/study-video-will-climb-to-75-of-all-mobile-traffic-by-2023/512168/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/study-video-will-climb-to-75-of-all-mobile-traffic-by-2023/512168/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1534001302671000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZZVw22w3GJ8GqlnFPG9a2bUs2LQ"">dedicated to video streaming by 2023</a>.

OTT media is particularly popular with younger people, who subscribe to OTT services at even higher rates than the general public. As society grows younger and more tech-oriented, marketers are changing their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">media buying habits</a> and designing campaigns optimized for OTT.

In years past, marketers were hamstrung by single screens and a limited pool of content. Today, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content</a> is available on multiple devices and programming options have never been greater.

OTT media platforms have led the way in using data analytics to accurately gauge what their viewers are interested in seeing. This has resulted in a proliferation of new films and series that are focused on niche audiences who have been historically underrepresented on broadcast networks and cable. Because this content is targeted and deeply relevant, viewers tend to be hyper-engaged -- music to the ears of marketers and advertisers.

The OTT model also allows for more control of how and where ad content is displayed, and how ROI is tracked -- all key considerations for a multi-platform campaign.

<strong>How multi-platform campaigns can derive maximum benefits from OTT media</strong>

Recently there have been studies undertaken to gauge the effectiveness of multi-platform OTT advertising. The results are compelling: According to <a href=""https://www.hulu.com/advertising/the-role-of-ott-in-a-cross-platform-video-campaign/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.hulu.com/advertising/the-role-of-ott-in-a-cross-platform-video-campaign/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1534001302671000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQPz9ZeTnHy1q8CF42w3m9fhrMAQ"">a joint study</a> by market research firm Kantar Millward Brown and Hulu, OTT significantly outperformed in terms of ad performance.

In cross-platform testing, OTT and mobile were the most successful in terms of reaching key ad objectives. Overall, among PC, mobile and OTT distribution, OTT ranked highest in aided awareness and brand favorability, while mobile ranked highest in purchase intent.

OTT also plays an important role in preventing potential ad fatigue generated by a multi-platform campaign with high ad frequency. The aforementioned study showed little to no decline in an ad's effectiveness even after up to nine OTT media exposures.

Ultimately, the case for greater OTT focus in a multi-platform campaign comes down to a few key factors. First, advertisers need to reach people where they are -- and OTT media is quickly becoming the default mode of content consumption, as traditional TV providers are <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-02/charter-posts-wider-loss-of-tv-customers-amid-merger-integration"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-02/charter-posts-wider-loss-of-tv-customers-amid-merger-integration&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1534001302671000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEw-N8toS1m5H44t-8X--dwTDSQfA"">losing millions of subscribers </a>each year.

Second, the tools available to create OTT strategies and measure their effectiveness are becoming ever more refined. Today, marketers can identify campaign targets via demographic segments across multiple platforms. The ROI from ad campaigns can be quantified by the use of measurement tools that show how OTT ads perform relative to other platforms.

Taken together, all of this information helps marketers reach an informed understanding about how to optimize their campaigns and allocate their advertising spend.

Facebook and GDPR: Insights from a digital media buying agency,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, and with the European Union implementing its <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/02/14/what-is-general-data-protection-regulation/#4fd477a562dd"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span></a> laws, Facebook has made changes to its <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/policy.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">user privacy policy</span></a>. While the Cambridge Analytica situation was more related to the mishandling of data by app developers, the policy changes have gone beyond app integrations to address bigger privacy concerns that many Facebook users have had for a long time. This has forced most digital media buying agencies into strategy adjustments for their clients.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Many marketers are panic-stricken, asking themselves: ""How will this affect my business marketing activities?"" But fear not, as a top <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Florida advertising agency</a>, we pride ourselves on being intuitive and proactive when it comes to helping our clients understand and navigate changes like this in their industry. In other words, we’ve got your back!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you are using Facebook advertising, you probably use custom audiences or the Facebook Pixel to help you with targeting the proper audiences. As of earlier this year, there are changes you must follow in the way you collect data. New Facebook rules require you to comply with the following 4 actions:</span></p>
<span class=""s1""><strong>1. Get explicit consent from each person in your database to track and remarket to them through Facebook.</strong> </span>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">There are a number of ways to do this including sending a mass email to everyone for whom you have contact information and asking that they reply with their consent.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>From there, you must remove those who deny consent or don’t reply from your database. Yes, that involves some work, but you have to do it to be in compliance.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">2. Make it clear to all website visitors going forward that you are collecting data. </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Many companies today use what is commonly referred to as a “cookie banner” to allow people to accept or decline cookies. You might also seek consent as part of an email list sign-up process. You’ll want to discuss these needs with your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/""><span class=""s2"">web development company</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">3. Make it easy for users to reject cookies and withdraw their consent at any time. </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">For those who change their mind about allowing you to track them, you must have a way to erase all of their data. Of course, the easier that is to do, the less time your team will have to spend doing it. So, coming up with an efficient process is key!</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">4. Be prepared to notify users of a data breach. </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">If hackers get unauthorized access to data in your possession, you must notify everyone whose data is potentially compromised within 72 hours. That isn’t going to be a fun note to send out, but doing it helps protect your customers from the hackers and helps your reputation in the long run. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">How does this affect the value of Facebook as a marketing platform?</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">No question about it… marketers need user data to target and reach the right audience on Facebook, and the new rules will mean that less data is going to be available. This <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">digital media buying agency</a> definitely feels your pain!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Should you quit the platform? No, we’re not recommending that. But, it’s important to give some thought to how your strategy needs to evolve.

How a video production company can help with your LinkedIn ads,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the most effective ways to attract, engage, and inform prospective customers is through a chic, trendy video. Written pieces with still photos will always play a big role in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/""><span class=""s2"">content marketing</span></a>, but time-strapped consumers are increasingly looking to get the information they want and need about a company in video form –- which is where a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">video production company</a> comes into to play. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In many scenarios, it’s just easier to absorb v<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">ideo content.</a> Try to read a brochure or whitepaper when you’re being bounced around on public transportation on your way to the office. But video? That works just about anytime, anywhere. Plus, when video content is done right, it can be both informative and entertaining. Bonus!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Of course, nowadays it’s easier than ever to capture and edit video on your own. However, creating a finished piece that really engages your audience and keeps them watching from start to finish is a lot more challenging. Leveraging the expertise of an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">experienced video production</a> company can be to your advantage in lots of ways. (And you’re looking for an advantage, right?)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Quality video is an effective video</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One benefit of working with a video production company is that the end result will be a polished, professional piece that stands out from the crowd. And make no mistake… there is a crowd. Every marketing pro with a smartphone is a potential video producer/director/editor, but you want your material to adhere to the highest quality standards so it delivers the maximum competitive advantage. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Efficient video production is cost-effective video production</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The more quickly and efficiently a <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/video-marketing-/2018/everything-you-to-know-about-linkedin-video-ads--guide-"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">LinkedIn sponsored video ad</span></a> is produced, the more cost-effective it is. The trial-and-error approach is rarely efficient. Rather than asking your internal team to become video experts, it is typically a smarter choice to connect with a video production company that already has all the skills you need—and many you didn’t know you needed!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Innovative video content is the most shared video</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Creating any kind of video ad for LinkedIn is a start. However, to truly succeed with your video content, you need the assistance of a video production company that can help you capture the attention of business decision makers and move them further along the buyer’s journey using an eye-catching video ad. Experienced video producers know what has and has not been done and what can be done to create a business-building buzz. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">They say “the devil is in the details” and that couldn’t be more true with video production.

Advice on social media stories from a brand positioning agency,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Social stories have only been available for a few years, but as a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning agency</a>, we quickly recognized their marketing potential. Today, our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">expert storytellers</a> use social stories to put a relatable human face on the clients we work with. Humanizing an organization makes it much easier for potential customers to develop a strong relationship and affinity for their products and services. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Why stories sell</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Behavior experts tell us that humans are wired for story. We have what’s been called a “story drive” that makes us hungry for information presented in this format. In fact, we know that storytelling was the primary way that our ancient ancestors communicated. You might say that cave paintings were the first Instagram!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Stories are just as important today. They are the best way to sell a product or service because we connect with them at a deeper level than we do simple information. This is extra important in a generation where our attention span has dropped <a href=""http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/""><span class=""s2"">below that of a goldfish</span></a> (that’s a little embarrassing). People want to know at a glance what you are offering, and stories give them that information in a very quick, visual, and scannable way.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">5 tips on using stories to connect with your audience</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning agency</a>, we’re sharing insider knowledge on leveraging social media stories:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">1. Start slowly</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Rather than diving headfirst into being storytellers across the social spectrum, you and your team should pick a platform and get a good feel for the medium. Instagram is a great place to start, in part because it has an excellent set of tools for creating <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/""><span class=""s2"">social content</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">2. Make the most of the tools available to you</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Many companies get stuck using just the basic functionality on a platform. If you want to create engagement with your audience, it pays to learn about all the features a particular service has to offer so you can make your stories stand out.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">3. Work up to using multiple platforms </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Once you’re comfortable <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">creating stories </a>on one platform, start reworking and repurposing the content you create there in other places. Doing so saves you time and provides consistency for your audience.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">4. Create stories that exhibit both passion and practicality</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">While a story that is simply entertaining will get some attention, one that also provides practical, usable information will be much more widely shared, and we can tell you just how much with our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-monitoring-service/""><span class=""s2"">social media monitoring services</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">5. Be human </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">The “story drive” we have makes us want to hear stories <i>from other humans</i>. Content that looks and sounds like it was produced by a robot won’t engage people and may turn them off. Utilizing content that is relatable and organic will draw more of a crowd.</span></p>

How chatbot observations enhance a full-service advertising agency,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Chatbots are little computer programs designed to engage in lifelike, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">real-time conversation</a> with humans, typically on a company’s website or on social media platforms. If you spend any time shopping on the web, you’ve probably chatted with a bot, whether you knew you were or not.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With ongoing advancements in <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%2520intelligence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a>, the chatbots’ “people skills” are getting pretty impressive. That’s why more companies are starting to take advantage of them to beef up their “human” workforce without actually adding any humans. Businesses are getting a big boost in productivity by letting chatbots handle initial interactions with prospects and customers. In fact, according to a <a href=""https://go.oracle.com/LP=43079?elqCampaignId=79575&amp;utm_source=Triggermail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Post%2520Blast%2520%2528bii-apps-and-platforms%2529:%2520Microsoft%252C%2520Qualcomm%2520partner%2520to%2520build%2520Windows%252010%2520chips%2520%25E2%2580%2594%252080%2525%2520of%2520businesses%2520want%2520chatbots%2520by%25202020%2520%25E2%2580%2594%2520Google%2520brings%2520RCS%2520to%2520Canada&amp;utm_term=BII%2520List%2520Mobile%2520ALL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">study by Oracle</span></a>, 80% of marketing and sales leaders say their organizations already use chatbots or will by 2020, making a partnership with a full-service advertising agency more valuable.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">digital marketing</a> agency that helps companies grow sales by attracting more visitors to their website, we’re thrilled about the power of chatbots to enhance the customer experience. And, we see huge potential for human/AI interactions from our work with clients in providing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/""><span class=""s2"">voice engineering services</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In efforts to emphasize the increasing implementation of chatbots, here are a number of ways that chatbots are changing the marketing and sales landscape:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">24/7/365 availability and prompt answers </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Chatbots don’t sleep, don’t need breaks, and don’t take vacations. They are absolute workaholics and are available to answer questions around the clock. That’s a significant advantage in our ever-more-global economy and with people who have expectations of getting the information they need when they need it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Proactive customer service </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even as a full-service advertising agency we recognize that interactions with human customer service agents are usually reactive; the website visitor asks a question and the staff member replies. Chatbots can be programmed to be proactive. They can offer help when they detect indicators that the visitor is confused or is interested in a particular product or service and ready to “talk” about it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Freeing humans for other tasks </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With chatbots handling initial inquiries, human workers can focus on higher-level tasks, and in the process grow their careers and contribute more to the company’s bottom line.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Zero errors </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Chatbots answer questions accurately every time. Where a human worker might occasionally make a mistake in explaining a promotion, resolving a problem resolution, etc., your faithful chatbot will only share the information that you’ve carefully programmed into it! </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Perfectly calm demeanor </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Everyone knows that customer service can be a little… let’s say… challenging. But while humans might eventually lose their cool with a particularly grumpy prospect or customer, a chatbot never will. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Easier and more complete data collection </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Nobody likes to be faced with a form of seemingly endless fields when they need to provide information. Chatbots can get the required data in a conversational manner that feels less like work for the site visitor. This includes reminders about missing information or explanations about what a particular piece of data is or why it’s needed.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Wondering how chatbots can figure into your marketing efforts, customer service plans, and help drive greater success?

Increase your conversion marketing results using basic ABC’s,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the world of sales, the letters ""ABC"" have their own meaning -- </span><a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/always-be-closing.asp""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Always Be Closing</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. That mantra reflects the salesperson's idealized and conversion <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">marketing-based strategy</a>, one that relentlessly nudges the prospect toward a sale at every point of the interaction. Throughout the stages -- from rapport-building to parrying objections to asking ""do we have a deal?"" -- the prospect is managed in such a way that the only logical response is ""yes, we do.""</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Digital marketers have their own ABC’s -- Always Be Converting. The goal of converting site visitors into paying customers is mission critical for just about every business.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To help you master that process of conversion marketing and bump up that all important conversion rate, we’ve captured eight strategies for improved conversion marketing.</span>

<strong>Use heat maps</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heat maps are graphical representations of data where color is used to represent values. They offer an easy to understand visual summary of information. If that sounds too technical, just think about a television weather forecast and how it uses red to signify hot and blue for cold.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When used with a Web page, a heat map will tell you which areas are generating the most interaction; red for high interaction, yellow for medium, blue for low. These maps are essential for understanding how you can maintain the interest of prospects.</span>

<strong>Refine your call to action</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Too many businesses opt for boilerplate copy when it comes to CTAs. If you want to boost your conversion rate, you need to close with strong, persuasive material.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A CTA doesn't have to be two simple sentences; you can use video, add links or simply dangle a ""cliffhanger"" style ending that piques the interest of the reader and prompts her to find out more.</span>

<strong>Heighten the urgency</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Creating a sense of urgency is one of the oldest tactics in the sales and marketing textbooks for good reason -- it works. This tactic plays on one of the strongest cognitive biases people have, so it's as timeless as it is effective. If potential customers feel like something valuable is slipping away, they will be highly motivated to act.</span>

<strong>Test, test, test</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you A/B testing? If not, it's time to get started. Create two versions of a page with different CTAs, header copy, design etc. Track the number of conversions each page generates. The one with the best numbers is your path to more conversions. Apply A/B testing wherever possible and retest frequently.</span>

<strong>Optimize your funnel</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Buying is a journey -- in most cases, a potential customer cycles through the same series of considerations before ""getting to yes."" Interrupting this process by asking for a sale prematurely can reduce conversions, so make sure your funnel is well developed.</span>

<strong>Use copy that converts</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Great copywriting is an art. It needs to:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reflect your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand voice</a></span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">Position</a> you as trustworthy </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Be calibrated for your specific audience</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Seize the reader's interest immediately</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Be creative yet also universal</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And that's hardly a comprehensive list. If your copy isn't meeting those basic criteria, however, you're losing conversions.</span>

<strong>Illustrate the value proposition</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why should your potential customer convert? Boil it down into an elevator pitch. And let the gist of that pitch flow through all of your copy and marketing materials.</span>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/""><strong>Stress the social proof</strong></a>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People don't innately trust marketing. Yet they do trust other people, which is why word of mouth is so effective.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to convert people sitting on the fence, show them all of your satisfied customers. Use testimonials with photos and reap the benefit of the ""halo effect"" by partnering with influencers.</span>

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Armed with the above strategies to improve your conversion marketing efforts, you’re ready to increase conversion rates and increase ROI.  Yet if you want to truly move the needle, </span><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">contact our team of experts</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> today. </span>",,8/24/2018 16:23,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fabio-santaniello-bruun-763644-unsplash.jpg,increase-your-conversion-marketing-results-using-basic-abcs,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How to optimize your inbound marketing strategy to increase sales,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, a well-written blog post that subtly touts the benefit of the same product that's being cold called elicits a much more favorable response.That's the key distinction between outbound and inbound marketing. One interrupts, the other earns attention from the reader or viewer. And while outbound marketing has its place and time, an inbound marketing strategy is the key to growing commerce.</span>

<strong>Why inbound marketing boosts sales and revenue</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/shamahyder/2018/05/29/this-is-the-new-inbound-marketing/#3f51a33f5f30"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Forbes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, it would be difficult to overstate the true impact a well crafted inbound marketing strategy has on overall brand growth. Marketing emails, commercials and other forms of traditional outbound marketing seek to initiate conversation with audiences. It's an aggressive approach and not particularly clever.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Inbound marketing strategies (such as conventional c<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">ontent marketing,</a> book authorship, viral marketing etc.) attempt something more challenging: Igniting the interest of the audience, and compelling them to seek out a business. It's a more subtle approach -- and also one that can have a significantly larger payoff.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The increased difficulty of reaching prospective customers is one reason why inbound techniques have become more commonplace. Today, we're all inundated with ads, which means that even the most skillfully executed outbound ad can get lost in the shuffle, becoming background noise. Ad-blocking technology, too, has reduced the potency of many traditional outbound ad strategies.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Great inbound marketing, however, can breach the mental blinders that audiences have against conventional advertising by offering something that's useful, actionable, and compelling enough to make a prospect transform from the ""pursued"" to the ""pursuer.""</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To accomplish that, however, you'll need a well-crafted inbound marketing strategy.</span>

<strong>4 Tips for creating an inbound marketing strategy</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strong inbound marketing strategies tend to share a lot of the same characteristics. If you're seeking to implement a new inbound strategy, consider taking the following steps:</span>

<strong>1. Define your audience, your goals and the best environment to reach them.</strong> Who are your buyer personas? Where do they live? What interests them?

<strong>2. Create deeply compelling content.</strong> This is the building block of any successful inbound approach. Give the reader or viewer something with the capability to surprise, delight, entertain or educate, and you'll leave them wanting more. Capturing interest is the first step toward generating more sales.

<strong>3. Ensure that your content is accessible.</strong> There's no point in creating top-level content if it simply disappears into the void. This means you need to focus on modern <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO best practices,</a> or perhaps even consider paid search placement.

<strong>4.Amplify your message and build relationships through social channels.</strong> Skillful use of all the major social platforms is an imperative for businesses seeking to build interest, develop relationships, burnish brand attributes and, create buzz.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Inbound marketing is a powerful tool for boosting sales and revenue -- if executed competently.

6 Tips for creating an eye-catching video marketing strategy,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the majority purchasing consumer audience continues to skew younger, their preferences become ever more important -- and that means video is ascendant. According to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wired </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">magazine, YouTube now reaches more Millennials than any cable network. Even more importantly, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">video</a> is influencing purchasing, making a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video marketing strategy</a> that much more valuable. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A study from Animoto shows that </span><a href=""https://animoto.com/blog/business/millennials-video-infographic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">80% of Millennials</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> use video when making a buying decision, while 76% follow brands on YouTube. And if you think those numbers are impressive, just wait a few years until the even more video-focused Generation Z achieves the same level of buying power as Millennials.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So how can businesses capitalize on this shift? It's simple: Create and distribute the kind of video content that catches attention and converts potential customers.</span>

<strong>Tips for creating a stellar video marketing strategy</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Given that a staggering </span><a href=""https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">one-third of all time </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">spent online is devoted to watching videos, businesses can no longer afford to ignore the impact of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/web-video-production-agency/"">video marketing</a> if they wish to remain competitive. And the traditional reasons many companies have given for avoiding video (cost and time) no longer apply, thanks to the emergence of new technologies.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Preparation and planning, however, are key. So to help you craft a truly effective video marketing strategy, consider the following tips:</span>

<strong>1. Define your goals and establish key performance indicators</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before getting started with content, you need to have an overarching objective: What do you hope to accomplish through video marketing? You'll also need to measure the efficacy of your strategy, so you'll need to establish performance indicators and then track your progress.</span>

<strong>2. Create an attention-grabbing title</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have you seen YouTube titles lately? You'll notice they share many of the same characteristics: Capital letters, lots of human faces making animated expressions and intriguing descriptions. All of these things are proven to increase engagement.</span>

<strong>3. Focus on the first ten seconds</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first few seconds of your video are the most important; they need to jump out at viewers and seize their attention. If a video is too slow to build momentum, viewers will drop away.</span>

<strong>4. Don't be overly focused on what you're selling</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Younger viewers love videos, but they don't love the hard sell. Let interest in the product build organically by taking a subtle approach.</span>

<strong>5. Ensure that it's optimized for mobile and search</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even the best video will be ignored if it doesn't play properly on a smaller screen or if it's inaccessible to your audience.</span>

<strong>6. Go behind the scenes</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is one of the more popular video trends of late -- and for good reasons. Viewers love behind the scenes videos, and they offer an easy way to create compelling content.</span>

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's hard to understate the importance of video marketing, as the statistics illustrate just how pervasive the form has become.

How Google Tag Manager basics can elevate your website analytics,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you've ever fumbled around in the dark, then you have some sense as to what it's like trying to run a business without analytics. If you don't have visibility into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">how your customers are interacting</a> with your online properties and products, then you're essentially working blindfolded.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Data analysis through Google Tag Manager basics allows you to discern trends, analyze behavior and develop new strategies backed by data. To do it well, however, you need the right set of tools.</span>

<strong>Google Tag Manager basics</strong>

<a href=""https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Google Analytics i</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">s one of the most popular tools that businesses use to understand how customers interact with their websites. By tracking and reporting traffic and other data, businesses can evaluate the performance of their marketing initiatives and reach new audiences.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While Google Analytics is powerful, it's not a comprehensive solution. To <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">get the most from your data analysis</a>, it's important to use a variety of tools -- including Google Tag Manager.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By pairing <a href=""https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Google Analytics</a> with Google Tag Manager, businesses can increase the amount of data that's collected. Tags (which are short pieces of code) can be added to a website to collect data.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">digital marketing</a> agency, we know that some of the most common purposes for tags include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Identifying the source of inbound traffic</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Determining which files are downloaded or links clicked</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Monitoring activities such as the addition or removal of items from a shopping cart</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Monitoring the submission of forms</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you probably imagine, the wide range of uses for tags means that they see heavy usage. Managing all of the code involved is often a time-consuming task -- and one that may also be quite frustrating if you're not confident enough to alter your site's source code.</span>

<strong>The benefits of Google Tag Manager</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tag Manager makes the process of adding, changing and removing tags much easier to coordinate. It's easy to use, has an intuitive interface, works with non-Google third party tags and doesn't require alteration of source code. It's also fairly universal, as it works with standard websites (including AMP sites) and mobile content.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to </span><a href=""https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/resources/airbnb-improves-vendor-data-collection-with-tag-manager/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">one case study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Google Tag Manager allowed Airbnb to reduce the usual amount of time needed to deploy a tag from two or three days to as little as one hour. Airbnb was also able to make significant improvements to the precision of its conversion counts, collecting vendor data for 90% of its conversions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While Google Tag Manager can allow business owners or marketers to use tags (freeing up technical staff for more high-value work), the software does require some technical understanding, at least in the beginning. After a walkthrough (or two) with a developer, however, most non-technical people should be able to manage tags with little difficulty.</span>

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Implementing Google Tag Manager is a smart way to jumpstart your data analytics and get more from your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">marketing efforts</a>. If you have any questions about this technology or how it can be used to improve your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing</a>, we urge you to </span><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">contact BIGEYE </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">today.</span>",,8/25/2018 9:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/How-Googe-Tag-Manager-can-elevate-your-website-analytics.jpg,how-google-tag-manager-basics-can-elevate-your-website-analytics,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
3 Essential steps for innovative and new Alexa Skills,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Especially through the implementation of voice advances such as new Alexa Skills, the power of the Internet is now a single swipe away, regardless of time or location. With the introduction of digital assistants, the experience of interacting with the Internet became even less mediated. Now, instead of swiping and actively seeking information, users could simply pose questions and listen to the response.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This innovation has profound impact for businesses and marketers, who are busy developing new Alexa Skills and Google actions to better serve their clients. </span><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At BIGEYE</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, we're part of that trend -- we recognized the importance of smart speakers early and we've been at the vanguard of digital assistant development.   </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that in mind, let's discuss three key things we've learned while developing for digital assistants.</span>

<strong>Intuitive design is critically important</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Standard apps have visual cues that people can use for guidance. Even if they don't entirely understand how the app functions, they can use context clues and visual information to learn how to navigate. They can also scroll back up if any information is forgotten.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alexa Skills don't have visual cues or scrolling ability, which means that it's essential for developers to create logical, intuitive interfaces that are easy to use. Predictive learning is critical; only by anticipating what users are going to say can developers ensure that users don't become frustrated and disappointed.</span>

<strong>Emphasize user experience</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People have different expectations when they use <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice apps </a>-- they expect it to be a more ""human-like"" experience than that seen in an interaction with a graphical interface. Voice apps should play into this expectation and deliver a warm user experience.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Simplicity should also be stressed. Too much complexity will lower engagement with any app, and that's especially true with voice technology -- still an unfamiliar experience for many people.</span>

<strong>Solve a problem</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to create an Alexa Skill that finds a loyal audience, focus on solving a real world problem. Give the user a reason to use the technology frequently by having it address a recurring issue they have to deal with.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These problems don't have to be epic in scale; perhaps it's just an easier way to order a favorite item, or a reminder that something needs to be done. The important thing is that the Skill adds value and is used frequently in daily life.</span>

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Digital assistant technology is being adopted at </span><a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/smart-speaker-sales-on-pace-to-increase-50-percent-by-2019/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">an incredible rate.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Soon, Amazon Alexa and Google Home may become as ubiquitous as the smartphone. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In order to capitalize on this shift, businesses and marketers should apply the insights outlined above during their development efforts. As a top Florida advertising agency, we’ve been integrating these development advances into our own client strategies. </span>

"You need more than a logo, you need a brand development company","You’ve got a cool company <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">name</a>. You’ve got an eye-catching <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo</a>. From a branding perspective, your company is good to go, right? Not so fast! You’re only just getting started.

Brand definition is about much more than a name and a logo. In fact, at our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand development company</a> we advise all our clients — large and small — that there are many elements to a fully defined brand. They include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/""><u>Brand identity:</u></a> This is the unique look of the brand, and the place where many companies incorrectly feel like their work is done.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">Brand messaging:</a> Beyond the way your brand looks, there’s also the way it <em>sounds</em>. Having carefully selected brand messaging is crucial.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">Brand positioning:</a> What segments of the market are you after? Once you’ve answered that question, you need to align your brand with those segments.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">Brand strategy:</a> Creating a brand and launching a successful brand are two very different tasks. You need to have a plan for drawing attention to your new brand identity.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">Brand style guide:</a> Even the most well-defined brands can end up diluted if you don’t have a document your staff can refer to for rules about brand usage. That funky font the sales team wants to use in their email marketing campaign? No can do. Consistency is one of the keys to a strong brand.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How you benefit from the services of a brand development company</strong>

Developing and launching a successful brand takes time and effort. Is it worth it? Oh, yes… <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2016/10/31/why-brand-image-matters-more-than-you-think/#464a55d810b8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">your brand matters more than you think</a>! There are many ways to collaborate with a brand development company to help create a unique brand identity for your business. For example:

<strong>Branding increases awareness</strong>

Even if they aren’t yet ready to become a customer, just making prospects aware of who you are and what you’re offering is helpful.

<strong>Branding differentiates your company</strong>

Your brand can help set you apart from the competition. And, in an ever-more-competitive business landscape, your ability to differentiate yourself can make a huge difference in whether you succeed or… don’t succeed!

<strong>Branding creates trust</strong>

The more your prospective customers are exposed to your brand, the more they believe you’re the “real deal” and are a company they can trust.

<strong>Branding can increase company value</strong>

The evaluation place on your company by outside experts is about more than just your assets. There is tremendous value in having people know who you are and what you stand for.

<strong>Branding increases customer loyalty</strong>

“I use that company for all my ____________.” Customers who have good experiences with a company that has a strong brand are the most loyal customers anywhere. Yes, you have to have good products and services. But back them up with a memorable visual identity and you’ve hit the jackpot!

<strong>Branding inspires your team</strong>

Not all the benefits of a strong brand are external. Your strong brand can serve as a rallying point for your employees, as well.

&nbsp;

<strong>The skill and experience of your brand development company matter</strong>

No disrespect to that friend of a friend who creates logos as her side gig, but you want to work with a top Florida advertising agency with a proven track record in branding. There’s too much at stake. Brand development is an art and a science, and both skill and experience are critical.

Leverage brand messaging services to increase email subscriptions,"People who are interested enough in your products or services to sign up to receive your emails are often just one small step from becoming customers (if they aren’t already). Consequently, the size of your <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/azzam-sheikh/the-importance-of-having-_1_b_8930746.html"">email subscription list</a> is a good measure of your marketing success. Is it the only measure? No… quality counts, too. But (email list) size does matter!

How can you grow that list? One of the best ways is to take advantage of brand messaging services from an experienced agency to ensure you’re saying what prospects want to hear.

<strong><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">Strategies</a> for increasing your email subscriptions</strong>

Use these seven proven brand messaging services tips to add depth to your email subscription list.

<strong>1. Be </strong><b>likable</b>

Sounds like something your grade school teacher would tell you, right? But it matters in business, too. With all the marketing chatter out there, people are much more likely to read something from a company whose<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/""> messaging</a> is friendly and appealing.

<strong>2. Keep it concise</strong>

Consumers today have lots of demands on their time. The more quickly and concisely you can express yourself the better. Some companies think that as long as all the important stuff is in the first paragraph or two, it doesn’t matter how long an email is. This is not the case at all! Think about it… how often have you opened a marketing email, seen that it was multiple paragraphs of text, and immediately deleted it? (Lots of hands are going up on our side!)

<strong>3. Make the benefit of reading obvious</strong>

Again, consumers don’t have a lot of time. The more quickly you get to the specifics of “why you should read this” part, the more likely they are to sign up.

<strong>4. Tease future emails</strong>

In some cases, the information a prospect has received from you may not be of value to them. But, some of the topics you have planned for future emails will be. A “preview of coming attractions” may just be the nudge they need to add their name to your list.

<strong>5. Entice readers with subscriber-only benefits</strong>

Whether it’s helpful information like white papers and case studies, or coupons for significant savings on products and services, consumers are more eager to share their contact information if there’s something in it for them.

<strong>6. Share <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">“social proof”</a></strong>

How have other subscribers benefitted from their email subscription? <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">Sharing their stories</a> can encourage people who are on the fence to sign up.

<strong>7. Create serial messaging</strong>

If the material you want to share is too long for one email, spread it out over two or three emails. The desire to see the next installment is a great incentive for signing up. Just be clear at the start of each email that it is “1 of 3” for example.

Enhance your marketing strategy with display advertising services,"When used the right way, display advertising can deliver exceptional results, whether the goal is to raise awareness, capture leads, or drive sales. The key there is using the ads “the right way.”

Too often, companies spend money on ads that don’t attract the right audience, or worse, attract the wrong audience — people who click an ad with no intention of making a purchase. The best way to ensure you get the maximum return for your advertising investment is to leverage the expertise of an agency that has a proven track record with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">display advertising services</a>.

&nbsp;

<strong>5 Reasons you should add high-impact display ads to your marketing strategy</strong>

Why are display ads an effective addition to any marketing plan? We’ve narrowed it down to five imperative reasons:

<strong>1. They work</strong>

If you spend any time at all on the internet, you’ve seen (and probably ignored) display ads. Ads that are highly targeted with the help of a display advertising services agency still get results.

At the end of the day, we’re all looking for efficiency and convenience in our lives. When we’re in the market for some quality hiking boots and an ad for “Quality Hiking Boots” comes up while we’re surfing the web, what could be more convenient than clicking the ad and making the purchase?

<strong>2. You have full control over starting and stopping ads</strong>

Many forms of advertising involve a lengthy contract. Display advertising gives you the freedom of starting and stopping your ads whenever you like, as often as you like, allowing you to optimize your ad campaign as it runs.

<strong>3. You can get a second chance with retargeting and remarketing</strong>

With <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">retargeting</a>, ads are displayed on other sites in an ad network for people who recently visited your website. In effect, your ads “follow” them around the internet. Sure, there’s a creepy aspect to that. But today’s consumers are familiar with this tactic and will often give in to clicking the ad if the product or service is something they really want or need.

<strong>4. They offer highly refined targeting</strong>

Display ads can be targeted in a number of ways to maximize the “eye share” you get with your ideal prospect. This can include <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenkusek/2014/10/11/5-ways-facebook-geo-targeting-will-change-your-life/#15e8acbe17c4"">geo-targeting</a> in which your ad is shown only to people in a particular geographic area.

<strong>5. They increase brand awareness</strong>

Even if a person doesn’t click on a display ad, simply seeing it starts to create some <a href=""http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/brand-familiarity-reigns-king-around-the-world.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">familiarity with your brand</a>. Over time, familiarity can turn into curiosity, and curious people often become customers!

How an influencer agency connects you with industry trendsetters,"In the scary, dark, pre-internet days, pretty much all you had to rely on when choosing a product or service was what each company had to say about itself. Thankfully the internet is thriving and here to stay, plus there are better and more reliable ways to get an unbiased opinion.

People with in-depth knowledge about consumer needs and the best way to meet those needs — so-called <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/11/14/what-is-influencer-marketing-and-how-can-marketers-use-it-effectively/#31dde7e023d1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">“influencers”</a>— are happy to share their insights about a particular product or service. In fact, for many of them, that’s all they do.

If your business has quality offerings, an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/"">influencer agency</a> can help connect you with an influencer who will review and talk about your product or service with their eager and engaged audience. The results? A new, relatable voice for your company to work with.

&nbsp;

<strong>Reap the benefits of working with an influencer agency</strong>

Establishing a relationship with an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer</a> (which is not always an easy feat) can provide a bunch of benefits for your company.

<strong>Immediate trust</strong>

If you have not already experienced the frustration, building trust in your target market can take months, if not years, on your own. Audiences, however, trust the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">influencers</a> they follow. Obviously, that’s one of the reasons they follow them! If the influencer speaks highly of your product or service… bingo! They’ve effectively transferred their followers’ trust to you.

<strong>Increased awareness</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">Brand positioning</a> is key to a business’ success. If the right influencer recommends your company, you’ve immediately raised your profile and secured a key piece of marketing turf.

<strong>Enhanced content <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">marketing strategy</a></strong>

When you reach a point with an influencer that they are willing to share your material with their followers, you now have a new platform for your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> efforts.

<strong>Increased partnership opportunities</strong>

Prospective customers aren’t the only people who listen to influencers. Potential business partners do as well. Sharing your story through an influencer you’ve found with the help of an influencer agency can lead to connections with organizations whose offerings complement and enhance your own.

<strong>Improved search engine optimization <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">(SEO)</a></strong>

If recognized industry experts create links from their websites to yours, the search engines see your site as more credible and more important, and that can move you up in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">search rankings</a>.

&nbsp;

<strong>Can you connect with influencers on your own? Maybe…</strong>

There’s no rule that says you have to go through an influencer agency to reach an influencer. There’s also no rule that says you have to go through a grocery store to get milk for your cereal. If you’ve got the land and the know-how to raise a cow, have at it!

But, if you want to find the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">right influencers</a> and approach them in the right way so that they are open to learning more about your offerings, it’s wise to leverage the expertise of an influencer agency. The truth is, awkward or overly aggressive outreach can turn off an influencer, and they tend to have long memories!

5 Takeaways from working 365 days at an advertising agency,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I crossed my college graduation stage, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, just 446 days ago. My job at an advertising agency called <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> was secured, and I had just 26 days off between that walk across the stage and my walk through the front door of the agency. While I can not possibly write everything I’ve learned between then and now, I’m hitting a few highlights of my lessons learned in this first year of being a full-time, functioning adult. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over the past year working in an </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">advertising agency</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, I have learned a lifetime of knowledge. If you’re even slightly thinking about a career in the advertising industry, be sure to keep reading, as I unpack 5 key takeaways from this last wonderful, whirlwind of a year at an ad agency. </span>

<strong>1. Keep a warm heart, but grow a thick skin</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the advertising industry it is important to be open and develop relationships with those you work with. Producing creativity requires a lot of vulnerability. However, growing thick skin is essential because our jobs require us to chip away at a marble block of ideas until we’ve created a true work of art for each project. You can not afford to be overly sensitive. </span>

<strong>2. Agency casual vs. college casual</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A common misconception is that because agency office environments tend to be more innovative and less corporate, there is a lower expectation of professionalism. Which to many people translates into ripped jeans and rolling in to work right on time. However, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">advertising agencies</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are still functioning businesses with clients and deadlines to meet. All of those professional advisories you heard in school still ring true in an agency setting. So, wear your hipster glasses or those ripped jeans you love, but do so with style, class, and professionalism - you’ll never know who you are trying to impress.</span>

<strong>3. Play hard, but work harder</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Work life balance is something everyone looks for in a job, but can be difficult to find. While the advertising industry is known to run on a vicious 24/7 cycle, finding a company like <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> who respects those boundaries is crucial. Agency life is not for the faint of heart, there will be late nights and early mornings. But, if you’re not uncomfortable, you’re not growing. Plus, there is nothing like the comradery of your teammates pouring a beer and giving a cheers to a job well done!</span>

<strong>4. Jack of all trades</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collaborative environments allow for the opportunity to dive into multiple projects, opportunities, clients, etc. Be a sponge – soak up and absorb all that you can. Coming straight out of college I lacked real world experience and didn’t know where inside the agency I belonged. I’ve learned that regardless of the department you’re placed in - you can always learn more about the industry itself. Make it a goal to learn all you can about each department in the agency. Stay proactive and make lasting connections. Make your absence be felt and have the courage to jump in and contribute.</span>

<strong>5. Home is where the culture thrives</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Talent is nothing without the right environment and culture to thrive in. The <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">BIGEYE</a> team members are more than just my co-workers, they are my family. These are not just people I see from 9am-5pm, but the ones who I make plans with on the weekends, who bring me soup when I’m out sick, provide meals and helping hands when my house had hurricane damage. Protecting agency culture is important. Build a team with people who will be the best fit, not just because they have the best resume. We can teach skills, we can’t teach attitude and drive.  </span>

<strong>The takeaway </strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Five hundred, twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes…” are lyrics from an incredible broadway show and a great reminder that there are countless moments in a year that measure our knowledge, our passions, our failures and our successes. Working in an </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">advertising agency</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> this past year has taught me more about myself and my capabilities than any other experience I’ve had before. The hustle and bustle of a non-stop, unpredictable day is not for everyone. It is for the bold, it is for the courageous, and it was the perfect choice for me.</span>

How to leverage Alexa’s persistence capabilities to your advantage,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Hey Alexa, what time is it?”, “What is in the news today?”, “What is the weather forecast for today?” The answers to these simple questions can help you jump start your day.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But, what if you need Alexa to remember a more specific piece of information from previous interactions? For example, the last time you took your medication or your current progress in an adventure game. This capability is known as persistence - a feature that is not being fully utilized by many companies or the<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/""> voice engineering services</a> firms they work with. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alexa answering your question about the weather is helpful, but she can also remember that you inquire about the forecast first thing every morning when you wake up. This recollection allows Alexa to offer you the information as part of the conversation rather than a one time exchange, showcasing the true value of digital assistants. It is persistence that enables her to remember and recall information, providing a more anthropomorphic, or human-like, personality.</span>

<strong>The purpose behind persistence </strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The goal in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">developing voice applications</a> is providing interactions with Alexa that are more conversational and less transactional. An interaction along the lines of “Alexa, order me some coffee,” to which she responds, “What type of coffee would you like to order?” sounds completely transactional. Compare that to something like, “Alexa, order me some coffee,” to which she replies, “Sure, I see you ordered a dark roast last week and Colombian the week before. Would you like either of these or a new type of coffee?” Both of these conversations will result in you getting coffee, but the interactions are profoundly different. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Imagine asking your significant other their favorite restaurant every day for weeks and weeks. Odds are you would stop asking because after hearing the answer a few times your brain would commit it to memory. Then, you could capitalize on persistence and take your significant other out for a surprise dinner at that special spot. The thrill they get from knowing you remembered is how you should feel every time you interact with Alexa. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Techopedia, a technology-based encyclopedia resource, defines </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">persistence as “an object or a process characteristic that continues to exist even after the process that created it ceases or the machine it is running on is powered off.” In the case of voice applications for Alexa, persistence means that even if your skill is not currently in use, the responses that have been given in the past are still in memory. And, can be called upon the next time that you invoke your skill. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With this feature, the programming possibilities are endless. Skills from Jeopardy to Skyrim use persistence to create unique, engaging experiences that bring users back over and over. Imagine the benefit to your business of producing that kind of appeal in a voice application!</span>

<strong>Getting started</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, you are probably wondering, how does persistence work? Luckily, we are here to help break it down for you with a few simple steps:</span>

1. You need to come up with a voice UX design that will help you determine what information your application needs to commit to memory and how that data will help your skill.

2. Next, you need a place to store this data and for that, you need a database such as DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational) database, which makes the storing of data more efficient. Non-relational databases are like the class jock from your high school. He’s great at one thing, but doesn’t do well with relationships. The diagram below shows a solution architecture using DynamoDB.

3. DynamoDB is separate from the core services, yet it is still highly performant. To develop this type of solution, you first create your environment inside of the database that will be holding your data. Next, you add methods that will save and retrieve data from your database for use by your skill.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">4. Finally, you need a way to give users the option to save this data (see diagram 2 for an example of how to store data programmatically).</span>

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-25189"" src=""https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/diagram-2.png"" alt="""" width=""796"" height=""451"" /><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diagram 2</span></em>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How to give users the option to save or in this case what is known as a ‘save intent’ can be seen in diagram 2 and 3. This can be something as simple as asking Alexa to “save my medications for the day.”</span>

<em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img class=""alignleft wp-image-25201"" src=""https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-07-at-4.32.16-PM.png"" alt="""" width=""795"" height=""369"" />Diagram 3</span></em>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once this architecture is in place, the new methods you develop will be able to create, update, read, and destroy data as the skill is used. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you start storing data, you may need to refactor the existing method that will handle your skill. This is the handler that will give your skill the functionality to call upon this stored data and produce meaningful responses. For example, imagine a skill that will help users keep track of their medications, including whether or not they have already taken medication today and the amount in which they have taken. Let’s call it Medi Buddy. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The interaction might look something like this: </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">User: “Alexa, open Medi Buddy.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alexa: “Welcome to Medi Buddy. What medications have you taken today?”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">User: “Tylenol.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alexa: “You have now taken two doses today. Please be mindful of this.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Or, asking Alexa the same question from a different perspective...</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">User: “Alexa, ask Medi Buddy how many doses of Tylenol I have taken today.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alexa: “You have taken two doses of Tylenol today.”</span>

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Medi Buddy stores data on medications taken allowing Alexa to use that information in two different contexts. In some instances, that capability simply makes interactions more positive. In others, like our Medi Buddy, its ability to grasp medical facts could be a lifesaver.</span>

Want deeper insights into your attribution modeling? Ask a model,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Marketing used to be a lot simpler. Businesses had just a handful of channels to operate in, making assigning credit for purchases a fairly trivial task. These days, channels have proliferated and we have seen a vast increase in the number of consumer touch points. <a href=""https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1662518?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Attribution modeling</a> is one of the best solutions for tracking sales costs and campaign success.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Attribution modeling explained</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As the complexity of marketing processes has grown, simple yet critically important tasks -- such as determining the source of sales and conversions -- have become markedly more difficult. Customers typically don't just go straight to a website and click the buy button. Sales are usually the result of multiple interactions across a variety of platforms prompted through a series of messages or interactions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2""><a href=""https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1662518?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Attribution modeling</a></span><span class=""s1""> is a framework that allows organizations to gain greater visibility into how credit for sales and conversions should be awarded or divided. There are multiple ways to model or map out credit. These model varieties serve as a set of rules for how credit is assigned to specific touch points within <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">conversion paths.</a></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">To better illustrate how this works; let's take a look at some basic<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/attribution-modeling-company/""> attribution models. </a></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">First and last interactions models</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Under these rules, a single source earns credit for the sale. Using the first <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">interaction model</a>, the touch point that initiates contact (perhaps a downloaded white paper) would receive full credit for any sale or conversion. Under the last interaction model, the final touch point (something like a sales call) earns all the credit. While these are fairly easy to implement and track, they don't always provide a full picture of how a customer arrived at a buying decision.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Linear, time decay and U-shaped/position-based models</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Under these rules, multiple sources can receive credit for sales. The linear model attempts to give every touch point equal credit, while the time decay model gives greater weight to touch points that are later in the buying process. The U-shaped/position-based model gives greater weight to early and later touch points and reduced credit to those in the middle.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Choosing the right attribution model depends on a variety of factors, including the <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6394265?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">amount of data that is accessible </span></a>and the overall complexity of the marketing campaign. Simpler campaigns with fewer moving parts may have enough visibility to make one-source attribution models a viable choice. Businesses may also create their own custom attribution models that assign weight to touch points based on their own specified criteria.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Given the challenges businesses face in the realm of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/""><span class=""s3"">digital marketing</span></a>, developing a useful model for assigning credit is an essential part of generating accurate ROI assessments. Companies that make this a priority will earn a significant competitive edge when designing sophisticated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/""><span class=""s3"">multi-platform marketing campaigns</span></a>.</span></p>

Why the smartest brands pay attention to typeface,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When it comes to top brands, excellence filters all the way down to the details. No single element is unimportant enough to escape careful consideration -- and that includes <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">fonts</a>. For brands that lack the resources or expertise to create stellar fonts, partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/""><span class=""s2"">creative branding agency</span></a> is a logical step.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Three reasons why fonts are crucial to your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">branding</a> efforts</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A font may be (quite literally) a small thing. Yet, it is a serious error to underestimate the power of the role it plays. The right font selection can have a serious impact on the effectiveness of your company’s branding.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Consider the <a href=""https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/bodoni"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">Bodoni font</span></a>, which has a clean and classic look that's made it perennially popular in the world of high fashion (Vogue Magazine's famous logo is one such example). Because Bodoni is so closely linked with that particular milieu, those seeking to give their brand a touch of class and sophistication can earn a head start by using Bodoni.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Or consider the counter-example of <a href=""https://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/comic-sans"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">Comic sans</span></a>, Microsoft's attempt to create a playful, comic book-inspired font. Universally reviled, any non-ironic use of Comic sans is likely to be greeted with ridicule at best, antipathy at worst. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overall, font design is critical to brand success for three key reasons. These include:</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">1.Tone setting</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> Before an audience even begins to process words, it first must process how those words are presented. So, in this sense, the typeface sets the tone for how a brand is ultimately perceived. Bodoni gives your logo or written content a classy, high style connotation. By setting the tone for what follows, font choice plays an essential role in how audiences respond to what they see.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">2.Legibility</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> When it comes to fonts, it is not all form over function. Aesthetics need to work hand in glove with practical concerns like readability. The right font choice makes all visual imagery more accessible, which in turn engenders positive feelings in audiences. A cluttered font or a font that distracts due to being inappropriate for the context (think comic sans in business correspondence) is a serious turn-off. Brands need to choose a font that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">improves legibility across every platform</a>, channel, and device possible.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">3.Values and identity</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> Font selection plays an integral role in telling the public who you are. It gives the audience a sense of your values, your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">identity</a>, and organizational personality. The right font should help tell a brand's story; in fact, it should serve as that story's introduction. Choose a font that clashes with your intended branding and identity and the audience will receive a contradictory message that makes a business seem amateurish and unfocused.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Working with the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">right branding agency</a></span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The importance of a great font should never be underestimated. Some organizations, however, lack the experience or expertise to operate in this area without the assistance of a branding agency.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">top Florida advertising agency</a> like BIGEYE can help you choose or design a font that delivers brilliant form and function. <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact/""><span class=""s2"">Contact our design team</span></a> today to get your brand fonts in order!</span></p>",,9/16/2018 22:48,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Why-the-Smartest-Brands-Pay-Attention-to-Typeface-.jpg,why-the-smartest-brands-pay-attention-to-typeface,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
"Warm messages, cold devices: Branding authentic digital connections","It is not difficult to understand why consumers respond to a personal connection, as the evidence is overwhelming. Consider the persistent power of word-of-mouth advertising, for example. Today's companies can create an extraordinarily sophisticated and insightful marketing campaign -- support this campaign with bleeding-edge technological tools -- and still lose a customer, simply because she was given a different word-of-mouth recommendation.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/"">Marketing</a>, at its core, attempts to facilitate these kinds of personal connections between brands and their audiences, whether intellectual or emotional. When this is done well, it creates brand intimacy, a close, personal and enduring bond between people and the companies they use and love.

Yet these all-important human connections must be forged in an era where people are becoming increasingly <a href=""https://psmag.com/social-justice/americans-are-staying-as-far-away-from-each-other-as-possible"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">atomized and distant</a>. Fifty years ago, people joined fraternal organizations, participated in civic life, went bowling together and lived in relatively close proximity.

Today, popular fraternal organizations such as the Lions Club or Rotary Club have withered, civic participation <a href=""http://prospect.org/article/strange-disappearance-civic-america"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">is at record lows</a>, bowling leagues are considered retro entertainment, and suburban sprawl has created unprecedented physical distance between neighbors.

These developments have created a tear in the social fabric of society, as the public commons have grown ever smaller, and people fail to socialize and form connections. Mutual trust <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/davos-world-economic-forum-public-trust-in-institutions-at-record-low-media-government-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">is also at record lows</a>, as we continue to retreat into private spaces rather than the public sphere.

All of this raises a few important questions: Is technology to blame for societal atomization? Are our devices alienating us from each other?

If so, how should marketers respond?

<strong>Technology and its distancing effect on audiences</strong>

People have always looked to technology as a means of reducing distance. The telegraph and telephone brought unimaginable change to the 19th century; television and the Internet did the same for the 20th century.

Yet while technology may offer a soldier the opportunity to speak with his children from thousands of miles away -- facilitating a profound human connection in the process -- that same technology can also have an alienating effect.

Walk into any restaurant today, and you'll inevitably witness two people sitting across from each other idly scanning their smartphones rather than speaking, or even looking at each other. This scenario is now so common as to be almost the default expectation. Research has shown that when mobile devices are present in a face-to-face interaction, both <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916514539755"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">empathy levels, and attention wane</a>.

Theoretically, smartphones and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social platforms</a> have given us much greater (near total, in some cases) visibility into each other’s lives, something that should facilitate greater connections. Yet social media is often full of artifice; a hyper-curated representation that bears little relationship to lived reality, and too often inspires feelings of anxiety, envy or sadness in others. For all of its communal pretensions, social media is often an alienating experience.

The truth is simple: People change at glacial pace and technology changes at breakneck speed. The changes we've experienced, particularly in the last 30 years, have been extraordinary, and we still have little notion as to the long-term effect.

Whether this is ultimately for good or ill is an open question. It does, however, present a specific challenge for brands seeking to create meaningful connections with audiences in this environment: How can we forge human connections through machines that are often alienating in their effect?

<strong>How brands create human connection across machines</strong>

The correlation of a warm human connection delivered via a cold collection of hardware and software is a striking one. Humans, at our core, have always had mixed feelings about technology -- one look at dystopian science fiction makes this techno-anxiety palpable.

Brands, of course, are highly motivated to create these invaluable connections, and they understand how powerfully modern technology can facilitate them. This means that brands must strike a delicate balance: Use technology to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">deliver compelling and emotionally resonant marketing messages</a> without tapping into broader human anxiety about that technology.

Marketing campaigns for Charter, one of the world's largest telecommunications firms, provide a good example of how to thread this needle. Charter's TV commercials have a notable tendency to depict large groups of people singing and dancing while surrounded by computers, screens, and other devices. In this representation, the technology is present, but it takes a definite backseat to humans interacting together within their natural social context.

Technology firms aren't the only organizations attempting to take a more humanistic approach to advertising and marketing. Charter's campaigns are following a larger trend toward <a href=""https://hbr.org/2013/03/advertisings-new-medium-human-experience"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">brand personalization and human experience</a>.

Aviation firm JetBlue created its clever <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8TWEeWuKJI"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""Air on the Side of Humanity""</a> campaign to connect with air travelers who felt alienated by the impersonal process of taking commercial flights. A generation ago, boarding a plane did not require navigating strict security protocols, and the experience was far more relaxed. JetBlue's campaign skillfully highlights the ""chicken run meets DMV"" aspect of modern flying and positions the company as a more humanistic alternative, simply by acknowledging how cold and impersonal commercial flight often feels.

The banking sector has also become rapidly depersonalized in recent years, as automation and other technologies have reduced the need for tellers. Thanks to ATMs and online banking, many people may go months or even years without speaking to someone at their bank. The primary tradeoff for this efficiency is, of course, the human touch.

In order to compensate, BMO, TD Bank and other financial services firms have created advertising campaigns that emphasize the ""human"" angle of their business. Meanwhile, global insurer Liberty Mutual dispensed with subtlety altogether, using ""Human"" -- the Human League's inescapable number one single from 1986 -- as background music for a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfyWct2FJBU"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">high-profile ad</a> that ran during the 2012 London Olympics.

These efforts illustrate the value of an authentically human and personal approach to marketing messaging. Today, so many of our interactions with the companies we patronize are not only mediated through technology but wholly lacking any human connection. Consider how virtual receptionists attempt to route your calls and answer your questions without the need for a person. Or consider the proliferation of A.I.-powered chatbots; most of them are programmed to sound human, and nearly all of them utterly fail in the attempt.

These approaches may be more efficient, but they are often alienating, and make those on the other end feel unimportant. As A.I. and machine learning evolve and mature, our interactions with businesses will grow ever more distant. This means that marketing messages need to be more authentic, resonant and personalized than ever before.

By making an effort to close the alienating distance created by technology, brands can create the kind of deep and meaningful connections that inspire persistent loyalty among audiences.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Technology is a double-edged sword in terms of fostering connections. While it removes the impediment of physical distance, it often creates a different sort of distance, more emotional or psychological in nature.

Brands that prioritize authentic human connection in their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">messaging</a> will be best <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">positioned</a> to mitigate the distancing and alienating effect of technology -- ultimately creating the kind of deep personal bonds that create brand intimacy and earn long-term loyalty.

Play to win: Why an influencer outreach agency partners with gamers,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Think gamers are too niche of an audience for your business to pursue? Guess again. These days, <a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/29/11539102/gaming-stats-2016-esa-essential-facts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">virtually every household has a gamer, </span></a>and most have more than one. Whether we are talking about die-hard gamers streaming their exploits on Twitch or the businesswoman who relaxes with Candy Crush on her smartphone, gaming permeates our common culture. Working with the right <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">influencer outreach agency</a> can help you take advantage of these unexploited outlets.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Influencer marketing connects gamers and brands</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first thing to understand about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/""><span class=""s3"">influencer marketing</span></a> and gaming is that the two are inextricably linked -- influencer marketing is pervasive in the gaming industry. Brands hire top e-sports stars to pitch their products and video game makers use real-world athletes to pitch their games.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This means that gamers, as an audience, are conditioned to respond to influencer marketing in a way that general audiences are not. Gamers are also a massive market; by 2020, there are projected to be <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/its-time-for-brands-to-stop-ignoring-the-mobile-gaming-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">213 million mobile gamers alone.</span></a> The demographics of this audience aren't necessarily what you might envision. More than half of mobile gamers are women, one-third are older than 45 and most have <a href=""https://www.chartboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChartboostMobileGamingAudience.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">significant disposable income.</span></a></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sounds like an ideal mix for brands and marketers, right? The next step, however, is critical: Finding the right partners to maximize a brand's reach and influence.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Identifying the right influencers</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Influencers come in many forms in the gaming industry. They include professional e-sports players, amateur game streamers with massive followings on YouTube, Twitch, game developers, and other content creators.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because becoming a gaming influencer can be a very ""bottom up,"" democratized process (barriers to entry for building an audience are very low), those who wield the most influence in the gaming sphere may be little known among the larger public. This shouldn't dissuade you from working with someone, however.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Gaming audiences also tend to be rabid in their support for their favorite players, developers and streamers -- the most popular of whom generate millions of dollars from donations and advertising revenue.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-agency-tactics/"">working with influencers</a>, it's also important to allow them the creative latitude to highlight or pitch your product in their preferred fashion. They understand their audiences better than any outsider ever could, and it's important that any pitch or placement be done in an authentic and organic manner.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Finding the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">right influencer</a>, however, may require working with an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/""><span class=""s3"">influencer outreach agency</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Need help getting started?</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you're unfamiliar with the conventions of gaming culture -- or influencer marketing -- it's a smart idea to partner with someone with a firm grasp on both. A top Florida marketing agency like BIGEYE can play a critical role in helping you find the right gaming influencers and kick-starting a new, highly effective <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">targeted</a> campaign.</span></p>

Success is written in the stars and creative brand consulting,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Can a business guarantee its own failure before it even opens? Absolutely. Poor planning and strategic misjudgments can end any prospect of success before the doors open. Yet more aesthetic decisions -- such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">designing a logo</a> -- can also play a critical role in long-term success. That's one reason why <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">creative brand consulting</a> is such a valuable service for many of today's fledgling enterprises.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Why the right logo makes all the difference</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Some new business owners view the creation of a logo as a second-level task. If they can devise a clever one, great, but if not, no big deal.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You'd never find this kind of indifference in the C suite of a Fortune 500 firm, however. The most successful companies understand that their logo is the core of their visual identity and a cornerstone part of the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">overall brand.</a> <a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-power-of-a-good-logo/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Research has shown </span></a>that logos can impact not only the public perception of a company but also its performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A logo is often the consumer's first impression, for better or worse, and the first thing that comes to mind when a company is named. These perceptions are so powerful that even <a href=""https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/minds-business/the-shape-of-a-logo-has-a-powerful-impact-on-consumers120911.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">the mere shape of a logo </span></a>can elicit powerful feelings about a brand in the eyes of consumers.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you're skeptical, just think about the cultural cachet carried by the golden arches, the Nike swoosh, or that famous apple with one bite removed. A logo, when executed properly, is everything great about a brand compressed into one brilliant signifying image.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All of which raises a key question: How do you create a logo that truly stands out?</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Creating eye-catching logos</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Great logos tend to have shared attributes, and these common features can serve as a road map of sorts for the creation of your own standout logo. Being a creative brand consulting agency, we have narrowed down some of the most important design principles in logo creations include:</span></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Originality. In order to stand out a logo needs to separate itself from the routine visual imagery we process every day. </span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Simplicity. An overly complex logo turns viewers off. The best logos are elegantly simple and instantly recognizable.</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Connection. A logo doesn't have to directly represent what's being sold (Nike doesn't sell swooshes, after all) but it should bear some connection with the company's brand and story.</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Colors. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/color-theorys-critical-but-often-hidden-role-in-marketing/""><span class=""s2"">As we've written before, </span></a>color is critical to marketing. Different colors evoke different emotional responses. Understanding this is key to developing a striking logo that elicits the response for which you're aiming.</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""> Flexibility. Today, logos appear in a large number of contexts (social media, TV, print, billboards) and devices (phones, tablets, laptops). A great logo should work well across any context and on any device, regardless of size or background constraints.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">How <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">creative brand consulting</a> can help create the perfect logo</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Developing a logo that meets all the necessary design elements is no small task for most business owners. A top Florida advertising agency like BIGEYE, however, has the necessary expertise and experience to create visually arresting logos that immediately stand out to consumers.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> By applying our insights into <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/production-design-services/"">design aesthetics</a> and color theory, we can help you craft a logo that instantly conveys your brand story, forging an immediate connection with your desired audience. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/""><span class=""s4"">Connect with us</span></a> today about refreshing a previously existing brand or developing a new logo! </span></p>",,9/20/2018 8:00,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Success-is-written-in-the-stars-and-creative-brand-consulting.jpg,success-is-written-in-the-stars-and-creative-brand-consulting,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Looking for better classroom engagement? Work with Alexa...,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In just a few years, digital assistants have gone from a novelty to nearly ubiquitous. Much like the smartphone revolution a decade earlier, Amazon Alexa and Google Home are transforming the way we live, work and learn. This could not be more apparent anywhere else than in the classroom, where Alexa programming is helping drive superior educational outcomes while getting students more engaged with the learning process.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">How voice technology is being implemented in classrooms</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Products such as Amazon Alexa are a natural fit for today's classroom. They are relatively inexpensive to purchase, they can be easily programmed to provide a vast amount of educational functionality and -- most importantly -- students love interacting with A.I.-driven <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice assistants</a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So, how are teachers and administrators using Alexa and other platforms in the classroom? Let's take a look at a few of the most popular implementations:</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Storytelling </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Alexa is capable of reading stories to students, <a href=""https://blog.tcea.org/alexa-teacher-assistant/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">including popular audiobooks.</span></a> This is particularly well-suited for younger classrooms, where the novelty of having a voice assistant lead ""story time"" is always an attraction.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Mathematics </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In addition to reading stories, Alexa has the ability to perform calculations and teach basic math skills. This can liven up instruction and provide teachers with an easy resource to check student work after class is over.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">History lessons </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Along with her ability to spin a tale, Alexa is also a current events whiz, as she can offer daily news rundowns. Alexa programming also allows teachers to use the device to administer historical trivia games and other content.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Science </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Alexa can also be programmed to deliver basic science lessons on everything from biology to the natural world or deliver popular science-focused podcasts.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Administrative functions</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Teaching isn't all about lecturing or offering hands-on instruction. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Alexa's programmed skills</a> can help teachers with classroom time management tasks (by setting reminders) along with providing students a resource to <a href=""https://edscoop.com/voice-command-technology-alexa-how-can-you-improve-teaching-and-learning"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">discover information on their own</span></a>, without having to interrupt the teacher.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These implementations represent just a few of the ways Alexa is being used to improve the learning experience. As the number of Alexa voice applications (or ""skills"") continues to grow, teachers will have an even greater number of creative, voice-based approaches to deploy in the classroom.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Preparing for a voice-activated future</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Growth in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/""><span class=""s3"">voice assistant market</span></a> has been explosive in recent years -- and adoption of smart speakers is projected to rise by <a href=""https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/642969/voice-assistants-use-grow-1000-reach-275-million-by-2023-juniper-says/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">another 1000% </span></a>by 2023. We are quickly shifting from a world mediated through a keyboard to a world that is run largely by voice command.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Whether at home, in the office or in the classroom, voice assistants are quickly becoming our default option for interfacing with the connected world. Schools that stay at the vanguard of this change will be best equipped to help their students navigate this transition.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A top Orlando marketing agency like BIGEYE can assist in this process by delivering sophisticated <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Alexa programming services</a> at a competitive rate.

Why pop up trade schools need great technical college marketing,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Pop up restaurants -- all the rage a few years ago -- allowed people to break the usual dining mold by eating in homes, temporary storefronts and other non-traditional dining spaces. This concept has now been extended to education in the form of pop up schools, which offer a cheap, easily replicable model for learning in non-traditional spaces.  It's a trendy idea -- and a potential challenge for those involved in technical college marketing.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">How do traditional technical colleges compete with the innovative trend of pop up learning? Let's take a closer look.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Pop up schools explained</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The idea for pop-up schools was borne of the difficulty in ensuring access to affordable educational services across the globe. The cost of education has risen significantly in recent years, and barriers to education (particularly in the developing world) have risen.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Pop-ups such as <a href=""https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=39462"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Bridge International</span></a> seek to introduce a new, highly replicable model that promises affordable education -- a model that is in some ways based on <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/3021579/easy-to-replicate-pop-up-schools-can-educate-millions-in-the-developing-world"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">the idea of fast food franchising</span></a>.  Bridge International, for example, hoped to scale up to 3,000 schools in Africa alone by using a franchise model, enrolling as many as 25 million students by 2025.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The pop-up model has <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">influential backers</a> (The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among others) and plenty of market opportunity, positioning it as a potential competitor for the traditional technical school model.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All of that raises an important question: How can technical college marketing benefit your school and help you stand out?</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">How smart technical college marketing offers a competitive edge</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The idea of pop up education is an attractive one -- at first glance. However, it's not a model that would currently serve the needs of most technical college students. Virtually all pop-up schools are pure profit-making ventures; curriculums are rote, inflexible and uniform across each school. Salaries for instructors are kept very low to manage costs and there is very little focus on specific trade or technical skills. Pop up schools instead are more broadly focused.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Still, it's an innovative model and one that could soon find more traction in other educational markets, as politicians and other leaders are always looking for cost-competitive solutions. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In order to fend off this kind of competition, the value proposition offered by technical schools should be reflected in its <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/""><span class=""s3"">marketing content</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Some of the best ways to do this include:</span></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Developing sophisticated buyer/student personas</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Creation of compelling, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/""><span class=""s3"">multi-channel marketing</span></a> content that reflects the interests of those personas</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Developing materials that emphasize the benefits of the technical college model (shorter, less expensive, real-world skill development, etc.)</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Developing materials that emphasize the proven and durable nature of the technical school model -- the pop-up model is new and unproven, and no student wants to attend a school that may not exist in five or ten years</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">Use of social media platforms</a> and advanced data analytics to support marketing efforts</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Partnering with the right agency</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The tips outlined above may seem fairly straightforward, but executing them at the highest level is no small task. Many smaller schools do not have the resources or the expertise to create a sophisticated modern marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At BIGEYE, we help schools stand out from the competition by creating deeply resonant and<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/""> highly targeted marketing campaigns</a>.

Work with a social media strategy company for instant engagement,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Instagram is scorching right now. No other platform has its mix of cultural cachet and daily traffic (Instagram has doubled its user base <a href=""https://business.instagram.com/blog/safety-and-kindness-for-800-million/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">in the last two years</span></a>, and posts on Instagram receive more engagement than on any other platform).  This means that it's become a hotly-contested digital battleground for today's brands, all of which are seeking to grow and cultivate their audience. To get the most out of Instagram, it's imperative to understand and optimize your metrics -- and partnering with a<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/""> social media strategy company</a> is often the best way to do that.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Instagram metrics: The basics</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you want to maximize the resources you devote to Instagram, s<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/quantitative-research-services/"">killful use of analytics is essential.</a> By understanding these metrics, you gain deeper insight into what people truly like and respond to, plus get a better grasp on the effectiveness of your strategy. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media strategy company</a>, we want to help you refine your approach. Let's take a look at some basic metrics:</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Impressions </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This metric shows you how often your post, profile or story has been viewed during a specified period of time. If one person views the same post three times, that counts as three impressions.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Reach</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> Though similar to impressions, reach only measures the number of people who have seen the content. The percentage of your followers who have seen an individual post is referred to as the ""reach rate.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Engagement</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This measures all the ways someone interacts with content (likes, comments, etc.). The number of interactions divided by your follower number is your engagement rate.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Engagement-on-Reach</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This metric takes the number of comments, likes etc. and divides them by reach rather than follower number. The subsequent number is your engagement-on-reach rate.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These are four of the most frequently used metrics on the platform -- all of which are easily accessible when using the ""view insights"" button on an Instagram for Business account. Other available metrics include follower growth, website and email clicks, as well as exits and swipe away (the latter two show you how many viewers exited a story without watching all the way through or swiped to another <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/""><span class=""s3"">piece of content</span></a>).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When taken in total, all of these metrics provide a fairly deep window into the relative performance of your Instagram content. It's important to view metrics such as reach and engagement for what they truly are: Not a popularity contest, but an opportunity to leverage engagement for the direct benefit of your business, ultimately creating more sales.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Using a social media strategy company to help optimize your approach</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Engagement on Instagram is a staggering <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242659"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">15 times higher </span></a>than engagement on Facebook. Instagram is also perfectly suited to brand cultivation and audience building. There is no better digital platform on which to tell your brand story and build an audience. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a> like BIGEYE can help you better understand and optimize your metrics, and tell your brand story in the most effective and compelling way possible.

Does your brand talk about you? Use a brand story agency,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Human beings are natural storytellers. From our earliest days, we've shared stories, shaped myths and passed them down through each generation, using them to explain, entertain and educate. The most successful brands understand how important a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">great story</a> is to public perception -- which is one reason why working with a specialized <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story agency </a>is often the best move.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">By developing a compelling<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/""> brand story</a>, customers view businesses for what they truly are: A collection of real people working to deliver a product or service that improves the customer's life, rather than another faceless and distant organization.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2""><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-neuroscience-of-your-brain-on-fiction.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Neuroscience research has shown </a></span><span class=""s1"">that narratives have a profoundly stimulating effect on the human mind; in fact, if one looks at scans of the brain, there is little difference between reading or hearing a story and experiencing the same thing -- all the same neurological regions of the brain are activated. A brand story, like any other story, has immense potential for creating rich and meaningful connections with audiences.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With that in mind, let's take a closer look at five tips for improving your existing brand story.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Identify your protagonist</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There's a reason why almost every story needs a hero; the archetypal <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%2527s_journey"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">""hero's journey"" </span></a>is one of the oldest story patterns we have, and one that is found in virtually every human culture. It has endured this long for one reason: People respond to it on a deep, emotional level.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A brand protagonist doesn't need to be a figure like Hercules and doesn't even need to be overtly or classically heroic. It might be a founder (think about the iconic power of a Steve Jobs or Ray Kroc), a spokesperson or simply the company itself. Yet it should always help forge a connection with your audience. Remember, brand stories need to go deeper than conventional advertising; when executed correctly, they create emotional resonance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Make it Relatable</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-outreach-agency/"">""Put people in your photos""</a> is the first thing any news photographer is taught. Why? Because people are drawn to each other, much more than we're drawn to landscapes or buildings. The same holds true in storytelling.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your brand story should focus on how your product or service improves the lives of everyday people. It should be authentic and compelling, feeling personal yet also universal.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Cut Through the Clutter</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We've all started reading a boring story and stopped after a few uninspiring paragraphs, never to pick it up again. To maintain audience interest, it's vitally important to seize their attention immediately.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When crafting a brand story, originality and creativity are paramount. It's impossible to sell to an audience if you cannot hold their attention.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Focus on Simplicity</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When telling a story, needless complexity distracts the audience and increases the risk of disengagement. This is especially true for brand stories (after all, we're not creating War and Peace, here). In order to avoid this, it's important to tell your brand story in a simple fashion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">To do this, keep your story focused on the problems you can solve for real people while still allowing your brand personality to shine through.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Make Sure You Answer Two Fundamental Questions</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Every brand story should address two essential questions: Who are you and why are you in business?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Audiences want to know who they are patronizing and the values you stand for. They also want to know why you're in business -- and the answer has to be more than just ""to make a profit."" Use your story to explain your values and the value you can add to your customers' lives.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Working With a Brand Story Agency</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Creating a compelling brand story is a real challenge -- especially for small to mid-sized businesses. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/""><span class=""s2"">At BIGEYE,</span></a> we have the storytelling expertise to help you create the kind of brand identity that moves the needle. </span></p>

Amazon Scout: The newly debuted Pinterest competitor,"Few would deny the globe-conquering vision of Jeff Bezos and Amazon. When others were scoffing at the potential of e-commerce, Bezos was busy laying the groundwork for the world's first ""everything store.""

Yet what if flipping retail from something you do in a store to something you do in your pajamas is only the beginning? What if you could turn the act of online shopping into something truly personalized and social?

That's the premise behind <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/scout"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Amazon Scout</a>, a new service that aims to integrate some of Pinterest's personalized functions with Amazon's wide-reaching <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce</a> platform.

<strong>How Amazon Scout works</strong>

The idea is simple: Today, our impetus for visiting Amazon is generally need-based. When batteries or food supplies run low, Amazon is but a mere click away. Amazon Scout offers consumers a new way to interact with the platform, one that mimics the experience of window-shopping. By liking or disliking products, users receive recommendations from Amazon's sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

The ultimate goal is to deliver an experience that surprises and delights a consumer. After all, there is little joy in simply ordering a new set of replacement batteries. Yet discovering an item that you never knew you wanted is deeply appealing (just consider how much better a favorite song sounds when you randomly stumble across it on the radio, rather than going through the process of cueing it up yourself).

Amazon Scout is currently in its testing phase, and the company is deploying the service in especially visual product categories such as home decor and women's shoes. By rolling out Scout, Amazon hopes to outmaneuver Pinterest's development of ""buyable pins,"" while also incorporating some of the personalized elements that have allowed e-commerce competitors such as Stitch Fix to carve out a niche in the online retail space.

<strong>Amazon is taking on Pinterest: Is your brand ready?</strong>

Though Amazon has previously attempted to update their browsing experience with <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/28/amazon-expands-its-online-gift-shop-interesting-finds-adds-human-curation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">additional curating or personalization,</a> Scout seems to be a broader-focused (and possibly more significant) development. With Scout and Alexa, Amazon hopes to gently guide consumers away from traditional modes of product search into something that's deeply-informed by their own data and preferences. Amazon's vast library of visual imagery and a treasure trove of data should make Scout one of the more-powerful recommendation engines of its kind.

Given the critical importance Amazon holds for today's brands, it's a smart idea to pay close attention to Scout's rollout. This means studying how the recommendation algorithm works, discerning patterns and then optimizing (for image quality and other variables) whenever possible.

At the moment, Scout's usefulness seems somewhat limited, as the algorithm tends to frequently deliver repeat suggestions. Yet as with any machine learning tool, Scout's performance should improve with use, as more data is collected.

Scout represents the next phase of Amazon's larger plan to create a more personalized and social shopping experience, and as such, brands should make every effort to leverage this development for their own benefit.

We are ready to help you make that happen.

5 Secrets to authentic branding in an era of declining trust,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A generation ago, authenticity perhaps wasn't a <em>key</em> strategic goal for your typical marketing firm or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story agency.</a> That's not because it isn't important; it's simply because yesterday's audience was less wary and more trusting.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Survey after survey shows that Millennials and Generation Z are more skeptical of ads than older demographics. This development is occurring against a backdrop of declining trust in business --<a href=""https://www.edelman.com/trust-barometer"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2""> the Edelman Trust Barometer</span></a> reports that 48% of U.S. citizens report having trust in corporations. That's a relatively steep decline of 10 points since 2017.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Not only are modern audiences more skeptical and less likely to automatically trust, but they are also more sophisticated and discerning. In an age where data is currency, people are beginning to take a closer look at how advertising and marketing work -- and who truly benefits. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The environment makes authenticity essential. Brands and any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story agency</a> that can connect in a meaningful way have a serious competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With that in mind, let's review five ways you can <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/""><span class=""s3"">authentically brand</span></a> your company and improve your marketing strategy.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Fearless candor</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Remember when Domino's Pizza essentially <a href=""https://news.avclub.com/the-story-behind-domino-s-we-re-sorry-for-sucking-cam-1798259162"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">admitted their product was awful?</span></a> In the early 2000s, the pizza chain's reputation was so toxic that taste testers liked their product less if they were told it came from Domino's, rather than simply being unbranded.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Domino's decided to make changes to their pizza and accompany the rollout with a marketing campaign that was basically <a href=""https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-dominos-pizza-reinvented-itself"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">an extended mea culpa </span></a>for culinary crimes. This candid and authentic approach was a resounding success; Domino's market share rose from nine to 16% in five years. The moral of the story? The honesty and candor resonated with consumers, and they ordered much more pizza as a result.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Fine tune your voice</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Does your company speak with a unified and distinctive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand voice</a> across all platforms and channels? If not, it's time to start working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story agency.</a> Your brand voice should be an authentic representation of your brand personality and it should, ideally, be immediately recognizable to your audience.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">What's the best way to create an authentic brand voice? Fine-tune your language. All of your brand language should reflect your <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/""><span class=""s3"">brand messaging</span></a>, attributes etc. It should also be relatable, fresh and up to date.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">What it shouldn't do, however, is attempt to mimic popular slang phrases or idioms. That kind of thing needs to be executed perfectly, otherwise, you'll fall into the all too familiar category ""corporation tries to be hip and fails spectacularly."" That's about as inauthentic as it gets in the eyes of modern audiences.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Reach for a higher purpose</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Consumers may be wary about marketing, but they appreciate uplift and storytelling. Look no further than <a href=""https://qz.com/1400583/modern-corporate-social-activism-looks-like-nikes-kaepernick-ad/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Nike's advertising campaigns,</span></a> which typically do a masterful job of highlighting the triumph of the human spirit over often-incredible odds.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When an audience <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BziMwOc1R68"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">watches Rohan Murphy </span></a>(a wrestler who managed to compete at the highest collegiate level despite having no legs) in a Nike ad, some of the awe and goodwill they experience is transferred to the brand.  Being exposed to a narrative like this can create a deeply human and authentic connection, as the ad creates a powerful emotional response in the viewer.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Forge a two-way connection</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Great <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">storytelling</a> doesn't have to be a one-way street. In fact, by encouraging your audience to share their own stories with your brand, you can forge an even deeper and more authentic connection.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">Social media</a> is the ideal avenue for a two-way campaign. Invite your audience to share photos or stories on Instagram, and engage them in meaningful conversations about their content.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Don't behave like a brand; Act like a person</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let's face it: Brands are never going to fully transcend the inherent skepticism audience’s hold. So why act like a brand?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you want to achieve authenticity, don't be afraid to let the corporate mask drop. Show the occasional misstep or hiccup. Work with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story agency</a> to create interesting, fresh and human stories to share. Drop the pose of corporate Olympian detachment, and let your audience know that your brand is really a collection of people: Imperfect, yes, but also human and deeply authentic.</span></p>

Amazon's Alexa just powered up - here's what marketers need to know,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice technology</a> continues to surge in terms of adoption, with global smart speaker sales <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2018/08/16/canalys-smart-speaker-market-grew-187-percent-in-q2-2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">up 187% </span></a>in 2018's second quarter. The world’s largest manufacturers collectively shipped nearly 17 million voice technology devices in the second quarter, up from roughly 9 million units in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These numbers are evidence of an ongoing shift from touch to voice as the default manner by which we access connected devices. Someday soon, the idea of navigating through daily life by tapping on a smartphone screen may seem as quaint as visiting the neighborhood video rental store.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This has massive implications for advertisers and marketers, of course -- and one of the best ways to capitalize on this is the effective use of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Alexa Skill programming.</a></span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">Evolving from basic Skills to a nearly limitless future</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While Alexa’s current Skills are geared toward basic topics and operations, new tools are being released that will profoundly expand the powers of Amazon’s smart speakers.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The company recently staged its <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/get-ready-for-some-new-amazon-hardware/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">Amazon Fall Device Announcement Event </span></a>in Seattle, rolling out more than 70 new devices and developer tools.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let’s take a closer look at some of the most relevant of these new voice products, features, and tools debuted out in September:</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">Next generation Echo devices</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The third generation Echo Dot gets a redesign and better sound, while the second generation Echo Show features improved sound and a larger display. The second generation Echo Plus allows consumers to automatically discover and set up connected lights, locks and plugs with a simple voice command.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">New Echo companion devices</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Echo Input, Echo Sub and Echo Link allows Alexa to be added to existing speakers and enables direct streaming from high fidelity stereo systems.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">Echo On-the-Go</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Alexa can now go mobile, as On-the-Go allows users to add her to their car or truck.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">New Alexa features</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Along with new products and new product iterations, Alexa is getting smarter and more powerful. New features include guided cooking, email, Skype and streaming music integration, plus smart home and security features.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">Added developer tools</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Amazon has introduced a new developer language (Amazon Presentation Language) that is designed to help integrate voice with visuals. The company also introduced the fourth iteration of their Smart Home API and Alexa Connect Kit.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Amazon's decision to focus on adding a visual component to its voice technology devices is telling. The company is attempting to improve the user experience and make <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/""><span class=""s3"">voice technology</span></a> more accessible. Along with new hardware devices, the introduction of Amazon Presentation Language will give developers one more powerful tool in their arsenal.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the coming years, Alexa's capabilities will grow exponentially as she transitions from fulfilling basic and relatively straightforward tasks to handling more advanced processes. Alexa's cloud-based machine learning capabilities ensure that she grows smarter over time, improving in understanding and natural language processing and accuracy. Amazon's goal is to have Alexa tightly integrated into consumer life, both at home and in commercial settings. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In terms of marketing, the introduction of new devices, features and Alexa Skill programming tools is an exciting development. As Skills grow more refined and powerful, they will become competitive in terms of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience reach</a> with smartphone applications. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Savvy brands will stay at the vanguard of the shift to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a>, using Alexa Skills to sell, market products and services, and deepen engagement with their audiences.</span></p>

Ride the silver tsunami wave with 3 senior living marketing secrets,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's hard to imagine members of the ""Woodstock generation"" moving into senior living communities for a life of quiet reflection punctuated by the occasional game of 4 p.m. shuffleboard. That's one reason why these communities are undergoing a significant transformation. Today's older generation have new priorities -- and your senior living marketing needs to keep pace if you want to remain competitive. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The ""silver tsunami"" of aging Baby Boomers has helped redefine the senior living experience. Much as modern workplaces are working overtime to integrate Millennials and members of Generation Z, senior living communities must also align their offerings (and their marketing) with the needs and wants of the Baby Boomer demographic.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With that in mind, we're sharing three secrets for successful senior living <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com"">marketing</a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">1. Target changing priorities</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We often hear how Millennials prize walkable neighborhoods when buying real estate. What we don't hear quite so often is how <a href=""https://www.curbed.com/2017/7/25/16025388/senior-living-walkability-survey"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">seniors desire the same thing.</span></a> Walkability consistently ranks near the top of desired traits in senior communities, according to surveys.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Why is walkability so important? Because today's seniors are living longer and staying healthier. This means they stay much healthier than past generations and want to remain active. Walkability and other desired features (such as low crime and access to public transit) should be stressed whenever possible in senior living marketing.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">2. Market to the whole family</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The decision to move into a new living community is a significant one. As such, it's often a family affair. Adult children may exert a strong influence on the decisions seniors make (or even make that decision for them).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This means that it's important for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">marketing to target</a> both seniors and their adult children. These groups may have slightly different perspectives on the process. Seniors will naturally be focused on the amenities and culture of the community, as they will be the ones living there. Adult children, on the other hand, will likely want lots of information about the reputation of the facility, financial arrangements, transitional issues etc.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A smart senior living marketing campaign takes both perspectives into consideration.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">3. Breakthrough the clichés</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Think for a moment about your typical senior living marketing campaign -- you're probably visualizing a well-dressed older couple walking, playing games or feeding ducks while elevator music trills in the background. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That may have worked for previous generations, but after experiencing the counterculture of the 1960s Baby Boomers aren't likely to be impressed. Instead, show real images of community life accompanied by <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/""><span class=""s3"">cutting-edge marketing techniques</span></a>. Produce a behind the scenes video; use social media platforms; incorporate augmented reality, live video or gamification.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you think the new generation of seniors are too out of touch with technology to respond to this approach, think again. Although this demographic is less digitally connected than younger groups, the size of that gap <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">is shrinking fast</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Think of it like this: The cultural gulf between a 60-year-old and a 20-year-old was enormous a few generations ago. Today, that gulf is but a slight crack in many cases -- and this should inform how you market to seniors.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Today's seniors have a new set of priorities and have redefined notions of what the ""golden years"" should entail. In short, they want to be active, connected and be a part of the conversation. They don't want the senior living experience their parents had.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">By following the ideas outlined above, your senior living marketing campaign will in tune with those new ideas -- and more successful as a result.</span></p>

Meet Spot: Amazon's solution to enhancing voice & video technologies,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If software is really ""eating the world,"" no company is more likely to come down with a vicious case of indigestion than Amazon. In just a couple of decades, the company has redefined the experience of shopping, transformed office life via Amazon Web Services and introduced us to Alexa -- their friendly, helpful voice assistant. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A casual observer might say the creation of Alexa -- as popular as she is -- is somewhat inconsequential for a company that helped reinvent shopping and working. </span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Amazon is working to make <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/""><span class=""s2"">voice technology</span></a> an indispensable part of our daily lives by following a two-pronged<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/""> strategy</a>: Improving Alexa's underlying software to make her more powerful and life-like, with also rolling out a plethora of new Alexa-equipped hardware devices, each designed to fulfill a specific role.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One example: The <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16378472/amazons-echo-spot-camera-in-your-bedroom"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">Amazon Spot </span></a>-- a compact, Alexa-equipped device with added features made possible through the touchscreen. While it might first appear to be a simple, whimsical looking home device, the Spot has much more going on under the surface -- and it starts with a concept called machine vision.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Echo Spot uses artificial intelligence-equipped video and voice processing to allow Alexa to better understand the surrounding environment. By merging voice with visuals, Alexa can use her facial recognition capabilities to perform tasks such as adjusting room temperatures, alerting you when friends or packages arrive at the door or guide you through custom recipes.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At its recent hardware rollout in September, Amazon debuted more than a dozen new products and product upgrades, most of which came equipped with Alexa. The tech giant seems intent about deploying Alexa's capabilities in every possible device -- not only in our homes but also <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/amazon-event-takeaways/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">in our vehicles </span></a>as well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Amazon's push to make Alexa omnipresent in our daily lives is no big strategic secret. In a recent company earnings call, Amazon hinted that Alexa would be a key growth driver in the years ahead, not merely in e-commerce, but in digital streaming services and other channels.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">A new paradigm</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The debut of the iPhone seems like a seminal event in retrospect, but at the time it left some observers <a href=""https://bgr.com/2016/07/01/iphone-reviews-original-negative-ballmer-dvorak/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">decidedly underwhelmed </span></a>-- a TechCrunch review even predicted the iPhone would ""bomb"" because consumers would hate the now-revolutionary touchscreen design.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We can't judge these early misapprehensions too harshly, however -- it's often difficult to grasp paradigm-shifting technology in its early stages. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice technology</a> is developing along the same curve. At first, these devices seemed to be a useful but hardly essential household luxury. As the technology grows more powerful, however, the true nature of this shift will become apparent. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Voice app development</a> and new hardware devices such as Amazon Spot will make the technology more accessible, easier to use and, ultimately, harder to live without -- and that's something that should draw the attention of every marketer.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Much as the notion of carrying a tiny computer that's integrated into every aspect of your life would have seemed far-fetched as late as the year 2000, replacing the conventional smartphone with advanced voice assistants (in hundreds or thousands of different forms) today seems remarkable.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Soon, however, Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant will be our constant companions, ready to help execute an almost limitless series of tasks with great efficiency and precision. The maturation of the underlying machine learning technology -- and countless new skills being added through voice app development -- will help speed this process.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While voice assistant-enabled commercial transactions may be a novelty for many today, they will soon become commonplace. This means that brands that begin deploying <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice technology</a> at this (still early) stage will carve out a significant edge in the voice and visual ecosystem.</span></p>

Everything you need to know about Facebook's rebranded Canvas ads,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For Facebook, 2018 hasn't been smooth sailing.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unfortunately for the company, the Cambridge Analytical scandal shined an unflattering light on the company's privacy protocols. While younger users continue to use the platform numbers are definitely lower. A <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/01/carolyn-everson-facebook-hack-was-a-sophisticated-attack.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">recent hack</span></a> may have exposed the personal details of 50 million people and the company's stock price has lagged.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Yet -- if you're a practitioner of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">digital marketing</a> -- you have plenty of reasons to remain interested in the Facebook platform.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And Canvas ads (or ""Instant Experiences"") is one of those reasons.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">A mobile website experience in miniature</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Facebook Canvas, which debuted in 2016, represented another step in the company's attempt to capitalize on mobile, bringing full-screen ads to smartphones. Historically, brands had struggled to weave compelling stories across the small screen, given the technical restraints. This presented a serious challenge when mobile, in a matter of just a few years, became the preferred method for consuming content.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Canvas helped square this circle by optimizing ads for mobile, allowing them to load faster and flow properly. Brands could create deeply immersive, full-screen ads geared for mobile that could be opened by clicking on ads inside a news feed. Within a created Canvas, users could swipe through a carousel of images, tilt panoramic shots and zoom at the touch of a button. A Canvas offered a website experience in miniature, with ads claiming full use of all screen space.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">But what about those recent changes?</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Facebook recently introduced changes to Canvas, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/news/bring-brands-and-products-to-life-with-instant-experience"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">beginning with a new name.</span></a> The ads are now called ""Instant Experiences,"" a name that Facebook says has more ""zing"" and better communicates the overall idea.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The use of ""instant"" makes sense -- these ads now load 15 times faster than your average mobile site, thanks to Facebook's in-house technology. This, of course, is critical in terms of digital marketing. Few people like to wait for their favorite mobile websites to load; nobody wants to wait for ad content to load. In order to facilitate a positive audience experience, the process must be seamless. Instant Experiences now load about 50% faster than a Canvas did in 2016.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The process of creating an Instant Experience has undergone some minor changes as well. In order to create an ad, a template is selected, which means that little technical skill is required.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Along with faster speeds and a rebranded name, Facebook has also rolled out a new template for Instant Experiences. Currently, these templates include:</span></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">Instant storefront (for selling products in a grid)</span></li>
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">Instant customer acquisition (which includes a call to action)</span></li>
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">Instant lookbook (which displays ad in a lifestyle context)</span></li>
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">Instant storytelling (which uses video to craft a narrative)</span></li>
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">Instant form (which allows audiences to quickly share information)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All of these templates are available on both the Facebook and Instagram platforms.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One more change to note: Brands can now integrate<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/news/bring-brands-and-products-to-life-with-instant-experience"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2""> the Facebook Pixel </span></a>into their Instant Experiences in order to access more detailed data about how Instant Experiences influence buying decisions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Pixel is automatically added to all Instant Experiences and serves as an easy method for allowing brands to track and follow up with customers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Facebook Instant Experiences are an impactful digital marketing tool, particularly for brands seeking to improve their mobile ad offerings. The presence of easy-to-use templates helps to make the process seamless and intuitive for those with limited technical skill. </span></p>

"OTT, you know me! Jump into cross-channel advertising","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Television and film content has been migrating online at a rapid rate. Most of us use platforms such as Hulu, Amazon Video and Netflix daily-- if not hourly. Popular streaming services such as these are generally referred to as OTT (or ""Over-the-Top"") media.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The idea behind OTT is simple: Instead of a conventional set-top box, audiences simply stream their favorite content directly from a provider's app. This, in some cases, eliminates the need for a cable or satellite company to act as a content distributor. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overall, the transition to OTT has made the process of watching our favorite programming easier and more accessible than ever before. We can open a mobile device, fire up an app and stream content anywhere at any time -- a shift that has a multitude of significant implications for marketers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Why OTT is essential for cross-channel marketing campaigns</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Studies have long illustrated the utility of a cross-channel advertising approach: One survey found that <a href=""https://mashable.com/2012/03/05/future-digital-marketing-trends/#puIQt4mG5mqw"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">72% of consumers </span></a>prefer an integrated marketing approach across all channels. Meanwhile, Google discovered that consumers displayed better brand recall during cross-channel campaigns (74%). </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So this much is clear: A cross-channel approach not only works better, it's the campaign format that audiences find most useful. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Here's another important statistic: Roughly three out of four people consume OTT content, and the number of OTT-only households <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/the-number-of-ott-only-u-s-homes-has-tripled-over-the-last-5-years/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s2"">has tripled </span></a>over the last five years. Additionally, one-third of OTT consumers watch content on three or more devices.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Some other eye-opening OTT numbers:</span></strong></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">The four largest OTT services (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and YouTube) average a total of nearly two hours of viewing time per day in every U.S. household.</span></li>
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">Streaming accounts for 11% of all TV viewing in the 18 to 49 demographic - an increase of more than 100% in the last three years.</span></li>
 	<li class=""li3""><span class=""s4"">Netflix accounts for the lion's share of OTT consumption (40%). YouTube is second with 18%; Hulu 14% and Amazon 7%.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Given these numbers, determining the optimal approach for marketing in the OTT ecosystem should be a key consideration moving forward. According to a recent Video Advertising Bureau report, 65% of people who use a second screen when watching OTT content have researched products or services they've seen advertised on the programming they are watching.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This kind of multitasking is a boon for advertisers and marketers, and the future possibilities for <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/""><span class=""s5"">integrated marketing</span></a> are profound. A generation or two ago, advertisers were forced to take a scattershot approach to reach audiences. Market research and notoriously unreliable TV ratings were the tools of the trade, and the only real methods available for creating targeted ads over a TV set.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Today, advanced data analytics have allowed the process of ad targeting to make a quantum leap in effectiveness. The general trend toward OTT consumption enables even more precise targeting, as OTT content is streamed across devices and apps that often know more about our history and preferences than we do ourselves.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">OTT allows advertisers a deep level of control; they pick who sees an ad, the device it's on and when it shows. They can track which ads are skipped, which ads are watched and the overall preferences of viewers.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Incorporating OTT advertising into a campaign isn't without challenges, however. Advertisers, for example, need to create ads that are optimized for myriad screen sizes, browsers, platforms etc.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Yet the truth is fairly simple: Audiences want cross-channel advertising, and they want content streamed Over-the-Top.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's the job of marketers and advertisers to give it to them.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The numbers tell the story: OTT viewing is experiencing explosive growth, and will eventually become the default content viewing experience for most audiences. The data-rich OTT ecosystem is also fertile ground for the kind of highly-targeted <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">cross-channel advertising</a> that moves the needle.</span></p>

Why building a fence is the best recipe for restaurant success,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Marketers and advertisers have always sought new and better ways to understand and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/""><span class=""s2"">target their audience</span></a>. If you can do this well, your odds of success increase exponentially.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Technological tools have revolutionized this process, giving us unprecedented insight into who our audiences are, and ultimately lead to how we can best identify and reach them.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And for restaurants, few of these techniques are more relevant than <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/09/26/10-digital-marketing-trends-every-entrepreneur-should-watch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">geofencing.</span></a></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Build the fence, and the customers will come.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">Geofencing explained</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The premise behind geofencing is simple: Businesses can specifically advertise to people who are within a specific geographical area. By using certain technologies, a boundary is created, and everyone within that boundary serves as the target audience.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So how does it work? Geofencing uses well-established location-based technologies, including GPS and Bluetooth, to identify people within a certain area and communicate with them. While the technology isn't new, it has come to play an important role in marketing and advertising because of another invention -- the smartphone.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The technology is particularly useful for businesses <a href=""https://www.qsrmagazine.com/outside-insights/modern-marketing-strategies-restaurant-success"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">such as restaurants</span></a>. Your typical example of restaurant geofencing would feature an eating establishment creating <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/""><span class=""s2"">marketing material</span></a> (for instance, a limited-time coupon) and sending it to everyone within a specified geographical boundary via their mobile device. As soon as someone enters the specified virtual boundary, the coupon is transmitted via push notification.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let's take a look at how this works in closer detail. A restaurant proprietor wants to generate more walk-in foot traffic. Instead of relying on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/""><span class=""s2"">signage or offsite advertising</span></a>, she employs restaurant geofencing to create a virtual boundary around the establishment. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When people carrying smartphones enter the boundary, they automatically receive a coupon for a free appetizer that expires in sixty minutes. Because the recipients are already in close proximity to the restaurant (and because people are biologically programmed to respond to feelings of urgency), they are much more likely to redeem the limited time offer.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Restaurants can also choose to switch up the offers on a daily (or even hourly) basis, responding to changing conditions inside the establishment. If a restaurant has a shipment of pricey and fast-perishing bluefin tuna to sell, it's a simple task to create a special offer and send out a new push notification within the geofence.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's also a great idea to be flexible and use geofencing to capitalize on changing conditions outside the restaurant. If the weather is gorgeous, send out a push notification and remind everyone about your beautiful outdoor seating area.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">The benefits of restaurant geofencing</span><span class=""s4""> </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We've discussed the positive effect restaurant geofencing can have on sales through location-based targeting. Yet geofencing provides a few other benefits, including the ability to collect more data.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When customers redeem geofenced coupons or offers, restaurants can track other metrics, including the amount of time spent inside the restaurant, the level of repeat business and the type of food and drinks ordered.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Restaurants can also use data gathered to create more highly targeted and personalized promotions, something that should improve the diner experience and lead to lots of repeat business. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s1"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ultimately, restaurant geofencing can be a highly useful tool that helps establishments better understand the demographics of the area and the preferences and behavior of those inside.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">While that's a recipe for success, it's also important that you lay the proper groundwork for your geofencing campaign. That means encouraging people to download your smartphone app (geofencing works via app, after all) and setting a reasonable boundary. You can experiment with distances, but it's generally recommended to stay within a mile or two for maximum foot traffic. </span></p>

Hacktober: Why social media networks can't keep you digitally safe,"If a social network shuts down -- but nobody's on it -- does it make a sound?

In the case of Google Plus, the answer is ""yes"" -- and that sound you're hearing is outrage about subpar security practices.

Given its paltry user numbers, Google's decision to shutter its little-loved Google Plus social network was hardly surprising. Yet Google Plus' status as a digital ghost town appeared to be only part of the search giant's rationale for the closing. The company admitted a security bug may have caused <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90248177/google-admits-to-potential-google-data-leak-after-getting-caught"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">500,000 Google Plus accounts</a> to be breached.

Although Google discovered the leak in March 2018, they initially decided against public disclosure -- a move that may have them in hot water with <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-data-irish-regulators/irish-data-regulator-seeks-information-from-google-on-security-bug-idUSKCN1MJ1M0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">regulators across the globe</a>. With new and vastly tougher consumer data privacy laws now in effect in the European Union, businesses are contending with greater scrutiny at a time when hacks continue to surge to all-time highs.

In other words, October has now become ""Hacktober.""

<strong>Staying digitally safer on smartphones, social and search</strong>

Google is, of course, no outlier when it comes to security issues. Fresh of the massive Cambridge Analytical scandal, Facebook is now struggling with yet another hack, one that has exposed data associated with tens of millions of accounts. Facebook, too, is under the withering gaze of regulators and could face a fine in excess of <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/facebook-data-breach-social-network-could-face-eu-fine.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a billion dollars</a>.

If sophisticated, innovative companies such as Google and Facebook can't keep your information secure, then no third party is safe. Responsibility for digitally safe storage of personal information on social media and in the cloud is incumbent on users.

With that in mind, let's take a closer look at some security tips you can use to help keep your data as digitally safe as possible.

<strong>Upgrade to IoS</strong><strong> 12 </strong>

Smartphones are our primary conduit to the digital world. As such, they need to be zealously protected. If you're an iPhone owner, updating to the latest version of the IoS operating system is one of the simplest things you can do to protect your data.

The new update offers some very <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/5-security-and-privacy-features-in-ios-12-you-should-know-about/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">useful security features</a>, including the ability to create longer passcodes and a built-in password manager that makes creating and using multiple passwords much easier.

IoS 12 also has a new <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/the-best-security-and-privacy-features-in-ios-12-and-macos-mojave/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">USB restricted feature</a> that allows you to prevent cords, cables, and other accessories from accessing your phone and stealing your data.

<strong>Two-factor authentication</strong>
This is the gold standard for security. If you're not using <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/09/instagram-app-2fa-available/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">two-factor authentication</a> to secure your log-in information and other data, you're making it vastly easier for hackers to compromise your account.

Two-factor authentication works by requiring you to punch in a six-digit numerical code along with your password when you access websites, apps, and accounts. These codes are typically generated by an app (such as Google Authenticator) or via an SMS text message, though the latter option is much less secure.

<strong>Smart social sharing</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/"">Social media</a> isn't just a goldmine for digital advertisers; it's also a treasure trove for hackers. The personal information we share over social networks often makes breaching an account trivially easy.

To avoid this, be very careful with what you share. Make sure your account settings are secure ones. Don't accept friend requests from questionable sources. Never click links you're unsure about -- and always use different passwords for different platforms.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

With new security breaches popping up seemingly every day, ""Hacktober"" is a reality. We strongly encourage you to follow the suggestions outlined above to stay as safe and secure as possible this fall season.

Fail to do so, and you run a serious risk of financial losses, reputational harm, and other serious problems. <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact our team</a> of social media &amp; digital experts today to make sure your information is safe and secure online!",,10/16/2018 21:59,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hacktober-Why-social-media-networks-cant-keep-you-digitally-safe.jpg,hacktober-why-social-media-networks-cant-keep-you-digitally-safe,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Determining your marketing budget sweet spot for the new fiscal year,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In t</span><span class=""s2"">he world of high technology, you'll sometimes hear about a line being drawn between those who make and those who sell.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">The implication, of course, is that those who make require more talent than those who sell. Upon even the swiftest examination, however, that argument falls to pieces. After all, Steve Jobs wasn't a coder. He didn't build things.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">But, he had a genius for defining what people wanted -- usually before they were even aware that they harbored such desires. He knew what resonated; what made an audience see a product and feel ""that's me -- I'm the kind of person who owns this.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">In other words, he knew marketing.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s2"">Marketing and advertising spend: By the numbers</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">It hasn't always been easy to quantify the effect of a marketing or ad campaign. With today's advanced analytics and metrics, however, that task has grown much easier.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Determining the right percentage to budget toward marketing and advertising is another question that many small to mid-sized firms wrestle with. For the most prominent enterprises, the numbers are impressive: The top 200 largest spenders were <a href=""https://adage.com/article/news/amazon-4-advertiser-marketer-facts/313980/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">responsible for $155 billion </span></a>in ad and marketing expenditures in 2017. Amazon alone spent $3.4 billion in 2017 on ads and marketing promotions. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">According to research from Deloitte and the Wall Street Journal, marketing budgets comprise </span><span class=""s3"">about 11% </span><span class=""s2"">of the total company budget for the average firm, though the level of spending varies by industry. This means that for smaller companies, the process of determining a marketing budget figure should also be influenced by the sector in which a business operates. The disparities between industries can be fairly stark.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Consider the following industry averages for marketing as a percentage of the total budget:</span></p>

<ul class=""ul1"">
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s2"">Consumer packaged goods: 24%</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s2"">Technology: 15%</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s2"">Communications/Media: 13%</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s2"">Retail: 10%</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s2"">Banking: 8%</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s2"">Manufacturing: 8%</span></li>
 	<li class=""li1""><span class=""s2"">Energy: 4%</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">So, what's driving these budgetary decisions? According to the research, nearly 40% of companies identify marketing as the leading revenue growth driver. Companies that report marketing as being primarily responsible for revenue growth dedicate 14.5% of their total budget to marketing. Firms that do not identify marketing as the leading growth driver average around 10%.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Interestingly enough, companies that integrate marketing analytics into their decision-making have marketing budgets that are 70% higher than those of companies that do not -- perhaps an indication that analytics are helping companies get a better grasp on marketing campaign ROI.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s2"">Finding the budgetary sweet spot</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">If you have a small to mid-sized firm, you've probably heard that 10% of revenue is a common yardstick for marketing spending. Larger firms spend a bit more, smaller firms a bit less. There are also <a href=""https://www.business2community.com/marketing/what-percentage-of-total-revenue-is-spent-on-marketing-02127930"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">other models </span></a>you can use to arrive at a figure.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">As the data shows, however, it's critically important to consider the industry in which you're operating. Spending varies widely among industries, and the more ""consumer-facing"" a sector is, the greater the need for marketing and advertising.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Product or service type also plays a role. Companies with a strongly differentiated (or patented) product or service and a deep competitive moat may not need to rely on marketing and advertising to the same degree.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">The size of the business -- and the growth stage -- also need to be considered. The Small Business Administration suggests that firms with under $5 million in revenue should allocate around <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/blogs/how-set-marketing-budget-fits-your-business-goals-and-provides-high-return-investment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span class=""s3"">7 to 8% </span></a>of these revenues to marketing. If you're a retail business in the early brand-building stage, however, spending 20% of sales on marketing is typical.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">All of these figures should be taken simply as a rough estimate, as there is no universal method for building a company. Many of today's fastest-growing technology firms, for example, devote 30 or even 40% of their revenue into marketing.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><span class=""s2"">The takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">With the beginning of a new fiscal year, now is the ideal time for businesses to examine their marketing spend. Given broader industry trends, improved data analytics and the link we've seen between higher marketing spending and growth, it might be the perfect time to experiment with a more substantial marketing budget.</span></p>

A brand positioning agency changed how America eats burritos,"For years, Taco Bell had something close to a monopoly on fast Tex-Mex food. The menu certainly wasn't gourmet -- or even particularly good for you -- but the company was resoundingly successful.

And then Chipotle came along.

Though it began as a small operation in Denver in the 1990s, Chipotle expanded fast, thanks in part to its pioneering ""fast casual"" approach. That was merely the prelude for one of the most extraordinary growth stories in the archives of the food business -- a success story that was driven by just one partnership.

A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning agency</a>.

<strong>How brilliant brand positioning helped ""Burrito David"" challenge ""Taco Goliath""</strong>

In a little more than a decade, Chipotle grew from a modest local Colorado burrito shop to a billion-dollar enterprise with 500 locations. Not only was the company continuously listed among the fastest-growing businesses in the United States, but it was also applauded for the quality and flavor of its products.

The truth, however, is that Chipotle didn't invent its famous overstuffed ""mission-style"" burrito, a delicacy Californians have enjoyed since the 1960s. They did, however, build one of the restaurant industry's most effective brand campaigns around their fast-casual offerings.

Taco Bell, which owned virtually all of the national fast-food Tex-Mex market, didn't focus its marketing on food quality, eating experience or health. Instead, Taco Bell ran a multi-year ad campaign detailing the madcap adventures of a taco-crazed Chihuahua.

While ""Yo queiro Taco Bell"" was certainly clever and cute, it also wasn't in tune with the ever-evolving consumer attitudes and preferences. Cheap, fast food of dubious quality was out -- and cleaner, healthier, better-tasting dishes served in brighter and sleeker settings was in.

<a href=""https://www.figmints.com/blog/5-companies-that-differentiated-in-crowded-markets-with-brand-strategy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Chipotle's marketing</a> capitalized on this trend by printing clever jokes on its cups and cultivating a hip environment in its restaurant locations. Their marketing campaigns ruthlessly highlighted the differences between Chipotle's approach and that of Taco Bell. They made the case that not only was Chipotle higher quality it was also operating on a higher ethical plane.

One example: Chipotle commissioned a <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/228389"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">stop-motion short film</a> that promoted organic, sustainable farming (and their own superior ingredients), set to a soundtrack of Willie Nelson covering Coldplay.

Later, in advance of Halloween, they released a Tim Burton-style short film that starred a scarecrow in moral conflict about the (very tangential) role he was playing in factory farming. The video, which was set to Fiona Apple covering a song from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" was also tied into a mobile gaming app with an anti-factory farming message.

These clever creative gambits helped position Chipotle as a fast-casual cuisine that you could feel good about eating. Not only was it elevated above the déclassé level of fast food, but it was also smart, ethical and in tune with changing tastes.

Though the company eventually had to deal with some turbulence caused by food-borne illnesses, <a href=""https://www.qsrmagazine.com/finance/next-big-challenge-chipotles-comeback"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sales are up</a>, and Chipotle's future is looking brighter than ever.

This is the kind of powerful brand positioning that can shake up an industry. In Chipotle's case, it helped the company become a global juggernaut and the first serious rival to Taco Bell's Tex-Mex hegemony.

<strong>What the right brand positioning agency can do for you</strong>

Even though the company has had some <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/chipotles-new-menu-how-good-marketing-trumps-bad-queso/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent, queso-related missteps</a>, Chipotle has always been a favorite at the BIGEYE offices, and it's not just the bowls and burritos. We've loved their story, and you should too.

A star is rebranded: What your business can learn from Lady Gaga,"Rebranding...it's not just for businesses.

Look no further than the example of Stefani Germanotta, better known as ""Lady Gaga."" Fans know that Gaga has reinvented herself numerous times in a musical context: She began as a neo-burlesque club act and New York cult sensation, before exploding onto the scene as a world-conquering, meat suit wearing, dance music pop star.

After pushing the conceptual art boundary as far as it could go, Gaga shapeshifted into a rootsier<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/20/lady-gaga-joanne-review-stefani-germanotta"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">, rock-heavy persona</a> that saw her minimize the glam and artifice in favor of a more personal approach to her craft and her presentation.

None of those transformations hold a candle to Gaga's latest rebranding, however: Full-fledged, Oscar-caliber A-list actress.

<strong>Rebranding on the big screen</strong>

Gaga isn't completely new to acting. Her credits, in fact, stretch back 15 years, all the way to a bit part in an early episode of ""The Soprano's."" She's also taken a starring role in the popular <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/lady-gaga-acting-star-is-born-american-horror-story-1202010283/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""American Horror Story"" TV series</a>.

All told, she has 40 credits to her name on TV and film. However, there is a major caveat: Almost all of those appearances were tied into her musical persona, and none of them featured a performance quite like her leading role in ""A Star is Born.""

Gaga has drawn rave reviews (and likely Oscar notices) for her role as Ally, a diamond-in-the-rough singing waitress who eventually climbs to the top of the record industry after being discovered by co-star Bradley Cooper's famous yet troubled troubadour.

Though she's drawn critical raves for a performance that marries powerful acting with showstopping singing, landing this role was only the first step in Gaga's most recent -- and most impressive -- rebranding.  She isn't content to merely arrive on the scene as an Oscar-contending actor.

As a recent <u>New York Times Magazine profile</u> makes clear, Gaga is playing a much bigger role -- that of a screen siren from Hollywood's Golden Age.

Marilyn-inspired look featuring platinum blond hair and stilettos? Check.

Arriving at the 2018 Venice Film Festival on a sailboat with one red rose in hand? Check.

Buying a mansion in the Hollywood Hills? Check.

Given that it's grounded in a remarkably powerful performance, Gaga doesn't so much play this role as inhabit it. It's also fair to say that -- even for a master of transformations and reinventions -- this represents her boldest and most successful rebrand yet.

<strong>Taking a page from Lady Gaga’s branding story</strong>

Lady Gaga has a special genius for fusing styles, identities, and dexterously remixing the ideas and images of other famous artists (Madonna, David Bowie and David Byrne to name just a few).

Brands don't have access to Gaga's creative brilliance, but they can still learn important lessons about audience building, rebranding, and utilizing resources, such as a branding agency.

One example: Gaga's connection with her fans is amazingly deep and powerful. In an era where fame is often fleeting and fickle, Gaga has built a global fan base numbering in the tens of millions. Her art isn't solely responsible for this connection; Gaga is a master of using social media and other digital forms to interact and communicate with her fan base.

Gaga’s most ardent followers, whom she christened ""Little Monsters,"" are among the most passionate and devoted fans in the world. In every corner of the digital world, you'll find them evangelizing on her behalf, defending her from critics and reveling in all things Gaga. In return, Lady Gaga showers them with affection, interacts with them personally across social platforms, and gives them exclusive access to songs and information.

Why is there such a fierce bond between this superstar and her fans? It's the same reason why her rebranding efforts have been successful: Authenticity. Anyone (or any brand) can pivot on a dime; yet if this transformation isn't grounded in something deep, real and true, fans (or consumers) aren't going to respond.

Lady Gaga's rebrand as Hollywood screen siren is rooted in her Oscar-worthy performance.  Her previous transformations and incarnations were all rooted in her deep understanding of the musical and artistic traditions she was mining for inspiration.

For brands seeking to replicate that success, it's a smart idea to follow the same framework: Build a meaningful connection with your audience, and ensure your rebrand is rooted in something authentic.

<strong>Finding the right branding agency</strong>

At BIGEYE, we're big fans of Lady Gaga -- but we're even more entranced by the idea of helping businesses develop their own genius for branding. With some assistance from the right <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">branding agency</a>, we believe almost any business can build the audience it deserves.

How Gap Inc. uses attribution modeling to build direct connections,"Understanding and connecting with an audience on a deep level is the Holy Grail of sorts for most marketers. Businesses with real insight into who their customers are can understand what truly motivates them. Customers, on the other hand, feel better about businesses (and marketing in general) when they feel they are being addressed as an individual, rather than as a group.

<a href=""https://www.business2community.com/marketing/mass-marketing-is-dead-its-all-about-personalization-02133759"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Personalized digital marketing</a> created by the right <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/attribution-modeling-company/"">attribution modeling company</a> is one of the best methods for cultivating that kind of relationship with consumers -- and one of the most interesting examples of that approach is being taken by Gap Inc., the global retailer behind The Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and other brands.

<strong>How Gap Inc. is forging personal connections through advanced technology</strong>

In order to better connect with customers, Gap Inc. <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronikasonsev/2018/10/08/how-gap-inc-personalizes-marketing-to-boost-results/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">tapped into the power of deep data</a> by building an advanced <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing</a> stack centering around a proprietary customer data platform (CDP). By using both first and third party data, the company was able to create an in-depth and unified profile of its customers.

This approach allowed Gap Inc. to target these customers across digital marketing channels with creative and highly tailored ad content. Cutting-edge dynamic content optimization technology was the key to this operation, as it allows ads to be personalized for each customer at the moment of viewing, based on data collected by Gap Inc.

So what's most interesting about the approach is taken by Gap Inc.? First, the company chose to invest in a proprietary CDP, giving them the freedom to build and customize a platform that best suits their needs. Next, Gap Inc. chose to integrate the first party data it already collects with information about customers interests and demographics, allowing them to create a fuller picture of who their audience is and what motivates them.

Finally, Gap Inc. is deploying sophisticated technological tools, similar to that of an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/attribution-modeling-company/"">attribution modeling company</a>, supported by an in-house data science team. Content optimization technology helps deliver ads that are relevant, compelling and wrapped in the appropriate messaging context. Machine learning and AI tools, for example, can optimize the voice in which a marketing message is delivered based on the current mood of the customer.

Gap Inc. also leveraged the power of AI when building its CDP solution. Because the company has tens of millions of customer records, an algorithmic segmentation solution was necessary. The company used AI to create a unified view of its customers across channels and transactions, then deployed a separate AI solution to enable probabilistic customer matching, done in real time. This led to superior match rates and the ability to fine-tune marketing messages on the fly.

<strong>What brands can learn from Gap</strong> <strong>Inc.</strong>

Modern marketing is both an art and a science. The right creative work can move people and spur them into action, but it takes pinpoint distribution to maximize a campaign's value. The Gap Inc.'s development of a proprietary CDP and its forward-thinking integration of AI and machine learning tools are examples of how technology can help brands connect with their audiences on a much deeper level.

Malls are migrating online: E-commerce development defines success,"It's no surprise that so many companies are enamored with the idea of e-commerce. After all, what's more, attractive than the notion of having billions of potential customers just a click away?

Yet potential, in this case, doesn't always meet performance. For far too many companies, their e-commerce strategies simply aren't gaining the necessary traction.

Fortunately, there's a prescription for this particular ailment: Finding the right target audience by embracing social commerce and partnering with an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce development company</a>.

<strong>The rise of the digital storefront</strong>

Snapchat recently <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/snapchat-is-rolling-out-3-new-ecommerce-features/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">announced the rollout</a> of a few new e-commerce features in time for the upcoming holiday season. The company is making its Shoppable Snap ads (previously a pilot project) available to all advertisers through its self-service ad platform.

Businesses can now import their product catalogs to create richer and more detailed ads. Snapchat has also improved its Pixel tool, allowing viewers to see the total number of purchases associated with a campaign. In addition, they announced plans to expand its agency partner list – which is good news for businesses that need help creating e-commerce campaigns on the app.

<a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/snapchat-introduces-shoppable-snap-ads-amping-up-its-ecommerce-offerings/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Shoppable Snap ads</a> have taken one more step in the evolution of the digital storefront. Once, e-commerce was limited to a website, and typically one that people had to search for themselves. Today's e-commerce is occurring in a much more social context. Consumers can scroll through Snapchat, Instagram or Facebook, see a well-integrated ad that piques their interest, then begin the purchase process with the touch of a button.

By lowering friction, the ads deliver higher engagement. Snapchat reported the Shoppable eBay ads received five times more engagement than standard Snapchat ads, while Shoppable ads for Wish.com received an astounding <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/09/27/snapchat-rolls-out-self-serve-shoppable-ads-globally"">17 times more engagement</a> -- numbers that should make any e-commerce retailer pay attention.

Shoppable ads -- and their equivalents found on other social platforms -- aren't succeeding merely because they are lowering friction; they are also tapping into longstanding (and possibly innate) human preferences. Shopping has always been a communal activity. Brick and mortar shopping -- once the defining feature of suburban malls everywhere -- is migrating to social platforms.

<strong>The future of social commerce</strong>

The evolution to social commerce and the digital storefront is still in its early stages. This means that forward-thinking brands stand to earn a competitive edge by staking out their ground early.

It's very possible that in the near future, social media platforms will become more than a conduit to e-commerce. Consumers hate friction, so businesses are locked in a never-ending battle to eliminate it. While pressing a catalog image at the bottom of a social ad and being sent to a retailer's website may not seem like much trouble, imagine a future where you see an item in Snapchat or Instagram and buy it immediately, with a single touch.

Social media has already swallowed the news reporting and publishing businesses. Most of us don't visit these websites anymore; we are redirected to them via our social apps. Social media platforms are now the process of doing the same thing to the world of entertainment, with their focus on original video content.

Despite Amazon's hegemony, it's not a stretch to imagine a similar fate for e-commerce.

<strong>Finding the right e-commerce development company</strong>

At BIGEYE, we're excited by the opportunities presented by social commerce, and we're experts at helping brands gain more online retail traction. The right <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ecommerce-development-company/"">e-commerce development company</a> can help you derive maximum benefit from Shoppable Snap ads and other tools.

How influence became the currency of marketing & why it matters,"If you're a longstanding fan of TV's ""The Bachelor"" or ""The Bachelorette,"" you've probably lost count of the hundreds of contestants who have contended for roses and eternal love (or at least a plausible television wedding) over the course of the last decade.

Yet just because eliminated contestants may drop out of sight, doesn't mean they drop out of the public's mind. Many have devoted followings on social media that endure long after their time in front of the camera ends.

And marketers are well aware of this.

Ex-reality TV stars pitching products on Instagram and other platforms have become a cottage industry. Whether hawking teeth whitening strips or ""flat tummy tea,"" contestants from ""The Bachelor"" and other shows are cashing in. While they may have failed to find a perfect TV love match, they've found the next best thing:

A new career as a well-compensated influencer.

<strong>How influencer marketing became inescapable</strong>

At this point, cultural influencers have become both omnipresent and meme-worthy -- just look at the new ""Influencer"" Halloween costume from Urban Outfitters, for example. Yet influencer marketing isn't the sole province of reality stars and social media personalities. While it's true that many of these influencers have built sizeable and devoted followings, you can also think about <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/"">influencer marketing</a> in a much broader way.

One such example is Nike's recent campaign built around NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Though the on-field protests Kaepernick led and inspired were controversial, they were also deeply inspiring and influential to a large segment of consumers.

By creating a campaign that highlighted, in a central fashion, Kaepernick's protest for social equality, the influencer marketing strategy agency tapped into the disposition in a very real and moving way. Of course, this isn't the kind of influencer marketing that's fit for everyone -- it's a polarizing issue with the potential to divide audiences. But it also allowed Nike to become a serious player in an ongoing cultural conversation -- not an easy thing to do for any brand.

Another example is McDonald's. As AdWeek notes, the burger chain has been drawing positive reviews for the minimalism incorporated in its new global design aesthetic. McDonald's creative agencies seem to be on the same wavelength.

Remember the artist Banksy's self-shredding painting -- the one that self-destructed after being purchased at auction? Worldwide media was fascinated by the story (much as they are with anything Banksy-related), so McDonald's creative team came up with two minimalistic takes on the art world phenomenon.

It was a clever way for McDonald's to trade on Banksy's influence, and the larger trends that are driving art, media, and design.

<strong>Do I need an influencer marketing strategy agency?</strong>

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/"">Influencer marketing</a> is inescapable for a good reason -- it's highly effective. Brands can target highly motivated niche audiences by partnering with social media stars, or become part of larger societal trends by incorporating those themes into their campaigns.

A content marketing agency: The solution to understanding Gen Z,"Well, it's time for a new challenge: Generation Z. They're kind of like Millennials, but just a little bit extra.

In just three years, the global population of Generation Z will outnumber Millennials, reaching a population of about 2.5 billion. In the United States, members of Generation Z now comprise 20% of the population and rising.

To be successful, marketers need to understand the shift that's occurring. In order to do that, they need greater insight into the makeup, preferences, behaviors, and motivations of Generation Z, which is why partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> might be beneficial for you.

<strong>Personal appearance, immediacy, and the ""Instagram Effect""</strong>

Generation Z is the first cohort to have never really known a world without the smartphone or social media. They've grown up in public, documenting their lives online. In this sense, they are part of a radical experiment, having no experience of the slower and more private analog world that existed before smartphones and social platforms.

A report compiled by Fung Global Retail &amp; Technology draws <u><a href=""https://www.fbicgroup.com/sites/default/files/Gen Z Report 2016 by Fung Global Retail Tech August 29, 2016.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">some interesting conclusions</a> </u>about Generation Z, including the following:
<ul>
 	<li>They attach great importance to personal appearance, having spent their lives being judged (and judging others) on social media.</li>
 	<li>They spend more on leisure and lifestyle purchases (restaurants, travel, etc.) due to the competitive pressures of social media (also known as the ""Instagram Effect).</li>
 	<li>They are the most demanding and least patient generation in history, due to on-demand services such as Netflix, Postmates and Uber.</li>
</ul>
These three characteristics are, of course, of particular interest to content marketers. Members of Generation Z are extremely interested in products tied to appearance. They are hungry for experiences; their consumer spending habits are often tailored to the need to show social media audiences that they have fun, interesting, and meaningful lives.

They also have a craving for, and expectation of, immediacy. Because this generation has grown up in an environment where products and services appear at the push of a button, they've been conditioned to expect a fast response.

<strong>How a smart content marketing agency connects with Gen Z</strong>

Generation Z members spend around <a href=""https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/content-marketing/the-art-and-science-of-content-marketing-for-gen-z/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nine hours each day</a> on their devices, scrolling through various feeds, posting content and socializing. In order to increase engagement, marketers should do the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Rely on video and images rather than text.</li>
 	<li>Create visually-striking content that stands out, with a clear call to action.</li>
 	<li>Use an attention-grabbing approach that cuts through the clutter. Generation Z has grown up immersed in advertising, so it takes something novel to seize their attention.</li>
 	<li>Understand the sensibility. Younger people document their lives on social media, if you want to understand what they think is funny or interesting, all you need to do is look.</li>
 	<li>Don't patronize. There's nothing worse than a brand attempting to connect with young people by clumsily appropriating their humor or lexicon. When something like this lands, it can be <a href=""https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-twitter-delete-your-account-retweet-1201912895/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">very effective</a> -- but it can also <a href=""https://www.ranker.com/list/brands-trying-too-hard-and-failing/jacob-shelton"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">backfire spectacularly</a> if not executed well.</li>

A creative brand consulting guide: Let consumers skip your ads,"Admit it -- you're not a fan of ad breaks.

Almost everyone wishes they could skip the ads that play before a YouTube video, or in between Spotify songs. More importantly for advertisers, <a href=""https://www.iab.com/insights/ad-blocking-blocks-ads-win-back/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">about 25%</a> of people act on the impulse by using ad blocking software.

You might think that an innate dislike of advertising is driving this behavior; however, that's not the case. People aren't opposed to advertising -- they just don't like the kind of advertising they are seeing: Irrelevant, uninspiring, and impersonal. In fact, <a href=""https://www.iab.com/insights/ad-blocking-blocks-ads-win-back/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">two-thirds of people</a> who use ad blocking software say that they are open to discontinuing the practice if the experience of watching ads improves.

So, how do brands and creative <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand consulting advertisers</a> break through this resistance?

Spotify thinks they have the answer.

<strong>A truce in the ad blocking wars</strong>

In the summer of 2018, Spotify began testing a new ad protocol in Australia called Active Media. The idea was simple: Give users more control over the ad viewing process. Active Media allowed Spotify users to skip all of the ads they wished, unlike the regular free Spotify service which requires limited ad viewing. It also allowed advertisers to avoid having to pay for any of their ads that were skipped over by users.

Sounds like a win for users and brands, right? But how does Spotify benefit?

If you're thinking ""by getting access to valuable subscriber data,"" give yourself a well-earned pat on the back. By allowing users to choose only the ads they are truly interested in, the streaming music service learns more about its user's preferences.

This is critical for Spotify, as it seeks to evolve into a full-service platform rather than a publisher. By gathering deeper and more precise user data, Spotify learns what users like and what they want -- information they can later share with brands. Armed with this data, brands can create relevant, personalized, and targeted campaigns.

That kind of engagement moves the needle for advertisers, something that ultimately could lead to Spotify <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/10/spotify-free-skip-ads-active-media/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">earning more money</a> for each spot it runs. In that sense, Active Media is a bet on quality over quantity, and the notion that people will respond favorably to ads (and will avoid finding technological means to avoid them) if they are given more control over what they see.

In all, it is a win/win for everyone -- except the developers of ad blocking software, of course.

How brands can turn cross-channel advertising to their advantage,"You probably knew that Facebook and Google are behemoths of the digital world. Yet you might not appreciate just how far their respective reaches extend.

Recent research shows that Facebook and Google account for <a href=""https://econsultancy.com/what-is-cross-channel-advertising-and-why-do-you-need-it/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more than a quarter</a> of the time spent online by users in the United Kingdom. For every three-and-a-half minutes, U.K. users spend online, one of those minutes is dedicated to a Facebook or Google property.

And that's something that has extraordinary implications for advertisers.

<strong>Making the ""digital advertising duopoly"" work for you</strong>

Due in part to their online omnipresence, Facebook and Google own a staggering 60% of the global <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital advertising</a> market. By creating a cross-channel advertising campaign that exploits the power and reach of these two digital titans, brands can benefit from this market dominance.

A cross-channel approach makes sense because it closely tracks how audiences behave and how they consume content. Most of us are constantly toggling back and forth between apps and devices, something that can seriously limit the effectiveness of an ad run across a single channel.

With a cross-channel approach, advertisers can port user data between channels and use it to build more targeted and effective campaigns. One example of this is the <a href=""https://econsultancy.com/what-is-cross-channel-advertising-and-why-do-you-need-it/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Spanish hotel firm Melia</a>, which uses a cross-channel campaign focusing on real-time search intent.

By using cross-channel tools, Melia was able to identify the specific destinations users searched for on Google. Then, the company had the capability to automatically create custom Facebook audiences derived from those searched keywords.

The results were deeply impressive: A return on investment 30 times higher than seen with their traditional Facebook campaigns, and a conversion rate increase that was 22 times higher.

As this example illustrates, Melia was able to use Facebook and Google together in a way that heightened the impact of both. By using cross-channel advertising in this fashion, brands not only gain greater visibility into the history and preferences of their audience but an enhanced ability to measure and track performance.

Brands can also use tools to ensure ad continuity across channels. This means ads won't repeat, and more relevant ads can be delivered, as needed depending on where a user is in the funnel. The more touch points created, the more the effect of the ad is amplified.

We've also written before about how cross-channel is <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/ott-you-know-me-jump-into-cross-channel-advertising/"">integral to Over-the-Top</a> (or streaming) media. When audiences are hopping from device to device, or channel to channel, it's essential to have a unified <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand message</a>. Roughly <a href=""https://mashable.com/2012/03/05/future-digital-marketing-trends/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">three-out-of-four</a> consumers say they prefer an integrated approach, while Google has published data showing that most people display better ad recall when shown cross-channel advertising.

Ultimately, by offering a unified message, creating more touch points and leveraging the power of multiple platforms, brands can maximize the reach of their campaigns.

Want to win over consumers? Try humble brand packaging design,"Have you ever received a large package from Amazon -- only to discover a much smaller package inside? It's kind of like the retail version of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Russian nesting doll.</a>

There's a word for this phenomenon: Overboxing. In a world where the global environment is under rising stress, overboxing has emerged as a real issue for businesses and online retailers. Customers, especially younger ones, are demanding sustainable solutions -- which means brand <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaging design</a> has become more important than ever.

<strong>The perils of ""overboxing""</strong>

Online retail giants such as Amazon and Alibaba ship billions of products each year and these numbers are expected to grow significantly in the coming decades. That translates into an enormous amount of cardboard, styrofoam and bubble wrap.

Given the hefty amount of debris that comes with modern packaging – and isn't typically recycled – that's a serious burden on the environment. Amazon is attempting to limit the damage by asking its vendors to follow new standards under its ""Frustration-Free Packaging"" program. The ultimate goal is to limit overboxing by having vendors send their products to Amazon in boxes that are ready to ship.

This is an approach that aligns with changing public sentiment. The numbers are stark: <a href=""http://sustainabilitynext.in/news/gen-z-more-demanding-more-from-companies/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">94% of Generation Z</a> members say businesses should work to solve environmental and social issues, while 89% say such efforts are a factor in their buying decisions. No other demographic group places this of an emphasis on corporate sustainability.

<strong>Sidestepping ""wrap rage"" and delivering agile design  </strong>

In the early days of e-commerce, businesses took the same retail products meant for the shelves, placed them in a box, and shipped them to online retailers or customers. Today, that kind of practice often leads to extraordinary waste -- and <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/08/27/chilling-wrap-rage-hasbro-and-amazon-pack-toys-with-less-stuff/67adehbeQYQjNnUGRK339H/story.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""wrap rage""</a>-induced social media call outs.

In order to stay on the right side of sustainability, today's businesses are moving away from a product design aesthetic that made shelf appeal paramount. Instead, these businesses are merging this objective with the practicalities of sustainable packaging.

Hasbro's <a href=""https://www.bna.com/amazon-retailers-redo-n73014483019/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""Baby Alive"" doll</a> is one such example: By following Amazon's stricter guidelines, the company was able to reduce the total amount of packaging used by 50%. Other popular products that have been redesigned for sustainable shipping include Play-Doh and Mr. Potato Head.

While choosing this path may require additional research and development money, smart brands can recoup part of this through the use of clever marketing. Sustainability is a major priority for many buyers and can serve as a critical differentiator for brands seeking a competitive edge.

Our <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/"">creative team</a> has an eye for design that jumps off the shelf (or in this case box) -- and a desire to help companies grow sustainably.

Why measurement is the key to unlocking digital advertising dollars,"If a tree falls in the woods, but no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

You've probably heard that hoary old chestnut once or twice before. So let's update it to the age of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agencies</a>.

If you create a brilliant marketing campaign, but its effects can't be accurately measured, is it really succeeding?

<strong>New tools and sharper measurements</strong>

Recently, at this year's Advertising Week, YouTube <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/youtube-is-launching-new-ad-formats-and-ways-to-measure-them/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">announced an expansion</a> to its TrueView in-stream ad format, one that allows viewers to take actions while watching ads. These actions include purchasing movie tickets, booking vacations and downloading apps. Companies such as 20th Century Fox, Maybelline, and Vodafone have tested the service, and have reported intriguing results. Vodafone, for example, reported a 3.5% click-through rate and significant improvements in ad recall.

The idea behind the upgrade is simple: While a video ad for a new film might intrigue a viewer, it can just as easily be forgotten a few minutes later, meaning action is never taken. YouTube's new system allows viewers to immediately open an interface that shows theater and ticket availability, allowing the viewer to book a ticket while the experience is occurring.

YouTube also announced a new addition to its Google Measurement Partners program. Now, in addition to Oracle Data Cloud and Nielsen Data Solutions, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agencies</a> and marketers can measure their data through third-party <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/"">research firm</a> IRI.

IRI is supporting Google's <a href=""https://marketingland.com/iri-to-help-google-measure-offline-sales-impact-of-youtube-ads-249397"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">new brand lift metrics</a>, which show advertisers the following data:
<ul>
 	<li>Positive response rate</li>
 	<li>Number of lifted users</li>
 	<li>Cost per lifted user</li>
 	<li>Headroom lift</li>
 	<li>Absolute brand lift</li>
 	<li>Relative brand lift</li>
 	<li>Control positive response rate</li>
</ul>
IRI is supplying Google with e-commerce and in-store sales data to show the precise impact YouTube ads are having on sales -- precious insight for any marketer.

Pinterest has also announced new measurement options associated with Oracle Data Cloud's Moat Measurement (for viewability) and NinthDecimal (for foot traffic). Pinterest reports achieving 90% viewability for Pinterest's in-app ads, which is much higher than Moat's industry benchmark of 57%.

NinthDecimal, meanwhile, analyzed billions of ad impressions across numerous industries. The conclusion: 93% of Pinterest campaigns delivered an increase in foot traffic.

<a href=""https://business.pinterest.com/en/blog/new-measurement-solutions-to-help-brands-measure-pinterests-impact"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">These studies illustrate</a> the critical importance of having refined measurement tools that can offer brands quantifiable evidence of campaign impact. In an era where accurate ROI calculations are a competitive imperative, access to such tools has become essential for almost any brand operating in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital advertising</a> space.

We work at the intersection of creativity and technology, here at BIGEYE. We believe that effective campaigns require brilliant ideas and the advanced technological tools needed to implement them.

Why eight major retailers need a holiday season miracle,"For consumers, Amazon is the gift that keeps on giving.

For legacy retailers, however, the online retail giant is poised to be a holiday Grinch of epic proportions.

With the brick and mortar retail industry in serious trouble<u>,</u> the holiday season has become absolutely critical to the prospects of businesses such as Sears and J.C. Penney. Profits earned during November and December can help keep legacy retailers afloat in a sea of shrinking margins.

This year, the need to prosper over the holidays is even more acute. According to USA Today, <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/01/2018-holiday-shopping-retail-debt-results-season/1816910002/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">17 major retailers</a> have defaulted on their debt in the last two years, including names such as David's Bridal, GNC and Payless. Making things even more dire, these brands are struggling while consumer confidence has reached an 18-year high and the federal unemployment rate sits <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/national-employment-monthly-update.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">at just 3.7%</a>.

USA Today recently identified the <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/01/2018-holiday-shopping-retail-debt-results-season/1816910002/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eight major retailers</a> most in need of a holiday miracle in 2018. Let's take a closer look at how they got there -- and how your own brand can learn from their mistakes.

<strong>Sears</strong>

The Problem: Outdated business model, lackluster branding, and deep financial trouble. Though it has strong brand recognition and a rich history, Sears is a case study example in failing to adapt to, and evolve with, the market. The stores are entangled in retail generalist mode, attempting to be everything to everyone. Walking through a Sears is like walking with the Ghost of Retail Past -- a sad, wistful experience.

The Prescription: In an age of retail specialization, Sears needs to find a new niche -- while updating its in-store experience and advertising for the 21st century.

The Prognosis: Likely terminal, but we may have another holiday season or two together.

<strong>Bed Bath and Beyond</strong>

The Problem: Overextended (too many locations), underfunded (too little digital revenue) and undistinguished (no cachet). Bed Bath and Beyond's sales have plunged since 2014, with the company's stock hitting<a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/news/companies/bed-bath-beyond-stock-earnings/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> an 18-year low</a> in September.

The Prescription: An online transformation. Bed Bath and Beyond's digital offerings (both e-commerce and marketing) have been utterly insufficient compared to those of Target and other competitors.

The Prognosis: Critical but stable. Though Bed Bath and Beyond's sales figures are in a shocking state, the company doesn't carry much debt, which could buy it some time.

<strong>J.C. Penney</strong>

The Problem: Like Sears, J.C. Penney has struggled to evolve from its original (and deeply dated) model. Unlike Sears, J.C. Penney has thrown everything at the wall in order to change this. They've introduced appliances, toys, ""permanent sale"" pricing gimmicks and in-store Sephora locations. However, nothing has truly moved the needle.

The Prescription: A vastly better retail experience. If you're not going to give consumers specialization or IKEA-level prices, you'd better offer them a magical in store experience. Can you say <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2018/08/15/3-reasons-why-cmos-should-embrace-experiential-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">experiential marketing</a>?

The Prognosis: Grave. J.C. Penney's financials aren't as precarious as Sears, but the company ultimately needs to do more than eke out enough holiday sales to survive. Long-term this is a company that needs to be re-imagined from the bottom up.

<strong>Neiman Marcus</strong>

The Problem: A debt tsunami and digital despair. Neiman Marcus still has strong luxury branding, but its yet another legacy retailer creaking into a brave new world.

The Prescription: Burdened with debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, Neiman Marcus needs a buyer or an investor to go with a revamped e-commerce strategy and updated brand messaging. It's a classic brand -- but not a particularly relevant one.

The Prognosis: Critical and unstable. The financials are a mess, and a new buyer may be the only way to keep this enterprise afloat.

<strong>Your favorite mall chain: Claire's, Charlotte Russe and J Crew</strong>

The Problem: Mall foot traffic is down and mall vacancies are way up, as more people prefer the ease of e-commerce. Claire's, Charlotte Russe and J Crew are all struggling with debt and declining in-store revenue.

The Prescription: Mobile smartphones apps, <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/5-ways-location-based-marketing-will-evolve-2017-175204/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">location-based marketing</a>, and revamped in-store experiences.

The Prognosis: Critical -- and conjoined. The fate of these three stores is tied to the viability of the shopping malls that house them. And malls -- much like the stores inside them -- are under siege and in need of innovative new thinking.

How the Google Maps updates could hurt your business,"If you've noticed that Google Maps and your website are no longer working harmoniously, you're not alone. Recent Google Maps updates have caused significant technical problems for business owners.

To help get your broken Google Maps functioning again -- or to help ensure that you don't have to worry about dealing with this issue -- let's take a closer look at what's causing the trouble and the steps you can take to fix it.

<strong>Why Google Maps is causing performance issues</strong>

With one billion monthly users and 99% worldwide coverage, the Google Maps platform is a powerful, far-reaching business tool. It allows customers to locate businesses, allows businesses to offer consumers customized, immersive experiences and provides rich location data for more than 150 million locations. By using Google Maps businesses can create 3D games with global data, improve efficiency by tracking the movement of assets in real time and develop useful applications.

Yet for some users, these benefits may be temporarily inaccessible following some recent changes implemented by Google -- changes that could disrupt service and performance.

On June 11, 2018, users of the Google Maps Platform were required to enable credit card billing and have a valid API key for all projects. All 18 APIs were also streamlined into three categories: Maps, Routes, and Places.

This means that keyless usage, as of June 11, was <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">no longer supported</a> by the Google Maps Platform. If a keyless call is made to either the Maps Javascript API or the Street View API, a low-resolution map is returned bearing the inscription ""for development purposes only.""  Keyless calls to many other APIs will simply return an error message.

<strong>Why is this a problem?</strong>

Businesses that were not aware or apprised of these changes are experiencing service interruptions to their projects. For example, if a business hires a freelance web developer to create new online properties that incorporate Google Maps, they may be unaware of the impact of these changes.

In fact, it may just appear as if their Google Maps have suddenly broken, for no obvious reason. Given the importance of the Google Maps Platform to many businesses, service interruptions are a serious risk.

<strong>Steps to take</strong>

Businesses should ensure that new accounts are created very early in the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website design </a>process, as this has a significant impact on development. It has now become impossible to develop map functionality on an existing site that includes a map without an associated API key.

It should be noted that <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/billing/understanding-cost-of-use"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">pricing will fluctuate</a> depending on the type and functionality of the map, the number of waypoints, usage etc.

Businesses that lack the technical resources -- or simply don't have the time -- to ensure the smooth running and regular maintenance of Google Maps should consider reaching out to a qualified <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">third party developer</a> for more assistance.

<strong>How BIGEYE can help:</strong>

At BIGEYE, we believe that a modern agency needs to combine world-class creative with advanced technical skills. If you're having difficulty maintaining Google Maps -- or have any technical or design challenge related to your digital properties -- please don't hesitate to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">reach out to us for help.</a>

"Design trends, friends, other creative odds & ends","2018 was a year of unique design approaches that will continue into 2019. Bold colors, duotone photo filtering, playful typography layouts, deconstructed and asymmetrical layouts, and rich metallic and holographic foiling techniques are just a few of the visuals that dominated design these last 365 days.

The philosophy of building a complete <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">brand system</a> (not just a singular standing logo) was also something that bubbled over into the mainstream this year, especially for larger brands. These are brand identity systems that are structured for ease of use and at extremely small sizes while also being allowed to flex, expand, and contract with execution. This approach will continue on as the most effective way to create and implement a modern-day brand.

2018 also revealed the growing trend of larger brands beginning to bite the bullet and commission their own typefaces. The point being to avoid hefty licensing fees, and having their own custom-designed typeface is the ideal long-term solution.

Photography also took a hard right turn this year. Compositions that appear more amateur and “Insta-documented” were a noteworthy visual, especially for brands wanting to connect with younger audiences.

Lastly, we have a hunch that the stripped-down-personality of the super sans-serif wordmark-only type treatment trend in logo design may slowly start to fade away as we get further into 2019 and 2020. But of course, that’s yet to be seen!

No matter the trends that come and go, two important things will always remain—using tried-and-true design principles of balance, rhythm, and harmony, paired with telling a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story</a> that connects with its intended audience.

Why new Alexa programming tricks are a treat for users,"In a very short period of time, Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant have gone from tech novelty to an honorary member of the family for millions of people. With Alexa programming growing ever more refined and powerful, it seems as if there's no end to what smart speakers can do around the house.

And now thanks to some recent upgrades, you can add ""trick or treating management"" and ""voting assistance"" to the list.

<strong>Why Alexa's new tricks are a real treat</strong>
Alexa's ability to respond to what's happening in the world around us is one of its most intriguing qualities. A great recent example is Alexa's capability for <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/amazon-alexa-smart-doorbell-apis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">making event-driven announcements via smart cameras and doorbells.</a> These announcements can be customized to fit almost any event, including holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions.

During Halloween, if a smart doorbell sees kids approaching, Alexa can be programmed to turn on house lights and music and either welcome trick or treaters to a home -- or inform them that the candy supply has been depleted and the home is closed until next year.

Amazon released two new APIs (Doorbell Event Source and Motion Sensor) that allow developers to quickly and easily add this functionality. Once added, Alexa users can enable the announcement feature in Alexa's Smart Home device settings section. This new integrated feature comes off the heels of Amazon's recent purchase of Ring, the smart doorbell company.

Some Alexa devices (including the Echo Spot and Show, also allow for the enabling of two-way communication via smart camera between residents and those knocking on their doors.

<strong>How Alexa is creating more informed voters</strong>
Halloween isn't the only example of Amazon working to make Alexa's skills more timely and relevant. Prior to Election Day in the United States on Nov. 6, Amazon equipped Alexa with a <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/amazon-election-data-midterms/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">much wider base of election data</a>. This information included polling station locations, real-time election results, and detailed information about various local ballot measures -- exactly the kind of information that voters need, but often have a hard time finding in one central location.

All of the election information delivered by Alexa is strenuously non-partisan; Amazon worked with three partners to help furnish the necessary data: RealClearPolitics for polling, the Associated Press for election results and Ballotpedia for ballot measure language and explanations. Amazon said it chose these sources because they were the most ""credible and neutral"" that the company could find.

Amazon assembled its own ""war room"" of data scientists, engineers, and other personnel to ensure the election information provided by Alexa was as accurate as possible. Given the recent <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/05/facebook-foreign-election-meddling-ahead-midterms/1899284002/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">electoral disinformation controversies</a> involving Facebook and other social platforms, it's not surprising that Amazon chose to prioritize neutrality and accuracy.

For Alexa users, the ability to access high-quality election data that's updated in real time is a significant plus -- and one more example of how Alexa programming is improving the lives of users in small but tangible ways.

Medical marketing agency: A partner that provides a healthy impact,"Even with the help of a talented <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">medical marketing agency</a>, health insurance companies are never going to be sexy, or set consumer pulses racing. Most Millennials report that they would rather go 24 hours without using any social media than sign a stack of healthcare insurance forms. Yet this industry does have a major ace in the hole in terms of brand perception and audience engagement: healthcare is a social good, and Millennials are <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/cause-related-marketing-millennial-mindset/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>pro-social consumers </u></a>who expect brands to do their part.

By developing a compelling medical marketing campaign, brands in the health field can get the message out about the differences they are making in people's lives -- something that's good for both society and business.

<strong>How Cigna positioned itself as a healthcare champion</strong>

Speaking at the recent ANA Masters of Marketing Conference in Orlando, Florida, Cigna's Global CMO, Susan Bacus, <a href=""https://www.mmm-online.com/home/channel/corporate/cignas-role-as-a-champion-for-customers-in-health/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>said that 81% </u></a>of people believe global brands have the power to make the world better, according to recent research. Additionally, from its own internal research, Cigna discovered that roughly 70% of healthcare costs are linked to lifestyle choices.

Given these numbers, the company took action in a few key areas to transform how the brand operates and is publicly perceived. The first step was a stronger attempt to improve health outcomes through prevention. To help accomplish this, Cigna devised a clever ""TV Doctors"" marketing campaign featuring some of the most famous fictional physicians from the small screen, all of whom encouraged people to get regular checkups.

The results were impressive -- and not merely from a patient care perspective. In the aftermath of the campaign, preventative visits jumped 18%, customer growth spiked 6% and revenue climbed 9%.

In addition to the campaign, Cigna also placed a new emphasis on discussion of larger societal issues affecting wellness while also taking a more empathetic approach to its health guidance and advocacy efforts.

Bacus said Cigna's campaign and subsequent changes proved that caring for people and good business are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a more empathetic approach is actually better for business; it not only drives superior health outcomes,  but it improves how a brand is perceived by a public that's increasingly cause conscious.

<strong>Using the power of medical marketing to make the world a better place</strong>

Cigna's ""TV Doctors"" campaign is a good example of how a medical marketing agency can serve the business interests of an enterprise, while also serving a larger societal good. Brands can choose to pursue cause-related marketing by partnering with a non-profit or follow Cigna's example of reorienting its marketing messaging and business processes to improve real-world outcomes.

This kind of altruistic, cause-related marketing offers a variety of benefits: It attracts new customers, it deepens the loyalty of the customer base you already possess and it enhances a company's image. It also helps brands stay aligned with audience expectations. This is especially true in the medical field, where access to affordable insurance coverage is not universal, and the ""business"" side of medicine is often a sensitive subject.

<strong>What a top medical marketing agency can do for you</strong>

Being a top <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Florida advertising agency</a>, we help healthcare firms create the kind of compelling marketing campaigns that engage audiences and win new customers. If you'd like to see what a dynamic new medical marketing approach could do for you, please <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">reach out to us today</a>.",,12/14/2018 10:13,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Medical-marketing-agency-A-partner-that-provides-a-healthy-impact.jpg,medical-marketing-agency-a-partner-that-provides-a-healthy-impact,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
How a brand development company can help you with the impossible,"If a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">brand development company</a> can make voting fashionable, then anything is possible.

It might seem like a stretch, but some of the best minds in branding are on that very mission. Though doing your civic duty is critically important for democracy, the U.S. has historically underperformed in terms of voter turnout, regularly <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ranking near the bottom</a> of most indexes.

And that's somewhat understandable -- standing in line at a polling station is nobody's idea of a glamorous way to spend a morning, and once civic apathy sets in, it can be hard to break.

Fortunately, Bumble -- and some of the other leading brands in Silicon Valley -- are helping increase turnout by giving the voting process some social cachet.

<strong>Making voting a social plus</strong>

<strong> </strong>Until recently, voting was a solitary activity. You lined up, entered a booth, cast your ballot and trudged off to work. Today, however, you're likely to see people uploading photos and videos of themselves voting to social media and even live streaming the event. Voting has become a public performance -- and that may be the key to making it more popular.

Bumble, a dating platform that is one of the most forward-thinking brands in the tech space, understands this and has taken steps to capitalize on it. Bumble teamed up with a public awareness campaign called ""I Am a Voter"" (admittedly not the best name we've ever heard) to increase voter turnout.

To accomplish this, Bumble created a new profile badge that allows users to identify as a voter. It's the digital version of those omnipresent ""I Voted"" stickers. The idea is simple: People know that voting is a social good, and that is perceived as a voter is a plus in the eyes of other people. By tapping into this sentiment, Bumble is helping to brand the voting process as something that's desirable -- something that affirms your status as a serious, civic-minded person.

In addition to the new badge, Bumble also added new in-app functionality to assist users with voter registration.

Bumble -- a feminist dating app whose team is largely comprised of women -- has a long history of using its platform and brand <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bumble-donated-to-planned-parenthood_us_58091612e4b0cdea3d8662d7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in the service of larger social goods,</a> making the voting campaign a natural extension of both its ethos and brand.

The dating platform <a href=""https://www.record-bee.com/2018/11/02/look-what-tech-companies-are-doing-to-get-out-the-vote/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">wasn't the only Silicon Valley company </a>working to promote voting. Uber offered discounted rides to polling places on Nov. 6 (Election Day) and integrated directions to users' local polling places, while Lyft offered free and discounted trips to the polls.

Bumble competitor Tinder worked with voting registration project ""Rock the Vote"" to maximize turnout by offering swipe-based in-app registrations. Even Dropbox and other firms gave their employees free time off to do their civic duty at the polls.

Is all of this having an appreciable effect? The early returns are overwhelmingly positive. Young adult voting (the demographic most likely to be influenced by these tech-based approaches) saw <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/youth-turnout-midterm-2018/575092/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a staggering 188% increase </a>in turnout during the Nov. 6 midterm election. Whether it's the result of outreach efforts from companies like Bumble -- or Taylor Swift urging her 112 million Instagram followers to vote -- it's clear that tech and social platforms have not only helped increase civic turnout but have also helped rebrand the process of voting for a new age.

<strong>Finding the right brand development company</strong>

Technology -- and clever branding -- have helped turn voting from a solitary and somewhat dreary civic duty to a communal experience meant to be celebrated.

Why digital marketing agencies encourage the use of Pinterest,"While Facebook and Google have long been the twin titans for any <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a>, savvy marketers know that size and reach aren't everything. In terms of selling products and services, a small -- yet inspired and motivated -- audience is often much more valuable than an audience that's large but indifferent.

When it comes to social platforms, Pinterest (and Instagram) dominate that visually inspired and motivated market. While people might peruse Facebook for funny cat videos, news articles and political rants, they visit Pinterest to <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/forget-facebook-why-marketers-are-embracing-pinterest-and-instagram/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">find visual inspiration</a>.

Pinterest (and smart brands) understand how valuable this kind of inspiration is in a marketing and advertising context. That's one reason why the platform is rolling out new tools to help brands monetize visual inspiration.

<strong>How promoted carousel helps create more meaningful ad experiences</strong>

<a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/forget-facebook-why-marketers-are-embracing-pinterest-and-instagram/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Pinterest's latest move</a> is the introduction of a new self-service ad format called Promoted Carousel. This new feature allows digital marketing agencies and Pinterest advertisers to use, for the first time, up to five images in their ads.

The process works like this: Brands can use Carousel cards to feature five distinct images, titles, descriptions or landing pages, something that allows businesses to take a varied and creative approach. All while giving users more reasons (and avenues) to engage with their ads. Carousels then appear in feeds just like any other pin, and users can swipe through, or tap, the cards inside the feed.

Carousel ads can be purchased three ways: By using Pinterest's ad manager suite, by the use of an I/O or via programmatic media trading through Pinterest's API marketing partners.

These ads are designed to help consumers gain a more detailed understanding of the products and services being offered. Major firms, including REI, Toyota, Cheerios, Cover Girl, and Everlane, have used Pinterest Carousel in beta.

According to Pinterest's internal numbers, the results have been encouraging: Cheerios saw an eleven point increase in ad awareness and a nearly nine-point lift in message association. Meanwhile, Everland reportedly tripled the clickthrough rate it achieved with standard Pinterest ads.

<strong>Why </strong><strong>Pinterest</strong><strong> carousel provides brands with a competitive edge</strong>

Pinterest has long maintained an important edge over its rivals in the social/digital advertising space: Its users are ""closer to the point of purchase"" than users on other major social platforms. People use Pinterest to find items to buy and things to do, to plan their purchases and activities and to share them with others.

That's not the only reason why Pinterest Carousels are positioned to carve out a significant niche in the shoppable ad category, however. <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/pinterest-debuts-promoted-carousel-ad-formats/?utm_content=position_4&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=AWK_Programmatic&amp;utm_campaign=Programmatic_Newsletter_2018110214&amp;s_id=5b7599c2f730431ca3429212"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Observers also note</a> that the technical specifications of the new ads will allow brands to tell more meaningful stories. Pinterest Carousels - and the new Max Width Video format -- will allow marketers to ""use the full real estate"" of users' phones by delivering more content across a larger space.

Additionally, formats such as these are a natural fit for some of Pinterest's most popular content categories, including travel, food, fashion, and beauty -- all subjects that lend themselves to visual representation. By telling a multi-image story, brands can create more immersive ad experiences, while using the natural advantages of the Pinterest platform to their benefit.

Politics affect sales according to influencer marketing agencies,"Brands and influencers have long exercised great caution when dealing with anything falling into the categories of sex, politics, and religion. Yet times are quickly changing. This election season saw public figures such as Oprah and Taylor Swift engage in unprecedented political activity. Brands, too, were eager to join the electoral fray, often under the direction of an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">influencer marketing strategy agency</a>.

So what does this mean for the future of brands, politicians and these newly emboldened influencers with dedicated followings?

Quite a bit, it seems.

<strong>Why ""politics"" is no longer forbidden for influencers</strong>

The high-profile political activity displayed by A-list celebrities like Oprah and Taylor Swift didn't occur in a vacuum. Influencers as a whole have never been as deeply involved in electoral politics.

Fohr, an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">influencer marketing agency</a>, ran a campaign called ""Influence the Election"" during the midterms. The campaign asked influencers to connect their Instagram accounts to the company's website in order to receive story templates to help identify highly engaged political content and encourage tagging and sharing. In a <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/this-company-is-using-the-power-of-influencers-to-get-people-to-vote/?utm_content=position_5&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=AWK_Programmatic&amp;utm_campaign=Programmatic_Newsletter_2018110516&amp;s_id=5b7599c2f730431ca3429212"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent interview </a>in AdWeek, James Nord, CEO of Fohr, claimed the campaign reached nearly 100 million people.

Nord said he was inspired to start the campaign after he noticed that influencers were largely ignoring news about the Trump Administration's ongoing attempts to institute a travel ban. Nord said this lack of engagement prompted him to wonder about the power influencers wield and how they choose (or choose not) to use it. Many influencers, Nord believed, failed to post about political issues because they felt it was simply out of their niche.

That, however, may soon be changing.

<strong>How influencers are creating a new kind of politics</strong>

The ""Influence the Election"" campaign was designed to be a digital election yard sign of sorts. Just a decade or two ago, candidates fought bitterly to secure the endorsement of newspapers. These endorsements were exceptionally valuable because of the gatekeeper role that newspapers filled. Many people had their political views shaped by the work of a relatively small number of reporters and editors.

Today, that gatekeeper role has been greatly diminished. The Internet allowed thousands of websites to blossom, democratizing coverage of news and politics. Even more importantly, social media gifted every person a megaphone. Now, instead of relying on one newspaper to deliver an endorsement, politicians could receive endorsements from individual influencers with highly devoted and motivated followings.

Many influencers are staying fairly neutral in terms of content, encouraging followers to vote and support widely popular causes. Yet as the space matures, we could soon see influencers working on behalf of candidates much in the way they work for brands. Candidates can identify influencers who have followings that match their demographic priorities -- and who have political views in alignment with their own -- and ask the influencers to use their platform to promote their campaigns.

While this is a tricky road to tread (especially given <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39830727"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the past problems</a> Facebook and other platforms have faced with more nefarious targeted influence campaigns), it's not difficult to envision a future where politics and commerce are largely indistinguishable in the way that they interact with influencer marketing.

Orlando marketing agency learns from the Masters of Marketing,"If you own or work for an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Orlando marketing agency</a> -- or you just love advertising -- it's the most wonderful time of the year.

And we're <em>not </em>talking about the holiday season.

The 2018 Association of National Advertisers (ANA) Masters of Marketing conference recently wrapped up in Orlando -- and there was plenty to discuss, both at the event and afterward.

Let's take a minute to review some of the highlights of the event, and some of the most important takeaways for advertising and marketing professionals.

<strong>The buzz around in-house agencies is mostly noise</strong>

You may have heard recent chatter about the reported trend of brands developing their own in-house agency capabilities -- a conversation that dominated much of the discussion at this year's Masters of Marketing Conference.

At least one observer, however, believes there is less to this than meets the eye. Speaking in an interview with Ad Age, Avi Dan, an advertising consultant with decades of experience on the brand side, said he hadn't seen <a href=""https://adage.com/article/special-report-ana-annual-meeting/marketing-consultant-house-agency-buzz-noise/315436/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""a single brand-building campaign""</a> that originated from an in-house agency.

Dan added that while some work may be best handled internally, the notion that in-house agencies would become a significant player in the near-term is groundless. Other presenters at the conference pointed out that many brands simply <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/agencies/why-media-agencies-think-clients-will-come-crawling-back-after-in-housing-services/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">lack the expertise and resources</a> (particularly in areas such as programmatic buying and data analytics) to effectively handle operations in-house.

<strong>The latest on the FBI and media buying</strong>

Another eyebrow-raising topic at this year's conference was the FBI's probe into the media buying practices of certain ad agencies. The topic was the <a href=""https://adage.com/article/agency-brief/agency-latest-media-buying-fbi-probe/315569/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">subject of a talk</a> given by the ANA's top attorney, Doug Wood, during the conference.

The probe is exploring allegations that a handful of agencies engaged in deceptive and non-transparent practices, including collecting cash rebates from media vendors and not passing them along to clients. The ANA released a white paper on the topic in November to better explain the issue to the advertising community.

Wood said that the result of the probe (which could potentially spark reforms toward greater transparency in the industry) should be known in six to twelve months.

<strong>The word of the week was ""purpose""</strong>

One buzzword made repeated appearances during conference presentations: Purpose. Marketing execs from FedEx, eBay and Ancestry repeatedly hammered home the importance of ""brand purpose"" during presentations.

Vineet Mehra, Ancestry's Global CMO, defined brand purpose as the ability to ""enable journeys of personal discovery that collectively inspire a world of greater understanding and belonging.""

Meanwhile, Rajesh Subramaniam, FedEx's Chief Marketing and Communication Officer, concurred, saying that marketers are only just beginning to ""unlock the power of purpose."" Suzy Deering, EBay's North American CMO, called brand purpose ""incredibly important,"" also adding that it's ""is not going away.""

As Ad Age, <a href=""https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/ana-daily-blog-day-1/315378/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cleverly pointed out</a>, it seems that <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">Orlando marketing agencies</a> can already safely predict one of the key themes for next year's conference.

Mobile app marketing agency: A game changer for your brand,"If your business isn't devoting resources to in-app advertising, you should take note of the following number: <a href=""https://mobilemarketingmagazine.com/77-per-cent-of-brands-investing-in-in-app-inventory"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>77% of brands</u></a> have asked their media or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">mobile app marketing agency</a> to make an investment in this category.

And, frankly, we believe that number should be closer to 100%.

If you're not willing to explore making a similar -- or even greater -- investment, your business could find itself playing catch-up to competitors and missing out on a booming market.

<strong>Why in-app advertising works</strong>

We live on our phones.

At this point, that notion has crept into the realm of cliche, but that doesn't make it any less true. People use mobile devices for just about everything and spend <u><a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/mobile-time-spent-2018"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">nearly four hours per day</a> </u>interacting with them. By 2019, mobile devices will surpass televisions in terms of daily use.

Apps, in turn, account for more than 90% of all time spent on smartphones.

You don't have to be a marketing savant to draw the conclusion. People spend enormous time within mobile apps, which means that in-app inventory should be a key focus for media buyers and brands.

A recent study by Fyber, a firm specializing in app monetization, paints an interesting picture of the in-app inventory landscape. According to Fyber's global research, in-app inventory will account for 43% of overall digital ad budgets within the next five years -- a nearly 30% increase from today's numbers.

Currently, 68% of brands use in-app ads to foster awareness, while 52% of brands are using in-app ads to generate new sales. One of the most popular environments for in-app ads is gaming; 60% of brands favor advertising within games for their scale and reach, while 59% cited high user engagement. Roughly 78% of brands have used in-app ads within games, while 91% of agencies and 87% of brands say they plan to do so in the future.

<strong>The benefits of in-app advertising</strong>

The explosive popularity of apps allows brands to reap a variety of benefits from advertising within this format. These advantages include:
<ul>
 	<li>More sophisticated and accurate targeting</li>
 	<li>Deeper user engagement</li>
 	<li>Higher return on investment</li>
</ul>
According to Fyber's research, brands and mobile app marketing agencies report that certain types of ads tend to perform better than others. The ads that have performed best for study participants include playable ads, video ads, and opt-in ads.

Firms located in the U.S. and the U.K. have found the most success with in-app ads with nearly one-third of U.S. firms reporting that their in-app ad spend is at least 50% of their digital marketing budget. Meanwhile, 82% of U.S. firms say that they have asked their agencies to focus on in-app ads specifically, rather than the broader category of mobile advertising.

These numbers reflect the growing interest in the in-app advertising space. People are using apps more often, they are spending more time inside these apps, and in-app advertising is -- by a considerable margin -- <u><a href=""https://econsultancy.com/why-marketers-should-consider-in-app-advertising-stats/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the fastest-growing form</a> </u>of digital advertising. Apps are used throughout the day, often during periods when users cannot access other media. This means that in-app ads can reach audiences in a way that other marketing channels cannot.

One study showed that in-app ads are <u><a href=""https://mobilemarketingmagazine.com/app-revenue-13x-higher-mobile-web-ads"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">13 times more valuable</a> </u>than mobile ads. While they generate similar numbers of impressions, in-app ads more than doubled the CTR of mobile ads while generating 13.5 times the revenue.

How brand strategy firms respond to people un-friending Facebook,"Whether you're a top <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy firm</a> -- or merely a casual social media user -- you've probably noticed that young people are un-friending Facebook in droves in favor of Instagram and other platforms.

The statistics are enough to keep Mark Zuckerberg up at night: According to Pew Research, <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/teens-abandoning-facebook-still-flocking-to-instagram.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">71% of Americans</a> aged 13 to 17 reported using Facebook in 2015. By 2018, that number had dropped to just 51%. Meanwhile, Instagram's numbers have reversed among teens, rising to 72% today from 52% in 2015. Snapchat and Youtube have also seen sizable increases.

So what do these platforms possess that Facebook lacks? And how should brands, like yours, respond?

Let's take a closer look.

<strong>Why Facebook has become ""platform non grata"" among younger users</strong>

One of the reasons why Facebook has fallen out of favor with younger users is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/19/facebook-users-sharing-less-personal-data-zuckerberg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""context collapse""</a>. This concept describes how the various identities that people possess (the way they choose to present themselves to others) overlap and sometimes conflict across networks.

In the case of Facebook, it works like this: Someone creates an account, and friends a few hundred people. Some are close friends offline, but most are merely acquaintances or friends of friends -- people we rarely interact with in person. Over time, Facebook users may grow uncomfortable with the idea of sharing personal stories or information with people they rarely see or don't know that well. Yet they may still wish to share with people in their network who are closer to them.

Another example: A Facebook user who has friended work colleagues may feel uncomfortable with sharing photos and video of a recent night out celebrating. The context -- and the intended audiences -- are in conflict.

Facebook has made attempts to remedy this issue (allowing users to designate audiences for posts and create smaller groups that friends can be sorted into). Yet these are hardly the kind of simple, frictionless solutions that appeal to younger users.

This desire to avoid sharing with people on the periphery of one's social circle is even more pronounced among younger social media users. Platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat <a href=""http://www.blackenterprise.com/young-people-facebook-marketing-strategy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">are better suited</a> to this tendency by their very design, which focuses on more narrowly tailored sharing and smaller groups.

Additionally, Facebook's newsfeed -- once an incredible innovation in its own right -- has become a source of frustration for many users, stuffed with old or irrelevant content. The innovative features recently developed by Facebook's rivals (like stories, stickers, lenses etc.) are much more in tune with how younger people wish to consume content.

<strong>How brands should respond</strong>

The numbers don't lie: There is a mass movement away from Facebook by young people, and brand strategy firms need to respond accordingly. If a campaign is needed to target a younger demographic, Instagram, not Facebook, should be the primary platform under consideration. All content (and all business accounts) <a href=""https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-optimize-instagram-profile-for-business/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">should, therefore, be optimized</a> for Instagram.

Instagram stories, when used properly, is a powerful tool for reaching younger audiences. The feature has been enormously popular since its 2017 rollout (enough to make Facebook commission its own version) and has deepened engagement, especially among young users. Research shows that Instagram users under 25 are now <a href=""https://instagram-press.com/blog/2017/08/02/celebrating-one-year-of-instagram-stories/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">spending 32 minutes per day on the platform</a>.

By adding polls, links and other features to Instagram stories – and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy firms</a> designing all ads and content in a format that's optimized for younger viewers -- brands can ensure they stay on the right side of recent trends.

Why Alexa skill programming allows for safe library use,"She can tell you a story, call you an Uber and give you a delicious dinner recipe -- and do it all in a British accent if you like. Thanks to <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Alexa skill programming</a>, there seems to be no limit to what our favorite digital assistant can do.

Here's another one: Alexa can accomplish everything we just listed above while using her ""inside voice."" That's right, Alexa now whispers -- and it's just as weird and fun as you'd expect.

<strong>Why you never have to worry about Alexa waking the baby again</strong>

Amazon's new ""whisper mode"" for Alexa, which was announced in September, officially went live in October. Now, if you whisper your question or command, Alexa will reply in kind with her own whispered response.

While this seems like a smart new feature for parents of young children, or people in busy office settings, the development of whisper mode was prompted largely by another factor: The desire to make Alexa more lifelike. By giving her the ability to whisper back at you, Amazon's engineers have made her more human sounding and natural, able to respond to conversational cues more intuitively.

The result is <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-alexa-whisper-mode-how-to-turn-on-2018-10"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">something to behold</a>. Alexa sounds breathy and more than a bit eerie - but also <em>very </em>natural and human.

Whisper mode is not turned on by default, so users will have to ask Alexa to enable whisper mode (simply saying ""Alexa, turn on whisper mode"" will do the trick). Or, you may also choose to turn on whisper mode by toggling through the app.

<strong>Alexa: Smarter, faster, better</strong>

As <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/18/17995092/amazon-alexa-whisper-mode-guard-context-aware""><em><u>The Verge </u></em>mentions</a>, whisper mode is yet one more step in making Alexa more contextually aware by expanding her AI-enhanced capabilities. Alexa uses machine learning to discern sound patterns that are evident in whispered speech, which then triggers a whispered response.

This same machine-learning network is used by Alexa to recognize smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Alexa can also use it to identify the sound of glass being broken, which allows Alexa to serve a home security role. By becoming more contextually aware, Alexa is able to recognize more than just human speech -- and therefore play a much larger role in the home.

Amazon's <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/alexa-will-soon-gain-a-memory-converse-more-naturally-and-automatically-launch-skills/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Alexa Brain Initiative</a> is working to refine the voice assistant's ""memory,"" so to speak, allowing her to track and recall information across multiple dialogue sessions, something that will make it easier for users to engage with the vast number of third-party Alexa programming skills currently available. Users can also ask Alexa to remember specific information, and then furnish it later.

Amazon has also made progress in the effort to make skill launching easier and more user-friendly. Instead of following rigid conversational cues, the goal is to have Alexa activate skills based on natural human language -- ultimately becoming so refined that she can recognize a request even if it's delivered with a stutter, a digression, a long pause -- or a whisper.

<strong>Is your business taking advantage of Alexa Skill Programming?</strong>

Smart speakers are poised to have a transformational impact on the way we live and do business, much in the same way that mobile devices did a decade before. At BIGEYE, our voice experts specialize in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">Alexa skill programming</a> -- and we'd love to show you how your company can benefit from the right set of skills. <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact our Alexa experts today</a> to take the next step with your brand's voice and capabilities.",,12/24/2018 15:44,1,https://bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Why-Alexa-skill-programming-allows-for-safe-library-use.jpg,why-alexa-skill-programming-allows-for-safe-library-use,publish,,Bottom,0,open,0
Top Florida advertising agency protecting children from predators,"Mobile technology sometimes gets a bad rap from parents, who are (perhaps rightfully) concerned about over-exposure to screen time. Yet thanks to a new app developed by a Florida state law enforcement agency, mobile technology is helping to protect children from predators. It's one more example of how smart app development -- often facilitated by a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/"">top Florida advertising agency</a> -- can help organizations improve their processes.

<strong>Using technology to keep kids safe</strong>

The app, known as FDLE Mobile, was created by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. It helps track sex offenders and delivers alerts straight to the phones of parents. FDLE Mobile was released just prior to Halloween -- a holiday where parents tend to be especially vigilant about who's living in the neighborhood.

By using the app, parents can identify where sex offenders live in the area -- and subsequently avoid those homes, especially when trick or treating.

It's a clever technological solution to a very real problem. While sex offender registries are publicly available, the information isn't always easily accessible. Parents may have to scan poorly organized and non-user friendly websites to find where registered offenders live.

By creating <a href=""https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/fdle-rolls-out-app-ahead-of-halloween-to-track-sex-predators-and-more"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the new app</a>, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (the state's top agency), has made this information instantly accessible on a mobile device, allowing parents to make more informed decisions about the places their children are allowed to go.

<strong>A well-rounded technological solution</strong>

The new app, which is <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fdlemobileapplication/id1434743798"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">available for download</a> for both iOS and Android, also possesses a variety of other useful features. Along with searching for sex offenders and identifying their locations on a map, users can search for missing people and unsolved cases, review local laws and explore Florida crime statistics.

The app also allows citizens to report suspicious activity directly from the app to local law enforcement and keep up with the latest videos and website links from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

Florida's law enforcement community isn't alone in their efforts; the development of mobile apps to assist with law enforcement priorities is a growing trend. Other examples include the RAIDS app, which allows the public to identify areas where recent crimes have occurred and send alerts about criminal (or suspicious) activities in those areas.

Another app, US Cop, is designed to help officers (in street roles) with their day-to-day job duties. Features include CPR tutorials, pill identifiers, case law primers, training articles, and investigation formulas. The Red Cross also maintains a first aid-based app that helps police officers and members of the public effectively respond to emergencies, potentially saving lives in the process.

Police are also using mobile applications to help them <a href=""https://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2016/01/3-best-mobile-apps-law-enforcement/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">resolve language barriers</a> between officers and the (often non-English speaking) communities they serve.

Much like every other industry, law enforcement is becoming much more tech and data-driven. By harnessing the power of deep data and mobile, top Florida advertising agencies can help members of the community better protect themselves -- while also helping conduct operations with greater insight and efficiency.

Five Marketing Tactics to Drive More Profit for Your Business,"If you're the owner of a small to mid-sized business in Florida, you've probably thought deeply about how to make your enterprise more profitable. In most cases, this can be accomplished one of three ways: You can improve or expand your product or service; you can develop more efficient business operations and processes or you can execute on these five marketing tactics to drive more profit for your business.

Fortunately for most business owners, the third option is often not only the most effective, but also the most feasible. By understanding a few essential concepts -- or by working with a <a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/"" data-cke-saved-href=""http://bigeyeagency.com"">top Florida marketing agency</a> -- you can put together a comprehensive marketing plan that wins new customers and generates more revenue.

To help you get started with this process, let's take a closer look at five foundational marketing concepts that, when taken together, can form the basis of an effective overall marketing strategy.

<strong>Media Buying</strong>

Put simply, media buying is the act of paying for exposure for a product or service. This exposure can be through a TV commercial, a newspaper or magazine ad, or any other medium that connects businesses with their intended audiences. This process is often handled by an outside <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/"">media buying agency</a> that coordinates the process of buying media. This can be done by buying billboards, paying for TV programming slots or taking out space in print publications.

The act of media buying is typically part of a larger, overall <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">media strategy</a> that outlines how businesses -- or the <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">media planning agency</a> they work with - can optimize the process of getting marketing messages in front of audiences. These strategies generally involve a detailed mapping of the media environment and a review of existing media content and distribution channels.

By engaging in the processes of media buying and media strategy -- either internally or by contracting services with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">digital media buying agency</a> specializing in media buying services -- companies can target audiences with marketing content more effectively and at lower cost. This means that any business seeking to generate more revenue from its existing operations should strongly consider optimizing its overall media strategy -- and a top Florida media buying agency can help you formulate the proper plan.

<strong>Digital Marketing</strong>

Digital marketing can be simply described as the marketing of products and services through digital technologies, including mobile phones, the Internet, display ads and other digital sources. Businesses typically handle their <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/why-digital-marketing-agencies-encourage-the-use-of-pinterest/"">digital marketing</a> efforts one of two ways: By devising and executing a digital strategy internally, or by contracting with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a> -- sometimes also called a ""digital media buying agency,"" ""Internet marketing agency"" or ""<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing consultant</a>.""

Digital marketers use a variety of tactics to market products and services to consumers. These tactics include Search Engine Optimization (<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">SEO</a>) services, content marketing, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/"">influencer marketing</a>, social media marketing, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email marketing</a> and search engine marketing. A top digital strategy agency also often specializes in high-level marketing techniques such as attribution modeling or data analysis.

Given the massive growth in digital content over the last two decades -- with television networks and publishers migrating online and smartphones becoming a preferred method of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/a_content_marketing_agency_the_solution_to_understanding_gen_z/"">content</a> consumption  -- businesses that make digital marketing a priority have been well-positioned for success.  <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">Digital targeting and retargeting</a> growth has tracked closely with this proliferation of digital content, with trillions of digital ads now being served each year.

Companies that make a priority of working with an expert <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing consultant</a>, or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">top Florida digital marketing agency,</a> can help generate profits by leveraging the wide reach, low cost model offered by digital ads.

<strong>Branding</strong>

Branding is a critical discipline within the marketing and advertising fields, as it differentiates the products and services offered by a business from its competition's products and services. Businesses seeking to create a powerful brand story will often seek out the services of a top <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">branding agency</a>, one with the skill and experience to  to execute a complete brand strategy from the ground up.

This may include aspects such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand naming</a>, designing a product or service (or its packaging), brand <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo design</a>, taglines, symbols and other graphics and generating compelling brand messages.

Once branding is developed, businesses must focus on <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a>. This refers to the process of positioning a brand within a certain market niche. A technology company, for example, may wish to position its product as the most sophisticated in its category and also the most refined, going after a target demographic that is both tech savvy and style-conscious.

By partnering with top creative agencies to assist with product branding or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand style guide</a>, companies can help carve out a competitive edge in their marketplace, while also cultivating a loyal customer base. The right brand consultant or branding agency can help develop <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand messaging</a> that connects with audiences on a personal level.

Consider, for example, the case of Apple. While the company certainly makes great products, that's not really the secret to its success. Apple's devices don't always have the most advanced features; yet they do have a very distinct, fully-realized aesthetic and a deeply compelling <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story</a>. Apple's most dedicated customers buy their products because they perceive themselves to be an ""Apple person"" -- one in line with the company's very refined branding. They personally identify with the brand they are patronizing.

That kind of loyalty is priceless to businesses -- and an excellent illustration of the power of branding.

<strong>Video Production</strong>

There's no doubt about it: If you're the owner of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">video production company</a> Florida is one of the most attractive markets in which to operate. After all, sunny weather makes for fewer missed photo and video shoots.

That's not the primary reason Florida has become synonymous with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">video production</a>, however. Florida is home to some of the most talented creative agencies in North America, some of whom specialize in the kind of compelling digital video production that moves the needle in a marketing campaign.

Why is digital video production such a difference maker? Part of it has to do with changing attitudes. Today, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/thinking/how-a-video-production-company-can-help-with-your-linkedin-ads/"">digital video content</a> has exploded in popularity, thanks to ubiquitous smartphones, technological advances such as 4K HD and the desires of younger people, who often prefer video content consumed over apps and social media platforms rather than the printed word. These developments have made video --whether seen in a campaign over commercial TV or social media -- an integral part of modern marketing campaigns.

This means that for those interested in <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">corporate video production Florida</a> is also an excellent place to find help with such a project. Video production companies in Florida can assist with both <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/motion-graphics-design-company/"">motion graphics design</a> and commercial <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production services</a>, helping local businesses create campaigns that attract eyeballs and win new customers.

<strong>Website Maintenance</strong>

Businesses should consider their website to be the public face of the company. If your website is clean, professional, updated and well-designed, it gives visitors confidence. Conversely, if your website is visually cluttered, out of date, broken, confusing, or just offers a generally poor user experience, potential and existing customers can be immediately turned off. This is one reason why hiring a website maintenance company can have such a positive effect for small to mid-sized businesses.

By opting to partner with a website management firm (or website updates company), businesses can outsource tasks that they may not have the expertise (or time) to complete. This may include paying attention to critical Google Maps updates, monitoring Wordpress maintenance and supplying a fast and ready solution anytime a panicked ""fix website"" order comes down from a business struggling to keep its site live and fully functional.

In addition to these critical tasks,  a website maintenance company typically offers a range of broader services to its clients. These may include a comprehensive website maintenance plan, a Wordpress maintenance plan and other <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/website-maintenance-services/"">website maintenance services</a>.

Perhaps the primary benefit of working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/website-maintenance-services/"">website maintenance company</a> is the knowledge that a company's public face rests in qualified and experienced hands. Businesses don't have to worry about missing critical updates, and losing functionality for customers -- something that can quickly lead to outraged complaints and permanent loss of business. Additionally, the right website maintenance company can help ensure that all digital properties stay operational and user-friendly, something that will ultimately drive more revenue and profits to the businesses that own them.

<strong>The Takeaway</strong>

Marketing plays an absolutely critical role in the success or failure of a business. It helps differentiate products and services, and it also creates a story that resonates with audiences and helps them identify with the businesses they patronize. When done well, marketing is an incredibly powerful tool that can create significant competitive advantages.

By focusing on areas such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">branding</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">video production</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/website-maintenance-services/"">website maintenance services</a>, businesses can drive more profits, reach new audiences and ensure that products and services are delivered in a consistent and reliable fashion.

A comprehensive guide to marketing services,"If you’re a small to mid-sized business owner, you almost certainly don’t have enough time in the day to get everything finished to your satisfaction.

Additionally, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/usability-testing-company/"">usability testing company</a> can help a company determine how an intended audience interfaces with a product or service, while Florida research companies specializing in market data can assist with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">consumer profile services and qualitative research services</a>. This gives their clients a broader picture of who their audience is, and how those audiences are responding to products, services and marketing campaigns.

Creative work is the heart of effective marketing and branding. Whether it’s <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/print-advertising-agency/"">print advertising</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/sales-material-design-company/"">sales materials design</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/collateral-design-business-printing-services/"">collateral design</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/annual-report-services/"">annual report design</a>, creative work is the conduit through which audiences and brands connect.

Most small to mid-sized businesses don’t have the budget or expertise to deploy an in-house creative team. That’s not an insurmountable hurdle, however; by contracting with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">copywriting company</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">outdoor marketing agency</a>, <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/tradeshow-display-company/"">tradeshow display company</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">packaging design agency</a>, brands can realize their creative vision and better connect with their customers.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/""><strong>Digital marketing</strong></a>

We’ve reached a point where the terms “marketing” and “<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing</a>” are almost interchangeable. Most of us live, work, communicate and play online -- which means that businesses need to do their utmost to connect with people in the digital realm.

This is accomplished by the following techniques such as <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/email-marketing-agency/"">email</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing</a> and various forms of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">pay-per-click marketing services</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">display advertising services</a>. By working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital marketing consultant</a>, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">content marketing agency</a> or an email marketing agency, brands can help ensure that they reap the rewards of a digital approach.

A new and critically important trend is voice technology. Given the staggering adoption numbers for smart speakers and digital assistants, forward-thinking brands should also consider pursuing <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">voice development services</a> from an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/alexa-developer-services/"">Alexa app company</a> or a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">top Florida digital marketing company</a>.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/""><strong>Strategy</strong></a>

Great marketing campaigns all begin with a smart, overarching strategy. This strategy should encompass everything a business does in terms of marketing creation and distribution, including various content types and channels.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-data-analysis/"">Marketing data analysis</a> conducted by a marketing strategy agency can play a key role in this process, as it provides a sound foundation on which to build campaigns and test assumptions. Businesses may also wish to focus on more niche areas by employing an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience segmentation consultant</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social media strategy company</a>, both of which can play an integral role in helping brands identify and engage with ideal audiences for their products and services.

Today, a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">comprehensive marketing strategy</a> must cover a wide variety of channels, reflecting the nature of how audiences live, work and consume content today. This means that working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">multi-channel marketing company</a> that specializes in this kind of approach is often a smart idea.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/""><strong>Media buying</strong></a>

When it comes to good marketing, distribution is just as important as creation. You can have the most compelling campaign in the world, but if nobody sees it, what good does it do?

That’s where <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/"">media buying</a> enters the equation. The right <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">media strategy services</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">media planning agency</a> can help ensure that your marketing content gains maximum exposure through every relevant channel, including print and TV.

Digital, too, is an important piece of the media puzzle. A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">digital media buying agency</a> that specializes in this channel can help ensure your campaign gains traction, while an <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/attribution-modeling-company/"">attribution modeling company</a> can provide you with measurable data that confirms whether or not particular marketing or advertising approach is effective.

In today’s changing world, it’s also important to ensure that your media campaigns reflect the viewpoints of all consumers, which means that it makes sense to work with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/multicultural-marketing-agency/"">multicultural marketing agency</a> that has the perspective to connect with all audiences.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/""><strong>Web development services</strong></a>

Maintaining fully-functional websites with smooth and intuitive <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">user experiences</a> should be a key priority for just about any business. Websites serve as the public face of a business and also often play an important role in generating revenue. If a business can't be trusted to offer the public a professional and reliable website, prospective customers may wonder about the quality of the products and services they will receive.

However, not every business is equipped to maintain a reliable, user-friendly digital presence. In such cases, it makes sense to partner with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">web design company</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">website development company</a> that can handle every aspect of creating and maintaining digital properties. Additionally, a good <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/content-management-systems-company/"">content management company</a> can help ensure that businesses place high in organic search rankings by following the principles of search engine optimization and content marketing.

Continuity is also critically important, as downtime can result in lost revenue and angry customers. An Orlando web development firm offering <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/website-maintenance-services/"">website maintenance services</a> can help local businesses ensure that their digital properties suffer from minimal technical interruptions.

By partnering with <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/"">top Florida web design consultants</a>, local businesses can ensure that their online presence serves the needs of their customers, while also attracting new business thanks to the compelling design and reliable functionality.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/""><strong>Branding</strong></a>

In order to be successful in a highly competitive landscape, businesses need a way to differentiate their products and services -- and that's where the art of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">branding</a> comes into the picture. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">Branding agency services</a> and <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-naming-service/"">brand naming services</a> help companies establish compelling brands by developing product names, packaging, and other key design elements. For example, a business may choose to hire a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/logo-design-company/"">logo design company</a> as part of its overall branding strategy.

A <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">brand story agency</a> can also help businesses create a compelling brand narrative, one that communicates the values and vision of an enterprise to its audience. <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">Brand messaging services</a> can also help a company convey their value proposition to consumers while communicating a message that inspires, intrigues and motivates potential customers.

Branding, when done properly, should inform how a business communicates on every level. Hiring a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">brand strategy firm</a>, or devising a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-style-guide-service/"">brand style guide</a>, can help brands ensure that their public-facing content maintains a consistent brand voice. Meanwhile, the practice of <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">brand positioning</a> defines precisely how the products and services a business sells differ from that of its competitors.

When looking at creating a new branding approach from the ground up, companies will often seek out the help of a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">brand strategy firm</a>. These are full-service agencies that can help with all aspects of a new <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">branding program</a>, or the rebrand of an existing company, product or service.

<a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/""><strong>Video production and marketing</strong></a>

Roughly a decade ago, businesses were in scramble mode to accommodate society's shift to mobile devices. Within a very short period of time, the smartphone and tablet transformed with the way people live, work and consume content. Today, we're experiencing another major shift, this time centered around video.

Because people (particularly younger demographics) prefer consuming video over other formats, the creation of marketing and promotional videos has become an essential marketing service.  By partnering with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-production-services/"">video production company</a> or <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">video editing company</a>, brands can reach new audiences and deliver the type of compelling content that leads to successful marketing campaigns.

Social media platforms, of course, are a powerful distribution channel for video content. By working with a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/web-video-production-agency/"">social media video company</a>, brands can leverage the expertise of these agencies and greatly increase the reach and engagement of their video-focused social campaigns.

For businesses seeking <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">top video </a>production, Florida is an ideal place to be located. Along with sunny weather and beautiful scenery, Florida is home to some of the world's best creative agencies. This means that brands in the market for a <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/corporate-video-production-company/"">corporate video production company</a> to lead their latest campaign are perfectly situated.

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/""><strong>Social marketing</strong></a>

Social media marketing services are one of the fastest-growing agency marketing offerings. That's for good reason: The reach and power of social media are greater than ever, and <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media advertising services</a> are subsequently in high demand.

Yet while the right <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">social strategy</a> can pay enormous dividends, many businesses simply lack the experience and expertise to execute a high-level social media marketing campaign. In such cases, these businesses should strongly consider working with a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social content agency</a> or <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media management company.</a>

These agencies have the specialist skill to create high-performance social marketing campaigns that gain serious engagement among users. Social media can be a powerful (and cost-effective) amplifier for a brand. Yet without the right strategy, even the best content will be ignored.

To ensure that all company social media services are on point, businesses without an internal team of experts should strongly consider working with an agency, one well-versed in search optimization and audience-building techniques.

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/""><strong>Influencer marketing</strong></a>

One only has to glance at Instagram today to see the power of influencer marketing in action. Social media influencers and brands have formed a symbiotic and mutually profitable relationship, as popular platform users use their followings and personal brands to highlight sponsored brand products.

Yet cracking the code of this emerging world of influencers isn't always easy for established brands, many of which lack social media expertise. An influencer marketing agency (sometimes called an ""<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-management-agency/"">influencer management agency</a>"" can help fill this shortcoming by pairing brands with the right influencers.

Most brands find influencer marketing to be highly effective, as it connects their products and services with people who have dedicated and highly motivated online followings. This is one reason why working with an <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/influencer-marketing-strategy-agency/"">influencer marketing strategy agency</a> has become so popular in recent years.

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/""><strong>Public relations</strong></a>

The work of a public relations agency is primarily centered on two objectives: Ensuring positive press and public perception, and getting a brand's message out into the public sphere. A company may choose to do this by scheduling interviews, sending out press releases and other such services.

Because public relations is vitally important work, it often makes sense for businesses to use an outside agency with specialist skills. A media relations agency can help ensure harmonious interaction with the press, while a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/crisis-communication-company/"">crisis communications company</a> can step into the breach and manage public perceptions during a period of turbulence.

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/media-press-release-services/"">Press release services</a> and <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/media-training-services/"">media training services</a> are two other functions often filled by a public relations agency. Businesses seeking help with such tasks can reach out to a Florida PR agency, or an Orlando PR company, for assistance.

"Digital marketing agency deep dive on Instagram's recent ""bug""","You don't have to work for a digital marketing agency to remember the chaos that ensued after Snapchat redesigned its platform.

Prominent <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/"">influencers </a>reacted in horror, slamming Snapchat's new look and feel. Daily users began<u> <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661878/snapchat-earnings-q2-2018-results-redesign"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">departing in droves</a></u>. Advertisers grew nervous and began to deploy resources elsewhere.

And as for Snapchat's leadership? They played it cool, rolling out the usual party line that accompanies most digital redesigns: Sure, people hate it at first, but they always come around.

Except in Snapchat's case, they didn't -- forcing the company to<a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-is-bringing-stories-back-to-discover-2018-4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u> walk back some of the changes</u></a> as its user numbers plummeted along with its stock price. Overall, it was a terrible experience for Snapchat, but at least it offered a stellar case study in ""what not to do when implementing a redesign"" for other platforms.

Or did it?

<strong>What was behind Instagram's transformational design change?</strong>

During the last week of 2018, Instagram rolled out a surprise update to its app -- one that sparked an outcry highly reminiscent of last year's Snapchat redesign debacle.

This surprise update eliminated the ability for users to scroll vertically and instead introduced a horizontal scrolling system. As you might expect, this rather significant -- and entirely out of the blue -- change created all sorts of<a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/instagram-apologizes-after-redesign-sparks-outrage-it-was-a-bug-spokeswoman-says-2018-12-27"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u> anger and astonishment</u></a> online.

In the immediate wake of the change, the word ""Instagram"" began trending on Twitter, as celebrities and typical users alike vented outrage about both the new design and the unexpected way it was implemented.

It seemed, at least for a moment, that l'affaire Snapchat was back for an encore presentation. And, for those working at a digital marketing agency, it was a turn of events that brought one question to mind: Could one of Snapchat's primary competitors actually make the same devastating mistake less than a year later?

<strong>A bug, not a feature</strong>

In the wake of the outcry over Instagram's sudden change, the company blamed ""a bug"" for changing how the feeds of ""some users"" appeared. Instagram relayed that the problem was fixed and apologized for the issue.

Some observers, however, expressed mild skepticism as to whether this update was truly a bug.<u> <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/instagram-temporarily-rolls-out-new-functionality-angers-the-internet/?utm_content=position_2&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=AWK_Programmatic&amp;utm_campaign=Programmatic_Newsletter_2018122814&amp;s_id=5b7599c2f730431ca3429212"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Adweek pointed out</a></u> that Instagram's buggy update could actually introduce interesting <a href=""https://bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">new possibilities for digital advertisers</a>. Instead of simply scrolling past ads, users would be required to tap to get out of displayed ads, similar to the way Instagram Stories is set up. This could introduce the possibility for at least one new metric: How fast users tap out of specific ads.

Business Insider<u><a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-horizontal-feed-snafu-2018-12"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> noted much the same thing</a>,</u> pointing out that horizontal scrolling is more consistent with Stories -- a format that Mark Zuckerberg claims will overtake the Facebook News Feed as the primary way people share and consume content. This is expected to occur by mid-2019, according to Facebook projections.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Was Instagram's update a bug or a premature rollout? In our estimation, probably a bit of both. Given the advantages of horizontal scrolling, it's likely Instagram meant to test the update to a small subset of users, then accidentally made the release much wider than intended. Either way, in the wake of last year's Snapchat-Gate, Instagram needs to proceed very cautiously when considering such changes.

"The secret to brand placement? Location, location, location.","What does selling real estate and using media to sell your brand have in common? It's all about one thing: <a href=""https://www.thebalance.com/what-location-means-in-real-estate-1798766"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Location, location, location</a>. You don't have to work for a top media buying agency to understand that context is critical when it comes to brand placement.

If you need evidence of the importance of location, look no further than this year's Super Bowl -- where one global beverage giant is preparing to go all in to maximize the effects of its advertising campaign.

<strong>Anheuser Busch's massive Super Bowl bet</strong>

The Super Bowl is the most significant betting event of the year. It's estimated that Americans <a href=""https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/02/04/super-bowl-gambling-money-bet-total"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">bet nearly $5 billion</a> on the game annually. Global beer giant Anheuser-Busch is making its own massive wager on this year's Super Bowl, planning one of the largest ever media buys.

The brewer announced it has purchased five-and-one-half minutes' worth of airtime, during which it will show commercials for five of its brands and seven of its products. That's an impressive outlay, given that the average cost of a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl has risen to <a href=""https://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/super-bowl-ad-spending-history-charts-52-years/311881/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">roughly $5 million</a>. The Super Bowl, in fact, is so important to brands and the advertising industry that it represents 2.5% of all network broadcast advertising for an entire year.

Anheuser-Busch's Super Bowl advertising expenditure will be roughly 30% higher in 2019 than in previous years. The company believes the increase is justified due to the extraordinary nature of the event; the Super Bowl regularly draws <a href=""https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/super-bowl-lii-ratings-1202687239/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">more than 100 million viewers </a>in the United States.

<strong>The Super Bowl...of ads</strong>

For advertisers, however, huge viewership is only part of the equation. The Super Bowl, in recent years, has become more than a football championship; it's also a showcase for the ad industry's very best work. Super Bowl commercials have become near-compulsory viewing for many Americans, as brands save their most compelling and engaging creative work for Super Bowl Sunday. The high quality of Super Bowl ads has made the event perhaps the only occasion where people are actually eager to watch advertising.

Anheuser-Busch knows this. The company's U.S. CMO, Marcel Marcondes, <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/anheuser-buschs-biggest-super-bowl-push-ever-5-brands-7-products-and-more-than-5-minutes-of-airtime/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">recently told Adweek </a>that  “attention is the new currency and (the) Super Bowl is such a unique moment in culture when people are paying attention, watching TV and more than that, they are willing and looking forward to watching TV commercials. So for that reason, we decided to bet big.""

In other words, <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">it's all about location strategy</a>: Reaching the right people, in the right place, at the right time, <em>and </em>when they are in the right frame of mind -- all accomplished through utilizing a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">smart media buying agency.</a>

<strong>Why location is critical for brands</strong>

Anheuser-Busch is wisely betting that the benefits of Super Bowl advertising -- and the singular nature of the event -- will justify their $50 million ad spend. Yet few businesses, of course, have the resources to buy even the shortest Super Bowl ad.

That doesn't matter, however, as virtually any enterprise can reap the advantages of brand placement in the proper media locations. Even if you scale down from the Super Bowl to advertising on a local network affiliate, the principle remains the same: Find the location, time, and context where viewers or listeners overlap with your customers or audience.

If you don't have media buying experience, that might seem like a tall order. However, a high-quality media buying agency can partner with businesses to <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">precisely identify and plan the best possible media </a>locations for ad spending.

What struggling brands have in common with week-old croissants,"Human relationships are fairly predictable. First, we fall in love. We can't wait to tell everyone, both online and off. After a few years, the magic fades and we start exploring our options. Of course, we're not talking about relationships between <em>people </em>here, but rather how people treat their relationships with their favorite <em>brands</em>. Consumers fall in and out of love quickly -- and companies often need a good brand positioning agency to keep that relationship viable.

Why are brand relationships with consumers often so fleeting? It's simple: Even the world's most compelling branding can turn staler than last week's croissant if it isn't updated and refreshed regularly.

<strong>Why a famous refreshments brand opted for its own refresh</strong>

While it might seem foolish to tinker with an icon, even the most beloved brands benefit from an occasional facelift. In fact, longstanding brands often benefit the most from an update. <a href=""https://www.pepsi.com/en-us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">One example is Pepsi</a>, which recently re-positioned its brand around a new tagline: ""For the Love of It.""

Pepsi has rolled out its new tagline in more than 100 markets worldwide. Roberto Rios, Pepsi's SVP for Global  Marketing, said the new jingle is a call to arms or sorts, serving as a ""rally cry"" for people to ""go all in for the things they love.""

The new tagline is also accompanied by a new product jingle performed by singers and dancers from 14 different nations. Pepsi also chose to add new can designs to its brand refresh, with new typography and slogans, including ""Max Taste No Regrets"" and ""With Mischief and Love.""

These changes represented the first significant refresh in seven years for the beverage giant, whose last major brand update was built around the ""Live for Now"" tagline -- the same tagline that featured prominently in Kylie Jenner's much-discussed (and much-critiqued) 2017 Pepsi ad.

<strong>The benefits of a brand makeover</strong>

Unlike a rebrand, which is a top to bottom re-imagination, a brand refresh functions more along the lines of a makeover. Even the most popular brands become stale over time. That's not due to any inherent flaws, but rather, public taste and sentiment is ever changing, and brands need to ensure that their identity remains aligned with these shifts.

Because a brand refresh is less comprehensive, many of the changes come closer to the margins. In the case of Pepsi, these changes meant a new tagline, new can designs, a song, and some other supporting marketing materials. Other typical changes may include new color schemes, new slogans, new product names, and new designs.

By introducing new elements, a brand positioning agency can assist companies in offering audiences a gentle reminder that they are still around and relevant. For legacy brands such as Pepsi, this is a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">critical strategic objective</a>. The product, is omnipresent and fairly unexciting. For as long as any of us can remember, it's been in existence. At restaurants, retail stores, stadiums, concert venues etc., cola is part of the landscape. That's not exactly a recipe for fierce brand loyalty.

This means that it's incumbent upon Pepsi's branding to build and sustain consumer relationships. Consumers grow old and change with age. Pepsi doesn't, so a refresh is necessary every five-to-ten years to help each generation identify (and ideally fall in love) with the brand.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

At BIGEYE, we believe that the right brand positioning agency can make a critical difference in the ultimate success or failure of any small to mid-sized business. If you're part of an established brand that isn't gaining enough market traction, it could be time to consider a well-executed refresh.

Warning: This blog post may lead to cuteness overload,"Any good brand development company knows that emotional resonance is one of the keys to great advertising. If you can move someone emotionally, there's an excellent chance you'll be moving some product soon afterward.

Obviously, not all emotions are created equal in this sense. Brands making a habit of sending audiences into a hot rage probably wouldn't be beneficial.

But joy? Wonder? Delight?

If you can master those feelings throughout your <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">brand messaging </a>the way Disney has, your brand has unlimited potential.

<strong>Disney and the science of ""cute overload""</strong>

You've probably noticed that people are naturally drawn to cute things, with babies, puppies, and kittens serving as exhibits A, B, and C.

But baby ducks might be the cutest of them all. Small, squeaky, and equipped with adorably goofy bills and oversized webbed feet, baby ducks are certainly in the Pantheon of Cuddly Animals.

Disney's <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/creativity/a-duckling-who-idolizes-donald-duck-will-melt-your-heart-in-this-disneyland-paris-ad/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent ad</a> showcasing its EuroDisney theme park exposed our collective love of baby ducks in brilliant fashion. <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/scripting-storyboard-company/"">The story plays out like this</a>: A tiny, lonely baby duck finds an old Donald Duck comic book in a field and is instantly infatuated. The duckling mimics Donald's poses and seems to spend all his time absorbed in the book's pages.

Unfortunately, a change of season comes in the form of a nasty thunderstorm and some seasonal migration. The duckling has to leave his beloved comic book behind, as he flies away to parts unknown with the rest of the flock.

In a heartwarming twist, however, the flock's new home just happens to be on the outskirts of EuroDisney. Who does the duckling see standing in front of the theme park? Donald Duck himself, resplendently clad in his customary three-sizes-too-small sailor suit.

The duckling runs to Donald, hugs him and closes his eyes in sheer bliss -- striking the same pose that millions of children visiting Disneyworld have also experienced after meeting Donald, Mickey, Minnie, etc.

It's a pretty brilliant advertisement -- even for a company that specializes in creating this kind of magic. If you're a brand or a brand development company, it also provides a good opportunity to examine just why this approach is so effective.

As it turns out, it's all in our DNA.

<strong>Why the cuteness sells</strong>

It's not uncommon to see someone pinch a baby's rosy red cheeks. Or, to hear someone utter the (slightly unnerving) phrase ""you're so cute I could just eat you up"" when in the presence of a baby.

So why do humans feel a compulsion to pinch and squeeze babies and puppies?

Science has an answer. According to <a href=""https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151010-science-psychology-babies-animals-culture-behavior/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a 2015 study</a> conducted by Yale psychologist Oriana Aragon, the feelings that adorably cute babies and animals inspire in us are so overwhelming that we instinctively follow them up with feelings of aggression. The general idea is that humans are designed to maintain emotional equilibrium. The presence of a baby (or an adorable duckling) sparks such an emotional reaction within us that we immediately compensate by thinking or acting in a more traditionally aggressive manner.

That's a fascinating finding -- and one with interesting implications for any brand development company, as well as the advertising and marketing industry as a whole. If emotional resonance is the Holy Grail of connecting with audiences, cuteness overload might be the map that helps brands discover it.

Why great marketing means thinking outside the (sandwich) box,"There's no denying that subscription services are hot. You can now have razors, meal kits and even a curated selection of candy from across the globe delivered to your door, weekly or monthly. This shift toward subscription goods is one reason why <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/packaging-design-agency/"">brand package design </a>has become increasingly important in recent years. A beautiful or visually arresting design can make regular delivery of expected goods feel almost like a gift.

Given the rising popularity of the subscription model, it's hardly surprising that brick and mortar businesses are attempting to join the party. What may surprise you, however, is the identity of some of these legacy brands.

<strong>How Arby's took ""thinking outside the box"" to a new level</strong>

In early January 2019, the fast-food franchise Arby's announced it would begin rolling out a new subscription service for sandwich lovers called ""Arby's of the Month.""

If you're breaking out in ""meat sweats"" at the thought of a limp, week-old roast beef sandwich arriving at your door, fear not: These boxes contain ""sandwich-inspired items"" rather than actual buns, beef and horsey sauce.

The first boxes were distributed to members of the ""Arby's of the Month"" club and contained the following <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">promotional items</a>: A visually pleasing brand package design with red and white Arby's ski hat, a scarf designed to look like a giant slice of bacon, temporary Arby's sandwich tattoos, a branded dining tray and a note from the company's so-called ""Head of Sandwiches"" promising five more months of Arby's themed goodies.

Arby's priced the six-month subscriptions for a flat $25 fee. While they quickly sold out, the company says it will alert consumers as soon as more subscriptions come available in the coming weeks.

<strong>Why Arby's chose the subscription box marketing route</strong>

Marketers can leverage larger societal trends to great effect. Look no further than Gillette's recent #metoo-inspired<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/business/gillette-masculinity-ad/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> </a><u><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/business/gillette-masculinity-ad/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">""We Believe"" ad</a>,</u> which gained massive attention while courting considerable controversy. Another example: Nike's 2018 campaign featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, which leveraged the football star's visibility as a social justice figure.

Now, a ""Sandwich of the Month"" club doesn't have the same gravitas. Yet it falls perfectly in line with Arby's playful, slightly goofy brand identity. Audiences don't expect a roast beef purveyor to create an idealistic, high-concept ad campaign focusing on human rights. A campaign that builds upon Americans' recent fascination with subscription delivery boxes -- presented in Arby's signature off-kilter style -- is perfectly pitched.

Merely choosing to use the subscription-based model isn't enough, however. For a truly successful campaign, Arby's needed two additional things: Delivery items that would delight their customers and an appealing box in which to contain them.

Arby's succeeded with the former -- after all, who wouldn't be amused by receiving a giant, flowing bacon scarf? For the latter, Arby's chose to partner with the ad agency Fallon, who came up with <u><a href=""https://www.adweek.com/creativity/arbys-launched-a-subscription-box-and-it-sold-out-in-less-than-an-hour/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a striking example</a> </u>of a strong brand package design to support the campaign.

Overall, Arby's delivered a clever, on-trend and on-brand campaign idea supported by great design and social media marketing. With those elements in place, it's little wonder that Arby's new promotion sold out almost immediately.

The art and science behind landing pages that convert,"If you were running a brick and mortar business, you wouldn't put extremely uncomfortable chairs in the lobby, or decorate in a manner that recalls the local DMV. Customers would quickly tire of their surroundings and depart. Yet many businesses are, in effect, doing the very same thing with their websites and landing pages -- making the services of a smart content marketing agency all the more important.

<strong>The art of great landing page design</strong>

Websites and landing pages are the public face of a business and reflect both the competencies and priorities of that enterprise. If your web pages are riddled with spelling or grammar issues, for example, it sends a terrible signal to prospective customers. If the site is cumbersome to use and not intuitive, customers will give up in frustration and fail to convert. Or, even worse, depart for a competitor's page.

So why use a content marketing agency? And what makes an appealing landing page? For the most part, it can be distilled to a few simple steps:

<strong>1. Simplicity and clean design</strong><strong> </strong>

Aesthetics are a key consideration when creating a landing page. A cluttered presentation is not only displeasing to the eye, but it also reduces functionality. Worse, it simply looks unprofessional. Good landing page design is clean, sleek, and simple. A landing page should always be designed around one key objective: A conversion.

<strong>2. Consistency in branding</strong>

All landing pages should display good continuity with the website as a whole. Logos and other branded elements should remain consistent as should brand voice.

<strong>3. Effortless navigation</strong>

Businesses can't afford to lose customers because of poor <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/ux-design-agency/"">design or UX</a>. A great landing page needs to close the deal. Landing page navigation should be intuitive and effortless, but also limited. You want the visitor to remain focused on converting, and too many navigational options may send them off in another direction, never to return.

<strong>4. A clear and compelling CTA</strong>

A great landing page has a succinct and persuasive pitch. Your call to action should also be prominently placed. Use appropriate color, design, and text elements to make your CTA stand out.

<strong>5. Refined, concise sales copy</strong>

A good landing page doesn't waste a single word. All copy should be calibrated to convert. Be direct, be compelling and explain the value proposition as simply as possible.

<strong>Other key tips</strong>

In addition to mastering design, tone, and voice, businesses should ensure that landing page functionality is a priority. Forms for collecting leads and social sharing options should be simple to use and work flawlessly. Because businesses are asking visitors to take an extra step when they fill out boxes or click to share, these processes need to be as frictionless as possible.

Testing is another key part of an effective landing page design. Running some simple A/B tests can help you determine which design elements are the most engaging, and help you make the choices that lead to maximizing conversions.

While there are many options for <u><a href=""https://mailchimp.com/features/landing-pages/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=whats-new-january-2019-engaged&amp;utm_content=landing-page-feature-page&amp;mc_cid=3b44e851b8&amp;mc_eid=722dcd81e5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">template-based do-it-yourself options</a> </u>for landing page design, businesses seeking to build the most professional and engaging pages possible should consider partnering with a content marketing agency that specializes in <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/""><u>design and website development</u></a>.

Understanding the intricacies of rebranding: Slack's logo refresh,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Slack is a corporate collaboration interface. It's been incredibly successful, growing into an $8 billion company with 8 million daily users in just over 5 years, and now it’s going public. To be more appealing to prospective investors they’ve rebranded, becoming more buttoned-up, sophisticated, and easy to scale. As a </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/"">marketing research agency</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, we’re diving into Slack’s rebrand to learn more about these changes, why they were made, and discuss whether we think these changes will be successful… or not.</span>

<strong>Let’s start with the practical</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Slack’s original design was a colorful hashtag. Sounds pretty simple, but it’s not. </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/"">Creative services</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have to scale and apply this logo all over collateral and in its upcoming IPO. Going public means more applications and rapid growth. According to Slack’s blog, the hashtag is made up of 11 different colors and must be placed at </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">exactly</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> 18 degrees off center. If any shading is done incorrectly or it’s placed on a background that isn’t just the right tint of white...well then the whole thing will simply look </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">wrong</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. That alone is enough to drive any </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> crazy, but throw in the fact that rapid growth means more differentiated collateral, and it’s more than enough to warrant revisiting the logo.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using Pentagram as their </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/"">marketing strategy agency</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Slack is repositioning the brand from a fun, playful hashtag to a youthful adult brand. Keeping the logo bright and colorful, they’ve remained young, but moving to a more solid, static, and upright logo does age the brand a bit. To bring back in the hashtag’s lighthearted and lively energy, Slack’s </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/"">branding agency</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> added what they call “droplets” to mimic the movement and tilted alignment of the original logo. </span>

<strong>The difficulty of rebranding</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moving away from the execution, there’s the fact that it’s difficult to rebrand a well-established, public company. Looking to the future, how would an 11-color hashtag age? 10 years from now, would it be an appealing logo? Our </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/"">web design company</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is leaning on the side of no. The hashtag is a popular symbol right now, but as time goes on, trends fade. Objectively, a hashtag is not all that aesthetically compelling and the transparency levels throughout this logo can make the whole thing appear too soft. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An important angle to look at is recognition. The new logo is not all that similar to the hashtag. When put right next to each other, it’s easy to understand the progression… but apart? These “droplets” and “lozenges” don’t exactly scream Slack, which is why timing is everything. Yes, Slack is an established brand, but being released in August of 2013, it’s only around 5 years old. As a young brand, in more ways than one, this rebrand is perfectly timed: before going public, where they’d need shareholder approval and after achieving a solid consumer base.  </span>

<strong>Building a brand foundation</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to branding, it’s not just the symbolism, scalability, and awareness that needs to be considered—there’s also application. Branding needs to be a solid foundation for any company across platforms. As a successful </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/"">multi-platform media buying agency</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, we like to explore the implications of redesign across media and devices. A static, non-transparent logo that can be applied on any background is far more effective. The old hashtag could only be posted certain ways on specific collateral due to its incredibly complicated execution, which limits the brand just when it’s about to grow exponentially. This new logo will drive brand awareness and recognition rapidly with the upcoming IPO.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The application applies to more than collateral and static postings. A logo should be dynamic, drawing attention at every single touchpoint. Let’s start with </span>social media marketing services<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. On every social media platform, your profile has a picture. As far as business pages go, more often than not the logo becomes the profile picture. With how particularly the hashtag has to be placed, this new, much more dynamic logo would make building social pages so much easier.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Building out a video and social, influencers can be indispensable when assisting a rapidly growing brand to extend their reach. From what we’ve seen with our own </span>influencer marketing agency<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, having the right people, in the right place, saying the right things can make or break your brand growth. As far as this aspect goes, the new branding is definitely the right choice. As mentioned before, the old logo is not easy to post anywhere, and influencers post using your brand aesthetics. The easier your logo, colors, and style are to apply, the more effective your influencers will be.</span>

<strong>Mass communications</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the knowledge, we have from our own </span><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/"">PR &amp; media relations agency</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> we know that the final PR posts are often not done by the company that has the announcement. This means that the company that is finalizing the post is the one that places the creative. This brings back in the hoops that an agency has to jump through to effectively apply the hashtag logo, the new logo streamlines the communications cycle to get Slack’s brand out there rapidly.</span>

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This new branding is a smart move that builds up Slack for long-term sustainability. When it comes to the application of logos, this new design makes life easier on almost all counts. The hashtag lends itself better to placement and collateral creation. This symbol made up of “droplets” and “lozenges” create a mark that is engaging, strong, and unique. Armin Vit from Brand New said it best in his review entitled “Hash it Out”, “It [the new logo] captures the premise of the platform in a more interpretive way than the literal hashtag and, again, it’s simply a good-looking mark.” As far as changing an established, well-recognized brand goes, now is the best time to do it. Once Slack goes public later this year, huge changes like rebranding would have to be approved by the shareholders. Also, this IPO should signify rapid growth, and after there’s widespread recognition for Slack’s logo changing it becomes a less appealing move. Lastly, Slack is young, just over 5 years old, so this redesign won’t hurt its standing much. In planning for </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">w</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">idespread </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">branding</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that lasts</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, this redesign is the right choice.</span>

"Hey Alexa, why is NLP revolutionizing marketing?","Remember the first iteration of Siri on the iPhone 4s? She was charming but clunky - and ended up being more of a curiosity rather than a real voice assistant. Today, however, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are both powerful and deeply integrated into our daily lives, thanks to advances in natural language processing (NLP). If you're a brand or a digital marketing agency, these advances <a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-nlp-5bff2b2a7170"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">in NLP</a> can also be used to help create more effective and engaging campaigns.

<strong>The evolution of NLP</strong>

Natural language processing draws on computer science, linguistics, machine learning, sophisticated language modeling, and analysis to allow computers to generate and understand human language. In essence, it's the technology that allows computers to finally interact with us in an intuitive, seamless -- and human sounding -- fashion.

The introduction of smartphones and other mobile devices made communicating, working and performing basic life tasks easier and more efficient. Smart speakers and other NLP-equipped devices are taking things a step further. Instead of mediating interactions through a keyboard, we can navigate with simple voice commands to a sophisticated <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/voice-engineering-services/"">AI-based voice assistant</a>.

As you might expect, this is not an easy endeavor, as language is deeply complex; until the last few years, NLP-equipped devices were limited in functionality and were largely unable to have advanced, human-like conversations. Humans pick up complex language because we are naturally hardwired to understand it; machines, however, have no such innate advantage.

Today, NLP technology has taken a quantum leap forward and is now being used in smart speakers, chatbots, and predictive text suggestions -- the kind you see in search engines, email, and <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">smartphones</a>. It also has an important role to play in another human endeavor with digital marketing agencies.

<strong>How NLP is transforming the way we live, work and sell</strong>

The business of marketing has become incredibly data-driven in recent years. In order to effectively market and sell products and services, businesses need to target the right audiences. In order to do that, they need a way to identify who they mean to target -- and that's where data analysis enters the equation.

There's still one significant challenge, however: More than 90% of the data that's generated online falls into the category of ""unstructured data."" This includes emails, reviews, social media posts, etc. Because this information is not classified or structured -- and because enormous amounts exist and are being continually generated -- it's difficult for marketers or anyone else to make sense of it, let alone derive actionable insights. Which is where a digital marketing agency &amp; NLP come together.

NLP offers one solution to this problem. <a href=""https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/why-natural-language-processing-is-the-next-disruptor-for-marketing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">One recent example:</a> EssayPro, an online service that helps students become better writers, uses NLP to analyze unstructured data in an effort to better understand the problems students have when composing their papers. It then applies these insights to its marketing strategies, targeting students with specific solutions to the precise problems with which they are dealing with.

Businesses can also use NLP to conduct <a href=""https://www.smartfocus.com/en/blog/how-can-nlp-technology-be-used-marketing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sentiment analysis</a> and identify propensity signals on social media. By analyzing this data, brands can learn -- almost in real time -- how audiences are responding to goods, services, and marketing messages.

NLP can also be used to help businesses that gather high volumes of customer feedback through chats, emails, voicemails, and social media posts. By applying NLP to this data, businesses can unlock deeper insights into customer experience, and make any necessary adjustments to their marketing strategies.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

We believe great campaigns require more than compelling creative work -- they also need to be supported by a sophisticated understanding of the latest technological tools.

How brands are winning over customers by being genuinely authentic,"You don't need to run a branding agency to understand that consumers crave authenticity. Given that most of us are continually bombarded with advertising and marketing, it's natural that we seek messages that connect on something deeper than a purely commercial level.

Technology has exacerbated our impatience with inauthentic branding. We live in an age of Instagram filters, perfectly curated social media accounts, Photoshop, and even <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/in-a-digitalized-world-consumers-yearn-for-authenticity-from-brands/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">outright digital manipulation</a>. In an environment where people are surrounded by the phony and the superficial, it's little wonder that they desire something raw, real and unmediated.

And that's a desire that today's savviest brands are trying to accommodate.

<strong>Two tips for creating authentic connections</strong>

We've established that people crave authenticity. So now let's talk about two strategies that brands can execute to <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">create messaging that resonates</a>.

<strong>1. Be human when developing your brand voice</strong>

For as long as consumer society has existed, its primary mode of communication has been a bland, neutered form of corporate-speak, designed to minimize the odds that someone, somewhere might take offense. Yet while this tone may not offend anyone, it's also not going to challenge, engage or excite anyone, either. Time to take a risk!

Too often small to mid-sized businesses adopt this generic brand voice out of insecurity -- they mistakenly believe they will be perceived as ""unprofessional"" if they opt for something too colorful, lively, edgy, etc.

The truth, however, is that people want to hear brands speak in human-sounding language. They want brands to interact with them the same way that people in their social networks do. This is partially because Twitter and other social platforms are absolutely overrun with bots. A <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent Pew study</a> showed that an astonishing 66% of shared links on Twitter were generated by bots, versus utilizing a branding agency.

In order to be perceived as authentic, brands must speak in a recognizably human voice. They should also be familiar with the social conventions of the platforms on which they are communicating.

Fast food companies <a href=""https://www.prweek.com/article/1453072/top-10-brands-nailed-twitter-2017"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">are the masters</a> of this kind of consumer marketing interaction. KFC, Burger King, Arby's and other chains love to propagate clever memes on Twitter and poke sly fun at themselves. They are also highly adept at taking trending topics and relating it to their own brand -- and people, of course, <a href=""https://people.com/food/best-fast-food-tweets/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eat it up</a>(no pun intended).

<strong>2. Standing up -- and standing out -- for a good cause</strong>

Over the last year, we've seen several examples of brands creating an authentic connection with consumers by taking a public stand on social issues. Patagonia's ""<a href=""https://www.patagonia.com/protect-public-lands.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The President Stole Your Land</a>"" was a fierce bit of advocacy marketing. It delivered a stinging indictment of a powerful figure couched in simple language. It was also deeply authentic and perfectly in line with Patagonia's brand identity.

Gillette's famously polarizing<a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a25934344/gillette-ad-controversy-toxic-masculinity-explained/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> ""toxic masculinity"" ad</a> was a much larger gamble, as its message wasn't guaranteed to resonate with much of the company's customer base. Though it was criticized in some quarters, it was joyously received in others, while raising Gillette's brand profile exponentially.

Brands will often attempt to earn goodwill and position themselves as good citizens by offering general statements of support for various social causes or donating money. These gestures, though well-intentioned, are usually forgotten almost immediately. Not so with Patagonia and Gillette, who turned their social advocacy into a deeply felt, authentic message.

Simple yet breathtakingly beautiful video ads is all it takes,"At this point, we've all heard countless messages about the critical role video plays in a modern marketing strategy. Yet we're still surrounded by video content that's flat, un-engaging and uninspiring. Many brands understand the importance of video, but simply lack the expertise, capacity or creative ability to translate this into something tangible. By partnering with a top video production company, however, you can turn even the simplest of video concepts into something truly magnetic.

<strong>The blooming of a brilliant idea</strong>

In video marketing and advertising, the best ideas are often the simplest. This was made evident by a <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/creativity/simple-and-spectacular-this-patiently-crafted-ad-transforms-flowers-into-fireworks/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">stunning video ad </a>recently created by the advertising firm TBWA/Paris on behalf of the French railway firm SNCF. The goal was to create an ad that thanked riders for reducing their carbon footprint by choosing to ride the train.

The ensuing idea was elegantly simple: Plants blooming set to a score of fireworks popping. Now, if you were to throw that pitch out at a creative meeting, you'd likely get a positive response -- something along the lines of ""Oh, that's nice -- very clever."" Flowers blooming resemble fireworks exploding, and both are colorful.

Once that seed of an idea blooms onscreen, however, the response becomes very different. The TBWA/Paris ad is breathtakingly beautiful, featuring gorgeous high definition video of exotic flowers in bloom. Yet because TBWA/Paris <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/video-editing-company/"">synchronized each movement </a>of the blooming flowers to the sound of exploding fireworks, the experience goes beyond beauty -- the viewer marvels at the interpolation. They are very different, yet somehow the same.

That's the power of truly creative video production in action.

<strong>Tips for creating memorable video content</strong>

In order to <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/"">create video content that connects</a>, it's important, to begin with, a strong concept. However, there are also a variety of other smart practices you can follow to help ensure that your message is a memorable one. These include:

<strong>Shorter videos</strong>

Thanks to the five-second skip, consumers often exercise little patience with videos. Multi-minute videos are generally best left to master directors and storytellers, or high-profile brands that can afford to cast well-known actors. For everyone else, it's better to aim for maximum impact in the briefest possible time. Data from Facebook and Instagram shows that <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/help/144240239372256?helpref=page_content"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>15 seconds or less</u></a> is ideal for businesses creating a mobile video.

<strong>Keep it simple</strong>

If you're going to create shorter videos, you need to work from simple concepts. Cut out the filler and focus on the core message.

<strong>Emphasize the beginning</strong><strong> </strong>

Great videos seize the viewer's attention immediately. Today's consumers won't sit still for too long of a buildup or exposition -- you need to grab their focus in the first few seconds and refuse to let go.

<strong>Make it emotionally resonant</strong>

Nothing builds connections and increases engagement like an emotional investment. It doesn't have to be sappy or cloying, either; the TBWA/Paris flower ad creates a connection by emphasizing the wonder and beauty of nature.

<strong>Tailor it to your audience</strong>

A great video is one that is tailored to your specific audience but can still be universally appreciated.

The TBWA/Paris ad shows us how a simple yet clever idea can be elevated dramatically through video. Not every business, of course, has the skill, capacity or resources to develop this kind of video.

That doesn't mean that a great video is out of reach -- a talented video production company can help make this a reality.

<strong>Choosing the Right Video Production Company</strong>

Our requisite creative skills, technical abilities, and industry experiences allow us to create deeply memorable, creatively inspiring video ads that are exponential.

Struggling for good content? Consider the UGC technique,"It's a fact of life that creative brand consulting firms are always in need of fresh and compelling content. Unfortunately, they often struggle to meet these demands. That's because it typically requires time, talent and money to generate high-quality marketing content.

Here's the good news: Agencies and brands are solving this problem with content generation strategies that ensure access to a consistent pipeline of high-value material.

One of the most overlooked of these strategies is the use of UGC -- or ""user-generated content.""

<strong>Who's down with UGC? </strong>

UGC is simply defined as <a href=""https://hackernoon.com/ugc-the-secret-marketing-tactic-most-brands-never-use-9db2f87272b7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>any content created and shared by consumers</u></a>, fans or any unpaid contributor. This content often takes the form of videos, photos, testimonials, social media posts, and stories.

One recent example: Coca-Cola's wildly successful personalized Coke bottle campaign. The beverage giant replaced its iconic logo with 250 popular first names and sold hundreds of millions of bottles of cola as a result.

As part of its product rollout, Coca-Cola asked consumers to <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">upload photos and videos </a>of themselves drinking from their personalized bottles. Thousands did, giving Coca-Cola free content and advertising -- and providing a great example of the power of UGC in action.

Coca-Cola isn't the only beverage company to use UGC to great effect. Pepsi's ""Max It Now"" campaign was built around legendary NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon, who famously raced under the number 24.

Pepsi asked fans to complete 24 social media challenges (such as Tweeting why Pepsi Max is better than Coke Zero in 24 words, or Instagraming a photo of themselves with Pepsi Max) in order to win prizes.

This UGC campaign was hailed for the way it engaged with a dedicated cohort of so-called ""superfans” a.k.a people with deep loyalty to Jeff Gordon, NASCAR -- and now, very possibly, Pepsi Max.

<strong>Tips for your next UGC campaign</strong>

We've discussed one benefit of UGC -- providing access to a stream of valuable content, an eternal need for brands. Yet there's another important advantage: UGC resonates with audiences.

Why? People perceive non-commercial content generated by people like themselves to be more authentic. Similar to word of mouth advertising, they also perceive UGC to be more trustworthy than conventional marketing or advertising. In today's ad-soaked environment, more consumers than ever simply tune out anything with an overtly commercial feel. UGC cuts through this barrier.

Additionally, a UGC campaign allows brands to place consumers front and center. Rather than dictate the story through a creative brand consulting firm, UGC campaigns allow consumers to play a key role in telling the brands journey themselves. When this occurs, brands create campaigns that connect on a more personal level, while also encouraging consumers to feel like they are invested in the campaign -- and by extension the brand itself.

So now that we've established why UGC works, let's review a few tips for <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">your next campaign</a>:

<strong>1.Create excitement and anticipation</strong>

This is one of the best ways to ensure that you receive strong user participation. Set a content submission date and spend the days and weeks ahead of that date building anticipation across all relevant marketing channels.

<strong> 2.Offer creative awards for participation</strong>

This is the key to engaging with people who aren't already dedicated fans of a brand. Public recognition, company swag or prizes help people feel like their work <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/harald-merckel-guest-post-user-generated-content/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>is worth it.</u></a>

<strong>3.Ensure your campaign is legally compliant</strong>

Is your campaign a sweepstakes (random drawing) or a contest (with criteria to meet)? Depending on your jurisdiction, these may have <a href=""https://mashable.com/2013/01/30/brand-marketing-user-generated-content/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>differing legal requirements</u></a>. Check with an attorney if you have any questions.

Why increased sales and conversions begin with Z,"If you're seeking more conversions (and who isn't?), there's good news: By partnering with a top media planning agency, you can develop a new, personalization-based strategy that targets perhaps the most important demographic in advertising and marketing today: Generation Z.

<strong>Generation Z: Powerful enough to challenge the digital ad duopoly</strong>

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/consumer-customer-profile-services/"">Generation Z</a> (roughly defined as anyone born between 1995 and 2015) are now the largest age cohort in the U.S., according to Bloomberg. Yet sheer size isn't the only reason why this generation should be top of mind for marketers; Gen Z, like Millennials before them, has come of age. They're amassing buying power, entering the work force in vast numbers, and driving the consumer economy.

Brands and agencies that devoted extraordinary resources to unmasking the secrets to Millennial marketing are casting an evaluating eye on Gen Z. Those who best understand younger consumers will reap sizeable benefits -- and those who don't may get left behind.

Even the most powerful entities have plenty of skin in this game. Google and Facebook, the seemingly omnipotent Digital Ad Duopoly, are facing serious regulatory scrutiny over their privacy and data management practices.

The real existential risk to this duopoly doesn't come from a legislator's pen, however. Instead, it's the needs, wants, desires and habits of Gen Z that pose the most pressing challenge.

Facebook has been hemorrhaging younger users for years, and is largely irrelevant to Gen Z, though its other properties (Instagram and WhatsApp) remain very popular with younger users. YouTube, also, remains a popular Gen Z platform.

Brands need to be acutely aware that consumer loyalty is more fickle than ever. The process of discovering an app, falling in love with it, and then dropping it for something else has accelerated. Gen Z, in particular, is <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/gen-z-will-dismantle-the-duopoly-unless-theyre-taken-more-seriously/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>fluid in their app choices</u>.</a> This makes even the most established platforms vulnerable.

Yet these very same characteristics also present an opportunity for brands savvy enough to recognize them. By gaining a deeper understanding of Gen Z consumers, brands can anticipate what they want, provide them with the kind of advertising and marketing messages that resonate, and ultimately increase sales.

<strong>Targeting generation Z</strong>

So now that we understand why Gen Z is so critical to effective advertising and marketing, let's discuss a few things brands need to know when creating personalized campaigns with media planning agencies.

<strong>Gen Z is driven by values</strong>

<a href=""https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/generation-z-research-1202668831/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">More than 60% </a>of Gen Z say they are ""socially conscious."" These values drive their decisions in terms of purchasing and patronage: More than half of Gen Z members say they are more likely to support a brand that signals support for charitable, environmental or social causes.

<strong>Gen Z strongly dislikes conventional online ads</strong><strong> </strong>

While older generations may tolerate irrelevant digital ads that interrupt their viewing or reading experience, younger people are far less forgiving -- and far more likely to use ad-suppressing technological tools, such as the Brave web browser. In order to succeed, brands will need to accommodate these preferences by delivering personalized, targeted and highly relevant ads through <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-research-agency/focus-groups-research-company/"">channels that young people prefer</a> (Snapchat and Instagram Stories, for example).

<strong>Half-baked attempts at connection will backfire</strong>

An example: Google created a guide to Gen Z called ""It's Lit"" -- and was greeted with widespread derision as a result. Younger consumers are marketing savvy and will instantly spot (and ridicule) a ham-handed attempt at being culturally relevant. Brands should instead take the time to study the online behavior of Gen Z through the lens of the <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/gen-z-and-youtube/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><u>platforms they use.</u></a>

Creative and media under one roof: The agency model of the future,"Creative and media went their separate ways more than 30 years ago, when big New York agencies determined they could charge clients more money for distinct services. Today, however, we're seeing a reversal of that trend: Large industry holding companies (Publicis Groupe, WPP, etc.) are organizing media and creative under one roof -- a development that bears very close scrutiny for anyone in <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/"">creative brand consulting.</a>

<strong>Why an integrated service model makes sense</strong>

Synergy may be a buzzword, but it describes a very real advantage that can be seized when the individual parts of an organization work together to achieve more than they could in isolation.

The recent <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/burger-sales-quadrupled-after-ihop-became-ihob/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">""IHOb"" ad campaign</a> on behalf of the International House of Pancakes is a nice recent example of this process in motion. The campaign, which cleverly stoked social media buzz about a potential name change for the legacy pancake purveyor, was the combined creation of Initiative and Droga5, <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-planning-agency/"">media </a>and creative agencies working under the umbrella of IPG. The campaign, which earned industry praise, allowed IHOP to develop impactful creative work, and then increase the impact and reach of its distribution.

This encompasses the overarching concept of consolidation within the space, in which ad clients are increasingly folding all of their needs into a single agency or holding company. Many observers contend that this model -- which theoretically allows creative, media, and data analytics to work synergistically -- is better suited for modern advertising.

By rolling services together, campaigns can be adjusted in real time to account for the reaction of audiences. Campaigns can also leverage data to shape the direction creative takes, allowing for more refined messages and better audience targeting.

<strong>Why is this shift occurring now?  </strong>

Delivering ad services in a piecemeal fashion has been a revenue driver for the last few decades, as companies could shift away from a flat commission model taken by separate on media and creative initiatives. Many of the ad industry's new leaders, however, no longer believe this model is optimal, according to Madwell CEO David Eisenman.

Eisenman <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/agencies/more-agency-consolidation-may-be-coming-as-creative-and-media-converge-again/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">told Adweek</a> that 90% of the RFPs his agency received in the last year included creative and media elements. This change, he said, has been driven by Millennials, who are stepping into the advertising C-suite and bringing a fresh perspective.

Publicis Groupe, one of the industry's key players, has been pursuing an integrated model since restructuring its organization in 2015. The company streamlined all operations into four so-called ""solutions hubs"" that comprise all corporate business.

Under this model, the holding company acts as chief business delegator, helping coordinate client services with its constituent agencies underneath. Ultimately, the talent spread across various agencies can be tapped to service a single client, allowing for the most efficient spread of resources. This, of course, benefits clients -- why only have access to creative brand consulting in one talent housed agency when you can access teams spread across an entire holding company?

<strong>Concerns and drawbacks</strong>

While an integrated model seems to be a winner for clients, some observers have cautioned that excessive integration may lead to problems. Creatives may not always appreciate being spread across an organization, mercenary-style, to work on seemingly random projects.

Additionally, if integration is handled poorly, quality may suffer. Firms that pursue widespread integration need to be certain that it is implemented carefully and methodically, given its potential for organizational disruption.

Dramatically improve your content marketing strategy in 4 steps,"There's no doubt that <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescontentmarketing/2019/03/01/5-content-marketing-stats-that-will-help-you-reach-your-audience/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">content marketing</a> is a critically important differentiator for businesses. The industry is experiencing <a href=""https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/content-marketing/why-content-marketing-is-set-to-be-an-industry-worth-41288-billion-by-2021/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">explosive growth</a>, and top content marketing agencies are busier than ever.

Yet many organizations remain dissatisfied with the results their strategies are generating. They watch competitors gain traction, yet can't replicate their success.

Other agencies find initial success, but have difficulty creating a sustainable pipeline of fresh, interesting content. And that's understandable -- the ideation and execution processes aren't easy, and most content marketing plans require a continuous stream of new material. That's a stiff -- and time sensitive -- challenge.

Fortunately, jumpstarting a tired or ineffective content process doesn't typically require a massive overhaul. In many cases, a few relatively minor tweaks can dramatically improve the reach and engagement of your content.

With that in mind, let's take a closer look at a few tactics businesses can use to significantly improve results.

<strong>1.Explore new content mediums</strong>

Content diversity is an important part of an overall content marketing agencies strategy. This doesn't merely apply to idea generation, however; it's also important to offer audiences a variety of different mediums through which to consume content.

Incorporating more videos, infographics, scripted animations, etc. can help break up monotony and engage audiences on a deeper level. You don't need to be Steven Spielberg or a design wizard to get started, either. Something as simple as a ""behind the scenes"" video featuring members of your organization can help audiences connect with you and build a stronger bond.

<strong>2.Audit existing SEO practices</strong>

The best practices in the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) realm change at a dizzying rate. It's imperative to stay current, however, as SEO is absolutely critical to any distribution strategy. If you develop the most interesting content in the industry -- but nobody sees it -- what have you really accomplished?

In order to ensure that your content is widely accessible, it's a smart idea to audit your SEO practices on a rolling basis. While most companies can do simple keyword research and content optimization, it's necessary to partner with a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">digital agency</a> with specialized skill and expertise in order to get the most out of your SEO efforts.

<strong>3.Target niche audiences</strong>

Taking an overly broad approach is one of the single biggest mistakes businesses make when it comes to content strategy. When you try to speak to everyone, you often end up speaking to no one. Your content simply isn't relevant enough to engage and sustain interest.

Smart <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-company/"">content marketing agencies</a> understand the value of niche audiences. They tend to be highly engaged and motivated, always searching for new and relevant content that falls within their niche. Find out where these audiences live online, create interesting content that's optimized for their interest -- and you'll be amazed by the reception.

<strong>4.Take a more data-driven approach</strong>

At this point, we're all aware of the value of data -- many of today's most valuable companies are dedicated to collecting, analyzing, and selling out information. Surprisingly, however, many small to mid-sized businesses fail to adequately leverage data in their content marketing strategies.

Evaluating key performance indicators (such as traffic, conversions, engagement rates, etc.) can help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your approach. To maximize the value of a data-driven approach, however, you may need to expand beyond basic indicators by partnering with a top <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience segmentation</a> expert -- one that specializes in data-driven audience analysis.

"The ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" of marketing to gamers","Pop quiz: How familiar are you with Discord, Twitch, and Fortnite? If your answer is ""not very,"" you're probably not in a strong position to market to the gaming community.

That's a significant loss, as gaming has long transcended its geek subculture roots. Roughly 67% of Americans <a href=""https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2018/over-half-of-the-211-2-million-video-gamers-in-the-u-s--play-games-across-multiple-platforms--according-to-npd/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">(211 million people)</a> play video games. Nearly half of those people play video games at least three hours each week.

Consumer spending on video games reached <a href=""https://www.marketingcharts.com/cross-media-and-traditional/videogames-traditional-and-cross-channel-105597"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">$19.5 billion</a> in the first half of 2018 -- a 40% year-over-year increase, which is exceptional for a mature market.

Numbers such as these provide a window into the massive size of the gaming market. Video games, aided by the ubiquity of smartphones, have become an ingrained part of our culture.

As such, it's now a critical --and under-leveraged -- segment for marketers. To help you better understand how to market to gamers, let's take a closer look at some critical ""dos"" and don'ts"" involved with the process.

<strong>Why twitch-ing is essential </strong>

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/live-streaming-production-company/"">Live streaming</a> platforms (like the aforementioned Twitch) have been critical to the growth of gaming. These platforms allow gamers to broadcast their own in-game exploits to a global audience, earning feedback -- and often donations -- in the process. It's a business model that older demographics don't always immediately grasp (people <em>really </em>pay to watch other people play video games?)

The answer is yes, and in massive numbers. Twitch's growth has been nothing short of explosive (Amazon paid nearly $1 billion for the platform, which now has 15 million daily users).

Twitch and other live streaming platforms have  been a vehicle for another market experiencing extraordinary growth: Esports. For the uninitiated, Esports are the gaming equivalent of professional sports leagues. Pro gamers compete in leagues based on popular titles (such as Overwatch and NBA2K) and earn significant sums of prize money and endorsements as a result.

Leveraging Twitch as a marketing channel is certainly a ""do"" if you're seeking to engage gamers. The easiest way is through influencer marketing -- a practice that's extremely popular within live streaming circles. Brands seeking to appeal to gamers through <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/"">influencer marketing</a> will have no shortage of possibilities on Twitch, as influencer monetization is one of the primary goals of many of the platform's 3 million monthly broadcasters.

Brands can partner with influencers and run pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll ads. Commercials can also be run periodically. The roster of brands pursuing influencer marketing on Twitch is impressive: KFC, Kellogg's, and Duracell are just a few.

One important Twitch marketing ""don't"": Failing to do your research. Twitch broadcasters can be pretty freewheeling in terms of content, so it's important for brands to vet each potential partner by reviewing archived content.

<strong>The power of community-based gamer marketing</strong>

Discord is a voice and text app that targets the gaming community. If you want to find where hard-core gamers spend their time online, look no further.

Because Discord allows you to create communities, it can be an indispensable tool for brands that are seeking to engage with gamers. You can easily create groups, assign admins and moderators, and invite new members.

Once a new group is up and running, brands can share information about upcoming events, <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/business-promotional-items-materials-agency/"">offer special promotions</a> and simply engage with the community. Access to gamers isn't the only benefit of the platform; its native features make the platform more conducive to community building, and a better option for reaching the most dedicated gamers, than more limited platforms such as Twitter or Instagram.

When launching a new Discord channel, it's important to garner as much attention as possible. Prizes or special offerings for the first 100, 1,000 or 10,000 members is a smart way to encourage participation -- and a gamer marketing ""do.""

Once a channel is operational, core marketing principles need to apply. Brands need to ensure Discord channels are engaging, active, and conversant with the natural environment.

Gamers have an uncanny ability to sniff out brands that make ham-handed attempts at relevance or connection. Engaging gamers without doing your homework first is a definite marketing ""don't."" Brands that want to be successful with the most hard core gamers need to make sure that their marketing efforts are sufficiently steeped in the culture.

<strong>Mobile games and cultural sensations</strong>

When creating a marketing strategy for gamers, it's also important to remember that the world's most popular gaming platform isn't a Nintendo Switch or Playstation 4 -- it's the <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/its-time-for-brands-to-stop-ignoring-the-mobile-gaming-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">smartphone in your pocket</a>.

Ignoring mobile gamers is a serious ""don't,"" as they comprise an enormous chunk of all gaming activity. <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">Mobile apps</a> such as Candy Crush, Pokemon Go, Words With Friends, etc. are used daily by a staggering 78% of smartphone users.

One final do: Leveraging the brand power of the world's most popular games. Fortnite, for example, is a global phenomenon, generating more than $300 million each month for its publisher. Fortnite has also generated countless amounts of fan-generated content: Fail videos, viral dance challenges, etc.

Brands are working overtime to <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/fortnites-explosion-in-popularity-is-opening-new-doors-for-marketers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">integrate their marketing and advertising efforts</a> with cultural juggernauts like Fortnite -- making such practices a certifiable ""do"" for anyone seeking to reach gamers.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Given the size and growth of the space, gamer marketing has enormous potential. Yet many small to mid-sized businesses have failed to pursue this strategy because they lack subject expertise and a deep understanding of gaming culture.

That's where BIGEYE enters the picture. We help brands target the gaming market by devising engaging marketing strategies that gamers find relevant -- and businesses find profitable. Please don't hesitate to<a href=""http://bigeyeagency.com/contact/""> contact us today </a>for more information.

Want a great ad campaign? Deliver an out-of-home experience,"<em>Three billboards inside Orlando, Florida.</em>

Sounds like an Oscar-nominated film, right? In reality, it's a simple and underused advertising strategy that can deliver serious results. By working with a top local media buying agency, businesses can reap the substantial benefits offered by <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"">out-of-home advertising</a>.

Let's take a closer look at why this approach has proven remarkably resilient -- and effective -- in a world that's leaving other legacy advertising approaches behind.

<strong>The value of an out-of-home experience</strong>

Mobile ads, OTT ads, and other digital approaches are certainly exciting, valuable, and worthy of the attention they receive. It's important, however, for businesses to find value wherever they can. Sometimes it's more profitable to zig when the competition is engaged in synchronized zagging.

In this case, we're talking about conventional advertising methods that may lack buzz, but still pack a punch in terms of practical results. Out-of-home advertising is one great example; it's no one's idea of bleeding-edge adtech, but it has particular attributes that make it especially well suited to today's market. This is one reason why it's becoming increasingly popular with brands and media buying agencies.

Why are billboards effective? One key reason is context. We're deluged with digital advertising, and naturally have grown somewhat immune to it. While we'd probably wager that someone somewhere has actually watched a YouTube ad without hitting the skip button, we've never actually encountered such an individual. In the same vein, there are probably people who watch TV ads instead of immediately picking up their phone, but they are undoubtedly a rare breed.

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/services/"">Billboards and other forms of advertising</a>, on the other hand, are harder to tune out. We don't have the same conditioned response to ignore them. The scale is vastly larger. They have a physical presence that tiny screens lack. Additionally, modern technology (including 5G) can be used to deliver billboard ads dynamically, allowing for better targeting.

As these technologies grow more refined, it's not hard to envision a day when out-of-home installations can display hundreds or thousands of individual ads programmatically, based on the interests or characteristics of those passing by.

If the inherent benefits of the outdoor model are combined with creative, eye-catching content and execution, the end result can charm, intrigue and even astonish audiences -- as you can see in the following two examples.

<strong>Two great out-of-home experiences in 2018</strong>

Beer-maker Corona used out-of-home advertising to create a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/outdoor-marketing-agency/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">deeply memorable ad campaign</a> pegged to World Oceans Day. The company built a massive digital billboard depicting a beautiful ocean scene -- then installed a ""wave"" made from huge piles of trash directly in front of the billboard. Passersby could even deposit their own trash on the pile.

The outdoor installation drew attention to the fact that eight million metric tons of plastic is dumped into the world's oceans every year -- while earning Corona global media attention and goodwill.

McDonald's, meanwhile, turned eight of its popular <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/mcdonalds-turned-8-popular-menu-items-into-weather-icons-for-these-real-time-billboards/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">menu items into weather icons</a> on a giant billboard in London. The billboard delivered a real time weather forecast for pedestrians, using Big Macs to denote sun and upside down fries to indicate rain.

The billboards were especially effective in that they gave Londoners very useful information delivered in a highly unusual and eye-catching form -- one that also might just spark an appetite for a burger or fries.

These examples are indicative of a larger trend toward out of home ads. According to Magna, out-of-home advertising saw <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/why-are-advertisers-still-excited-by-ooh"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">4.6% growth</a> in 2018, a much higher figure than seen with any other legacy medium.

Want to convert like never before? Then start thinking small,"It's natural for businesses to focus on things like product purchases. Yet these ""big conversions"" only paint part of the overall picture. If you're looking to better understand your audience, it's also important to focus on micro-conversions -- and a <u><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">top digital marketing agency</a> </u>or video production company can play a critical role in this process.

Let's take a closer look at how macro and micro conversions differ, and how brands can optimize the latter to improve the former.

<strong>Macro and micro-conversions explained</strong>

Macro conversions (such as sales and signups) are generally supported by a series of smaller actions and milestones. These complementary actions are called micro conversions, and often play an equally important part of the overall process.

Some of the most common forms of micro-conversions include:
<ul>
 	<li>Video views</li>
 	<li>Comments left on blogs, webpages etc.</li>
 	<li>Adding products to a cart</li>
 	<li>Page views</li>
 	<li>Shared social media content</li>
</ul>
These micro-conversions are key benchmarks in the overall conversion process as they provide a window into consumer interactions within your marketing framework. If consumers have positive micro events, they are more likely to continue along the path toward a macro conversion. A negative interaction, however, can derail the process completely.

<strong>Optimizing micro-conversions</strong>

The importance of micro-conversions means that it is critical for brands to pursue optimization. Consumer pain points should be addressed and user experience should be prioritized in order to help ensure a macro conversion.

Some of the micro-conversion optimization techniques that brands should consider pursuing include:

<strong>Simple to use Web forms that are intuitive and allow users to save progress</strong>

Nothing irks consumers more than having to fill out forms multiple times, so it's essential to give them the ability to return to a form at their convenience.

<strong>E-books, white papers, and other downloadable lead magnets</strong>

While these require significant resources to create, they can be an invaluable tool for generating new business.

<strong>Customer reviews</strong>

Today's consumers immediately turn to reviews generated by their peers to ascertain the quality of a product or service. Strong reviews offer a powerful nudge toward a macro conversion.

<strong>Short explainer videos</strong>

Nothing converts like video – <a href=""https://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/top-7-strategies-convert-more-customers-using-video/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>52% of marketers</u></a> say it has the best ROI of any medium. Short, <u><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/video-production-company/motion-graphics-design-company/"">well-executed videos</a> </u>do a great job of explaining your product or service. Additionally, research shows that online shoppers are twice as likely to buy if they watch a product video. Work with a video production company to focus on live streaming, video reviews, and influencer’s videos to help you increase conversions.

<strong>The value of tracking</strong>

Most micro-conversions don't lead to a macro-conversion (the average <u><a href=""https://www.smartinsights.com/ecommerce/ecommerce-analytics/ecommerce-conversion-rates/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">macro conversion rate</a> </u>is around 4%). Yet sales and other macro events aren't alone in providing value. Someone reading a blog post may not go on to make an immediate purchase, but that micro event raises brand awareness.

Micro-conversions also offer revealing, actionable data that brands can use to optimize their processes. One of the easiest ways to evaluate your micro conversions is through Google Analytics, which offers some <a href=""https://www.smartinsights.com/google-analytics/google-analytics-setup/event-tracking-codes-can-improve-micro-macro-conversions/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>fairly sophisticated tracking tools.</u></a> Event tracking codes are available for virtually every popular micro-conversion tactic.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Brands that make an effort to leverage and track micro-conversions will earn a significant competitive edge, as they gain deeper insight into the buyer's journey and can optimize their overall conversion framework.

Why replacing the last click model is imperative for all brands,"The last click attribution model isn't just <u><a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/fewer-than-10-of-us-marketers-think-their-company-s-attribution-knowledge-is-excellent"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">antiquated in today's advertising and marketing world</a> </u>-- it's been outmoded for years. In order to remain competitive, brands that have not kept pace should consider partnering with an advanced attribution modeling company.

Let's take a closer look at why the last click model is lacking, and how businesses can develop newer and more effective approaches.

<strong>Turning the page on last click</strong>

Conversions, generally, come after a series of touch points between the consumer and the individual elements within the marketing funnel. Given this multitude of touch points (and lacking access to each consumer's thinking process), assigning credit for conversions has historically been a challenging task.

The last click model offers a simple -- but highly inadequate -- solution to this problem: The last click or ad event gets all the credit. Of course, in many cases the last click or ad event may have been entirely irrelevant. In fact, it may have even been a net negative in the conversion process, giving the consumer a moment of doubt before converting. Nevertheless, under this model, it earns full credit to the exclusion of all other touch points.

Despite these profound limitations, last click remains widely used. According to data from eMarketer, 87% of companies with more than 100 workers and at least one digital advertising channel will use attribution modeling. Yet only 58.3% of these companies will use multichannel modeling, which assigns credit to multiple touch points.

So why are so many organizations sticking with a process that provides such limited visibility into the efficacy of a campaign? There are a few reasons. First, implementing new, more sophisticated models is a challenge, while last click is simple. Organizational inertia -- and the fear of integrating more complicated approaches -- helps keep last click in play.

Observers also point out that data is often siloed, and marketers aren't incentivized to share information across an organization. Additionally, many in the C-suite haven't taken steps to push marketers away from last click modeling, either due to a lack of understanding or by simply viewing it as a low priority.

<strong>A better solution</strong>

As eMarketer points out, there has long been skepticism among C-suite executives about certain aspects of digital marketing. Namely, concern about marketers using vanity metrics that make them look good and a lack of a clear link to concrete outcomes.

Dumping last click in favor of a more sophisticated modeling approach can play an instrumental part in diminishing such concerns. With a more fine-tuned modeling methodology linked to core outcomes, brands can gain much deeper visibility into the efficacy of their efforts, determining causality rather than correlation.

By working with a top <u><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/"">digital marketing agency</a> </u>or <u><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-analytics-services/"">attribution modeling company,</a> </u>businesses can implement alternative approaches. Some of the most common of these include:
<ul>
 	<li>Linear models (which assign credit equally)</li>
 	<li>Time decay models (where more credit is given closer to the conversion)</li>
 	<li>Position-based models (where the first and last touch points earn the largest credit)</li>
 	<li>Data-driven models (which harness machine learning technology to assign credit and can learn over time).</li>
</ul>

"Momo was a hoax, making a bigger challenge for today's brands","Momo -- an exceptionally creepy Japanese sculpture -- was likely responsible for thousands of terrified PTA meetings over the last few weeks. Yet brands have reason to worry as well. While Momo may not have been all she was cracked up to be, the viral sensation is indicative of a larger problem confronting social media platforms and brands -- one that a good media planning agency can help address.

Let's take a closer look at the hysteria behind the Momo Challenge, and what businesses need to know about the content issues plaguing today's platforms.

<strong>The truth about </strong><strong>Momo</strong><strong> mania</strong>

Momo is the frightening but harmless creation of Japanese special effects artist Keisuke Aisawa. Momo gained a second life on the Internet, however, after someone posted a photo of the fright-faced sculpture on Instagram.

This sculpture's creepy aesthetic encouraged the creation of a hoax called ""The Momo Challenge,"" wherein children viewing the sculpture online were (allegedly) encouraged to harm themselves or others, either via embedded messages or a link to a phone number. The concept piggybacked on the idea of a social media challenge, an online format that has grown wildly popular in recent years.

The only problem? None of it was actually real. But that didn't stop school administrators and sheriff's departments around the globe from issuing the standard warning fact sheets. In the end, thanks to media coverage and authority figure overreaction, parents everywhere began worrying about their children being exposed to the Momo Challenge while watching the latest episode of ""Peppa Pig"" on YouTube.

YouTube and Instagram received significant criticism for enabling Momo Mania. In response to the blowback, YouTube released a statement saying ""contrary to press reports, we’ve not received any recent evidence of videos showing or promoting the Momo Challenge on YouTube. The content of this kind would be in violation of our policies and removed immediately.”

So YouTube was the victim of a global hoax and overzealous news reporting? Not so fast. While the Momo Challenge might be strictly fantasy, plenty of other objectionable content has been delivered to unsuspecting children via YouTube.

One example: YouTube <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/youtube-kids-children-videos-age-restriction-peppa-pig-a8824261.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hosted a doctored version</a> of a real episode of the popular children's show ""Peppa Pig."" Nine seconds into the video, Peppa Pig's mother yells ""smoke weed!"" Things get worse from there, with the beloved children's show characters engaging in homophobic and racial slurs and rampant drug use.

The doctored video, which had no age restriction, was viewed 1.5 million times, with a large number of those views undoubtedly originating from unsuspecting kids. It's also just one example of a pervasive problem on the platform, which uses algorithms to suggest videos to viewers, and has no reliable mechanism to weed out objectionable content.

YouTube made an effort to wall off this sort of content by creating YouTube Kids, an app that contains only child-approved videos. However, YouTube Kids remains vastly less popular with children than the original platform. And, perhaps even more worrisome, it has also proven to be <a href=""https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-for-kids-videos-problems-algorithm-recommend"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">just as vulnerable</a> to the uploading of inappropriate content masquerading as children's fare.

This isn't just a problem for YouTube and other platforms–brands need to pay close attention as well.

<strong>How a media planning agency can protect your brand's reputation</strong>

Posting content on YouTube, Instagram, etc. is an essential part of brand building and messaging for most businesses. However, it's also easy for brands to become tainted by association if something objectionable occurs.

One example: A YouTube viewer could post offensive content within a comment under a brand's video, or splice that content directly into a brand's video. The right media planning agency can help ensure that any damage is mitigated immediately while offering <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/crisis-communication-company/"">crisis management services</a> and <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/public-media-relations/media-press-release-services/"">media outreach</a> should the incident prove damaging.

Media planning agencies can also assist with commercial placement, helping identify the right ad partners and ad placement within distributed content. This helps maximize both awareness and ROI -- while ensuring that advertisers reflect the values of the businesses they're partnered with.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Want to maximize your influencer relationships? Then go long,"Brand messaging services have long evangelized about the power of influencer marketing. Yet in order to maximize the returns brands see on influencer campaigns, it's important to optimize these relationships.

One key factor that many brands overlook in this process is longevity. By finding the right influencer partners and developing a sustained relationship, brands can build more interesting and complex content -- and ultimately save money doing it.

<strong>Unlocking the key to longevity</strong>

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/influencer-marketing/"">Influencer marketing</a> campaigns have evolved over time. A few years ago it was common for influencers and brands to partner for a single campaign and then move on.

Today, however, the trend is shifting toward <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/a-long-lasting-relationship-between-brands-and-influencers-radiates-authenticity/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">sustained collaboration</a>, and there are several reasons for this change.

First, brands are beginning to understand that sourcing influencers can be time-consuming. Today, the number of would-be influencers has grown significantly, so it takes more time to discern the pretenders from those with real market sway.

Brands also understand that longer relationships with influencers unlock greater creative potential. Once you grasp an influencer's strengths, abilities, and the preferences of the influencer's audience, you can use this information to develop highly targeted marketing content that's more relevant and more engaging. There's no feeling out process, which means less time and money is wasted trying to get creative sensibilities in alignment.

Long-term relationships also play well with audiences. If an influencer's audience sees that a featured brand is one half of a supportive, long-term partnership, this will register as authentic, and earn brands goodwill.

Influencers, too, benefit from a sustained partnership. High-level product partnerships help establish influencers as credible and increase their standing in the eyes of their followers, brands, and other influencers competing for the same market.

<strong>Setting the table for longevity</strong>

So how do brands lay the groundwork for long and mutually profitable relationships with influencers? It starts with identifying the right people. Success as an influencer isn't only about reach or pure numbers -- it's also about engagement. An influencer with 10,000 deeply passionate fans or followers may have more value than an influencer with 100,000 mildly-engaged fans or followers.

It's also critical to target the appropriate niche. This doesn't necessarily mean that a partner influencer needs to be situated in the exact same space as a brand's products or brand messaging services. There may be crossover opportunities with influencers in adjacent niches. Or, established influencers may seek to grow their followings into new yet still somewhat related categories -- a beauty blogger transitioning into fashion, for example.

Brands should carefully weigh variables such as the size of an audience, its growth rate, overall engagement, how long an influencer has been operating, the platforms they use, the kind of content they create and the values they possess.

It's also important to consider personal attributes as well. Influencers are like anyone else -- their interests, desires, ambitions, and life circumstances evolve over time. It's possible that today's fashion influencer may become tomorrow's parenting vlogger.

If all of these elements are aligned with the strategic needs of the brand, the stage is set for a long -- and mutually beneficial -- relationship.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

We understand the immense value that can be unleashed by establishing the right <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-strategy-firm/"">influencer marketing partnership</a>. Brands can work with influencers to create more authentic connections with their audiences through brand messaging services and reach highly motivated consumers within new lucrative channels.

Want your next marketing campaign to be great? Demand originality,"The phrase ""there's nothing new under the sun"" is pretty old itself -- it's the source is the Book of Ecclesiastes. Yet that ancient proverb is still relevant today, as it's also the lament of just about every creative director and content editor. This sea of monotony does have one upside: Businesses that pursue <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-positioning-agency/"">creative brand consulting </a>to help generate original ideas will earn a significant competitive edge.

<strong>The value of originality</strong>

Our world is a derivative one. If you need proof, just look at Hollywood's endless procession of remakes and superhero franchises, the music industry's love of cover songs, and the advertising industry's tendency to copycat and mimic. Hey, it's easier to copy something that works rather than developing original material, right?

Sure, it's <em>easier </em>-- but it's also much less effective. The law of diminishing returns kicks in, as the third and fourth versions of a great new idea always have much less impact. Given that we're all surrounded by advertising, we've become inured to it in many ways. If brands want to <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">truly engage</a> an audience and snap them to attention, they need to be boldly original. They need creative brand consulting.

One great example of this is <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/creativity/farmers-insurance-took-actual-claims-and-reimagined-them-as-a-dr-seuss-story/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a recent ad campaign </a>from Farmer's Insurance. The insurance industry isn't particularly exciting, but companies within the sector have found some success by creating standout characters (the AFLAC duck, Flo from Progressive, etc.).

Farmer's has employed the Oscar-winning character actor J.K. Simmons to much the same effect recently. In a recent campaign, Farmer's created a 60-second ad based on ""Oh, the Places You Will Go"" by Dr. Seuss, with Simmons providing the narration.

The commercial had a special hook, however: Farmer's took actual claims from customers and reimagined them as Dr. Seuss stories, complete with whimsical rhyming narration. Farmer's and its ad agency partner RPA took added pains to ensure the end product adhered closely to Seussian style, both in terms of style and quality.

The result was deeply clever incorporation of the core business (insurance claims coverage) into a larger creative message that emphasized experience and exploration. To top things off, the ad was released on the 115th birthday of Dr. Seuss.

<strong>Why originality is the ultimate differentiator</strong>

The next time you're consuming content, take some time to really watch the ads and marketing message you're being served. You'll find that a handful of them are fantastic -- and the majority are utterly forgettable.

Forgettable is one of the worst things you can say about an advertisement. So why do so many brands settle for mediocrity? Part of it can be ascribed to the agencies with which they're partnering. It's not easy generating original ideas, and generating these ideas to work within the specific context on an ad campaign is even more difficult. This means agencies have an incentive to settle for ""OK"" when they should be aiming much higher.

It's the responsibility of businesses to demand original and highly engaging ideas. While this work isn't easy, the right creative brand consulting firm can deliver the kind of deeply original advertising and marketing content that audiences find impossible to ignore.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

At BIGEYE, we understand the value of originality -- and we have the resources and talent to take advantage of it. We specialize in creating advertising and marketing campaigns that engage audiences and deliver maximum ROI for brands.

Marketing that connects with younger audiences in three letters,"Here's one rule about online communication: Over time, it will always trend toward the simplest and least work-intensive mode possible. That's why reaction GIFs have supplanted witty one-liners as the Internet's retort of choice. For brands seeking to update their marketing efforts with a fresher look (perhaps by hiring a motion graphics design company) it also represents a big opportunity.

<strong>Why GIFs and motion graphics connect with today's audiences</strong>

Just in case you've been on a multi-year social media detox, let's take a moment to explain how GIFs work. If you've ever been on Twitter or another social media platform and witnessed someone reply to a questionable comment with a looping video clip of someone else doing an astonished double-take, you've seen a reaction GIF in action.

GIFs (short for Graphics Interchange Format) have become a dominant mode of expression in social media settings, text applications, and other mediums. The reason is simple: With virtually no effort, you can express a complex (and often quite amusing) message.

In a development that should surprise exactly no one, younger people are especially fond of GIFs. In a Time magazine survey, a full <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/327112"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">two-thirds of millennials </a>claimed that GIFs represent their feelings and thoughts better than written communication.

While that is undoubtedly a major blow for idealistic English teachers across the globe, it's also an opportunity for savvy marketers.

Let's face it: Marketers have been told ad nauseam that appealing to millennials and Generation Z is imperative. And that's true -- there's no arguing with demographics. Yet despite this urgent task, brands haven't always covered themselves in glory when it comes to targeting millennials. Even an otherwise sharp outfit like Google stumbled while negotiating this tricky terrain.

The search giant created a report advising other businesses on appealing to millennials. This report, hilariously titled ""It's Lit,"" featured a design that made it look like an <a href=""https://mashable.com/2017/04/03/google-its-lit-young-people-cool-report/#4LeGTpUQeaqG"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">especially flashy Macy's catalog</a>. Inside things were even direr -- Google's Millennial Research Team maintained that Gen Z members think that Chick-fil-A is the world's ""coolest brand"" -- ranking higher than famously ultra-cool brands like Vice and Supreme. Much media derision, of course, ensued.

So how can a business with fewer resources than Google negotiate this millennial minefield?

Through partnering with a motion graphic design company. And GIFs, of course.

<strong>Integrating GIFs into your marketing</strong>

GIFs have value because they allow brands to transmit their messages in what is essentially the lingua franca of the youth Internet. Brands that can deploy GIFs in a clever manner will seem more relatable.

GIFs have the benefit of being simple to use and hard to misuse. Younger audiences may scorn a business using ""It's lit"" non-ironically, but they won't think twice about a clever GIF deployed via <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-advertising-services-retargeting/"">social media marketing.</a>

Young people aren't the only market to target, of course, GIFs can be used to entice customers within marketing messages. Blue Apron uses GIFs in its email marketing campaigns to show consumers the delicious meals they could be making. GIFs can be used in digital ads or integrated into blog posts as instructional elements. They have far more utility than simply being deployed as a witty rejoinder in a social media conversation.

Working with a motion graphics design company can help brands optimize their GIF strategy. The <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">right company</a> can help a brand derive maximum value from a small -- but powerful -- visual message.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

"Opt out of the marketing arms race, win the war for buyer loyalty","Are you marketing to consumers -- or to your fellow marketers? It might seem like an obvious question, at least superficially. Yet if you look deeper into how your <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/""><u>multi-channel marketing services </u></a>are designed and executed, and how your agency chooses to operate, you might find that the answer isn't as cut-and-dried as you think.

<strong>Avoiding marketing groupthink</strong>

The marketing industry tends to be highly trend-driven. If an agency implements a new solution or develops a fresh approach, its competitors often feel the need to follow this lead. The idea of being left behind, or being perceived as behind the knowledge curve, is enough to compel them into action.

Yet as a <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/agencies/consumers-have-stated-their-needs-its-time-for-marketers-to-actually-listen/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>recent column in AdWeek </u></a>points out, this behavior often becomes a self-reinforcing cycle, with agencies chasing fads and trends in an ever-escalating arms race. They become so concerned about the competition that they lose sight of who truly matters: buyers.

As AdWeek points out, the birth of the Internet and the proliferation of multi-channel marketing services created incredible new opportunities for marketers. Consumers, for the first time, could research a vast array of projects on a mass scale, creating a new buyer category: inbound prospects.

CRM platforms were soon developed, ultimately becoming an essential operational cornerstone. Now, consumers could be categorized, tracked and guided down the sales funnel with precision, and data could be gathered to measure the efficacy of various techniques and tactics.

While the emergence of this new technology offered wonderful opportunities, it also had unintended side effects. Communication between brands and buyers became mediated by multi-channel marketing technology.

In many cases, this went too far. Marketers attempted to over-digitize the buyer's journey instead of integrating human interaction within technology. Marketers also began to place too much faith in metrics that offered too little visibility into what consumers were really feeling, and what their true intentions were.

Agencies began relying too heavily on these metrics to measure performance, leading to an epidemic of vanity metrics that say more about an agency's need for self-justification rather than its true real-world impact.

Instead of personalized and targeted marketing infused with human interactions, buyers were given a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn't serve their interests.

<strong>Finding a better path</strong>

So how do marketers opt out of the arms race and refocus on what really matters? Step one would be to join forces with a multi-channel marketing services agency. From there, AdWeek suggests de-emphasizing industry data benchmarks in favor of deeper intelligence gathering on buyers. The idea is simple: Develop more actionable insight into the people who are buying your products and services today, and use this information to refine your approach.

<strong>Do the following. It’s important.</strong>

1.Realize that the sales funnel is not a perfect concept. If your approach is too inflexible, it's likely suboptimal. Don't treat buyers like they are all the same.

2. Ensure you're marketing to buyers, not other marketers. Having another marketing agency think your idea is clever will be small consolation if it doesn't resonate with buyers.

3. Don't allow automation to quash authenticity. Yes, automation has many benefits. Yet it shouldn't be allowed to de-emphasize human interactions.

4. Listen to what buyers are asking for and offer them customized solutions.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

At BIGEYE, we're firm believers in the power of technology. Yet we'll never follow empty trends or allow software to replace the human element. In order to provide truly great marketing, the digital and the personal need to be integrated through well strategized multi-channel marketing services.

What a creative advertising agency can learn from Geico,"Everyone knows Geico Insurance. Whether you’re a fan of the gecko, caveman, or another one of their mascots, we’ve all got to hand it to Geico for their incredibly well-done ads. We fully recognize it’s no accident either, they consistently make brilliant, strategic decisions ultimately getting them to where they are today.

Our curiosity peaks when we ask the question: What drives those ever-changing concepts? Here’s what we’ve learned.

<strong>1</strong>. <strong>Don’t let the product be the only focus</strong>

Let’s be real, insurance is not the most engaging subject. Consumers don’t pay attention to ads centered on jargon and driven by industry best practices; they want to be entertained. Geico’s creative advertising agency does an amazing job of having fun with their product with a purpose. For example, the caveman ads. A campaign that revolved around the concept that cavemen exist today and the slogan, “so easy a caveman could do it” deeply offends them.

This has absolutely nothing to do with insurance, any industry has a convenient pull and this could have resonated in any of them. It’s simply that Geico coined it. You can see this idea in most of their ads. However, the product isn’t just tacked on either. It’s a big plot point. Who is saying their product is, “so easy a caveman could do it?” Geico.

They are central to the plot but not the only focus. Your <a href=""https://digitalmarketingdawgs.com/2018/09/18/geicos-marketing-strategy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">campaign strategy </a>should do the same thing. Get a creative ad agency with <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">strategies </a>that will weave your brand into the content in interesting, innovative ways.

<strong>2. Put in the resources</strong>

Amazing ads can’t be crafted in 2 hours on $10. Giving your creative ad agency the time and resources they need to truly capture your voice and vision is a huge step towards long-term campaign success. <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandindex/2017/11/27/geico-and-progressive-see-positive-gains-in-consumer-sentiment/#3acafbbe63a1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">According to Forbes</a>, Geico invested $5 million in ad creation for 2017 alone. That’s an astronomical number, but for the breadth of ads, quality content, varied target markets the results show it all. That year, Geico’s brand awareness hit 53%. For context, Progressive’s high-point that year was 43%.

Now it’s not all about spending, Progressive had spent $4.5 million and got significantly lower results. The talent must also be there, as well as avid and clear communication on vision and goals. Look at the top creative agencies in your industry, target markets, and locations before you decide which creative advertising agency should get that big investment. Money can only take you so far, you need the <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/"">right people</a>.

<strong>3</strong>. <strong>Don’t keep repeating the same ad</strong>

Even the most energizing and unique concepts can get monotonous and bothersome over time. Don’t make your audience watch the same thing over and over. Whether it’s through one concept with multiple executions or multiple different campaigns running at once, give your audience varied the content. Geico is a great example of both practices. Their creative advertising agency ran many spots featuring their acoustic musicians in ads such as Hump Day and Christopher Columbus. Then ran separate campaigns at the same time by keeping their Gecko ads running while ads featuring fun facts in realistic situations were also on air.

More than varied content, you need to also use <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-agency/"">multiple channels</a>. Geico ads can be found in print, on TV, and YouTube Pre-roll too. Get a creative digital agency that works across platforms. This way, your content will be seen and won’t get stale.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Memorable advertising is a complex order, and every brand is different. You can achieve high brand awareness and drive profits with a few key concepts. So, what are the takeaways? Have more than one ad, keeping your consumers engaged demands innovative, plentiful content. Let the story drive the ad, your brand should be a key plot driver but not the only focus. Tell a complete narrative that lets your products shine without being the only concept at hand. Finally, give your agency the time, information, and funding they need to reach your goals effectively.

Huge changes ahead for Google ads agencies and why you should care,"So, what is first-price auction, and how is it different from second-price auction? The answer is simple: payout. The second-price auction is the system Google has been using. This way, the bidder only pays a small increment above the second highest bid. For example, if Bid “A” is $75 K and Bid “B” is $20 K, then the winner behind Bid “A” pays something along the lines of $20,001. Under the new system, first-price auction, the winner behind Bid “A” would pay the $75 K offered.

The first-price system also eliminates <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/online-advertising/google-switches-to-first-price-auction/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">“last look.”</a>A program that gave advertisers more access to Google’s offerings. It allowed for a Google ads agency to add a penny and outbid the winner, raising Google’s AdWords and DSP win rates while opening up exclusive offers for the buyer.

Second-price auctions have been the name of the game at every Google ads agency for years, so most demand-side platforms are built around it. Many advertisers will be at a disadvantage of negotiating in this new system. More than that, with a service as prominent as Google leading the charge, many PPC, or pay-per-click, providers will be making this same change.

Buyers won’t be the only ones floored by this change. Publishers will be at a disadvantage as well. They will need to restructure their price flooring strategies in order to keep sales within a profitable range. Changes like this call for adjustments throughout the industry.

<strong>How it will change</strong>

The rollout will be incremental, starting at a small percentage of the traffic and expanding with Google ads updates until first price auctions are all that Google deals in. The switch should cover the entire Google Ad Manager system by the end of the year. It will be a swift change and every <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">digital media buying agency </a>will need to pivot quickly to avoid wasting client funds.

Since Google is an industry leader, this change could kick-off a widespread shift across platforms. Each TV advertising agency, digital media buyer, and traditional media strategist will need to learn how to effectively manage first-price auctions. Any <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/pay-per-click-marketing-firm/"">PPC management </a>you seek out should be experienced in or exceedingly familiar with the processes that first-price auctions call for.

According to <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/google-ad-manager-to-offer-first-price-auctions-simplifying-programmatic-buying/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sam Cox</a>, the group product manager at Google Ad Manager, this change in selling styles will only be applied to services bought through the Ad Manager system. At least for now, the Google properties like AdSense for Search, Search itself, and YouTube won’t be changing.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Google is moving its Ad Manager property from a second-price auction to a first-price auction system. They are starting small, but by the end of the year, all placements bought through Google Ad Manager will be done through the first-price auction. This means you’ll need to find a Google ads agency with a deep understanding of the new system. Get in touch with media buyers that adapt and change quickly, or budget for some growing pains.

As an experienced Google ads agency, we understand the first-price auction system well. We are primed to pivot as quickly as process changes like these occur without missing a beat or wasting client money.

3 reasons you should be using direct to consumer advertising,"There’s a lot more to direct to consumer advertising than most realize, agencies and clients alike don’t always understand its scope. DTC, or D2C, stands for direct to consumer and refers to any communication that goes from a brand to the user or buyer specifically. A one-to-one communication with no middleman. Which sounds pretty simple but covers quite a bit, including direct mailers, social media, brand and voice apps, native advertising, and plenty more.

Here are 3 of the top reasons you should be utilizing DTC:

<strong>1. Control the perceptions of your brand</strong>

Brands are only as strong as their storytelling. When consumers don’t know, believe, or understand your narrative they make up their own. Leveraging the power of direct to consumer marketing, your brand can take full <a href=""https://digiday.com/retail/focus-footprint-dtc-brands-pumping-brakes-wholesale-partnerships/"">control of your narrative </a>telling your consumers your story directly to get them engaged, listening, and interacting. The more you can inspire your target market to get involved with your brand, the more invested they’ll be in your services. It’s not really your company's products or services that keep consumers coming back, it’s <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/"">strong branding </a>and spellbinding storytelling that turns customers into true brand advocates.

While direct to consumer strategy is all about direct communication, it’s important to know what you want to say and how best to say it. There are tons of channels for DTC and choosing the ones that will draw in the correct audience is just as integral as the communication itself. Get in touch with <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">strategy and content experts </a>before deciding on any specific execution. As these words will come directly from your brand they will be seen as an honest representation of your company, so they need to reliably strike the right cord.

<strong>2. Cut costs while growing your consumer base</strong>

The efficiency that comes with DTC strategies stems from the funds you keep by cutting down on middlemen. While cutting costs is a great goal, DTC would still be a waste of resources if it’s not effective. The impact of your D2C marketing, another term for direct to consumer advertising concepts, will be determined by the quality of the content and channel. For instance, if your brand is communicating through an app then the user experience needs to be just as strong as the content. The program is representing you and the consumer learn more from experience than from content.

Build out your D2C marketing strategy with an advertising agency that understands the intricacies of <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">app development and marketing </a>to reach your goals without wasting time or resources. Streamlining your communications is only useful when those communications are what your consumers want to hear served in a way that will make them listen.

<strong>3. Instantly update your narrative as trends shift</strong>

Having direct control over your band’s communications gives you unique speed when it’s time to make a change. Consumers and cultures are ever-changing so your content needs to be as well. When looking at native advertising DTC channels such as social media, you can <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/infographic-what-shoppers-actually-think-about-the-hottest-direct-to-consumer-trends/"">shift the perceptions </a>of your entire audience over just a few weeks utilizing crafted strategic posts. When your communications are controlled by you, shifts and swerves are well within reach; so is direct interaction.

Through strategic interactions with your consumers, you can learn about them as much as they’ll learn about your brand. As your communicators begin to genuinely understand the target market, they’ll be able to tweak your approach better and connect more effectively. For all this to work you’ll need skilled communicators in charge of your DTC communications, to monitor and adjust messaging in real-time.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Direct to consumer advertising has a great deal to offer brands that effectively use it. Leveraging effective strategy, well-executed content, and a deep understanding of their audience, direct to consumer brands can drive incredible profits and build loyalty.

Correctly managing all the variables at hand takes a lot of strategic skill and industry understanding. Being a full-service agency with a strategic center that deeply understands audiences and how to best position brands to appeal to them.

5 things consumers are looking for in banking services,"Finance is not boring. Complex maybe, but useful and all-encompassing. To get through to your consumers in this saturated market there’s a lot that banks can do to stand out. Some are merging and others offer incentives, but how much does a one-time deal or big banking matter to customers?

As a financial services marketing agency, we’ve narrowed down the 5 things today’s consumers look for in a bank, so let’s dive in.

<strong>1. Security</strong>

So, this one’s pretty obvious. Everyone wants their money to be safe. But as technology evolves, so does the definition of secure. It’s no longer enough to have a big impressive vault—you need big impressive coding, too.

In a recent study by <a href=""https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-week/consumer-banking-trends-2019/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">the Global Web Index</a>, it was found that 34% of millennials and 36% of gen X believe that biometrics make transactions more secure. Coincidentally, you should be marketing to millennials for financial services as they are the generation that is most likely to switch banks within the next year.

These details matter, and when it comes to the marketing of financial services, adding something simple like a fingerprint scanner can make all the difference.

<strong>2. Clarity</strong>

It should come as no big shock to you that consumers today put a high premium on transparency. But that’s not all that today’s adults want. Your customers aren’t looking for you to just be open—they want you to be clear, understandable. <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/copywriting-services/"">Cut the jargon </a>out of your communications while providing the educational tools for your customers to learn those terms anyway.

Explain to them what they should do, then give them the tools to come to that same conclusion themselves. The more your financial marketing company can add value to your services with things like financial advice, online financial glossaries, and even courses and webinars, the more your consumers will value your services. Providing substantive tools and insightful advice in clear, easily digestible segments will set your bank apart.

Teaching your consumers how to figure it out themselves next time does even more. Learning tools build trust, keeping your customers happy while enticing some new ones to come on in and see what all the fuss is about.

<strong>3. Technology</strong>

You may think we’re just telling you that your consumers like new, shiny things, but there’s a lot more to it than that. Today’s consumers expect instant gratification and thrive on the power to make every change at their fingertips. Give your consumers intuitive apps, online tools, and easy-to-understand interfaces that deliver what they want—convenience. It may seem counterintuitive, but the less your consumers have to see you, the more they’ll like you.

Your financial services marketing agency should know that everything in today’s world is instant, digital, and busy. Your customers don’t want to have to walk in or find an ATM to get to their funds—they want it available whenever and wherever they are. Your customers already work hard to earn their money, don’t make them work harder to use it.

<strong>4. Future planning</strong>

Here’s where things get a bit deeper. A lot of millennials and gen X have never taken courses in budgeting or balancing a checkbook. Making your services easy to use only gets them halfway there. They want to budget for their future, to save up for personal goals and your app should help them get there.

There are a <a href=""https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/budgeting-saving-tools/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">handful of apps </a>available that help consumers plan and take charge of their budget, but there is a unique opportunity in offering this service as their bank. You already have their trust and the expertise they are looking for. Building on that, by providing budgeting tools you add value to your services, building brand loyalty and increasing customer satisfaction.

<strong>5. Integration</strong>

Here’s where it all comes together. Now that you’ve got all those tools, biometric locks, financial learning, cutting edge technology, and budgeting capabilities, your consumers will want to be able to use it all together. Paying for the things they want through your secure servers with their biometric approval right from the app. Receiving notifications on budget categories that are nearing their spending caps. Gaining virtual gold stars or actual awards for reaching goals set through earning and planning features within the app.

By adding all these assets to your services, and letting them meld and <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/mobile-app-marketing-agency/"">cross-reference seamlessly </a>you show your consumers what you can do for them. Combining your expertise with their daily lifestyle, you build relationships and loyalty that will pay for itself 10-fold.

When you boil it down, today’s consumers don’t care how big your bank is or how many ATMs you’ve got globally.

3 Things to unlearn about video game marketing for your brand,"There are a lot of things that people think they know about marketing to gamers. Forget all of it. The gaming world is a lot more like the mainstream world than most would think. There is a large amount of both men and women, as well as many different interests and categories. This can make for an incredibly diverse, yet niche audience. The complexity that comes with a melting pot like gaming is hard to fully grasp. So here are some common misconceptions you should unlearn.

<strong>1.Stereotypes</strong>

There are many ideas out there about the gamer demographic that are flat out wrong. Let’s go through a few and get to the truth of it.

There is one singular gamer demographic: As previously mentioned, there are currently <a href=""https://edelmandigital.com/dos-donts-marketing-gamers-esports-fans/#gref"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2.3 billion people </a>that make up the video gaming marketing audience. There is no one profile that can encompass many people. It’s important to understand that there are even more game genres as there are book genres. Books have sci-fi, fantasy, historical fiction, murder mystery and more. Games have role-playing, first-person shooters, platformers, scrollers, racing, puzzles, etc; then added on top of that are stories of all shapes and sizes that justify each action and these two levels are combined in every possible way in gaming.
<ul>
 	<li>Gamers are children: According to <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Statista </a> most gamers are 18-35 years old. In fact, 23% of gamers are 50 years of age and older. This isn’t to say that children do not play video games. They do. Here is the 2018 Statista gamer distribution:</li>
 	<li>Gamers are men: Almost half of the gamers in the US are women and the statistic seems to only be growing. Here is a gender distribution from Statista showing 2006-2018.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Gamers are secluded introverts: According to <a href=""https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/post/113388063887/i-spent-several-years-of-my-career-as-a-video-game"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Yahoo! Small Business</a>, gamers are intricately interwoven and over 60% play together both in-person and digitally. With live chats, streamers, game commentators, the ever-growing world of esports, and plain old multiplayer games the idea of the loner gamer has passed its expiration date.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Games are played on consoles: Consoles are gaming devices that either plug-into TVs or are their own handheld device. However, there is also PC gaming which is done online through PC computers, as well as mobile gaming which are just as popular—in fact, they’re more popular. Check out this gaming platform distribution for 2019 from <a href=""https://www.statista.com/chart/4527/game-developers-platform-preferences/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Statista</a>.</li>
</ul>
Plus, most gamers play on any and every platform they can get their hands on.

<strong>2. Chameleon-ing </strong>

When getting into video game marketing, you have to be genuine. While brands need to be genuine to achieve their goals in all areas, in gaming it works a little differently. <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/09/25/gamers-can-smell-bullshit-mile-how-brands-can-legitimately-get-gaming"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Andy Fairclough and Rhian Mason </a>of The Drum said it best, “Gamers can smell bullshit a mile off” don’t just try to tack on a gaming audience. Gamers are used to interactive, engaging media on a level that can’t even be matched by social users. You have to earn their attention genuinely—and here’s the catch—that’s genuine to who you are rather than who you think consumers will listen to.

If there’s one thing Gamers value it’s being absolutely yourself, whoever that is, whether or not you think that’s who they want you to be. If you have an established brand you should stay true to it when marketing to gamers. They do their research; they’ll see right through pandering and they like to talk. The moment your voice is “debunked” by a gamer it will be all over every forum, your campaign will be dead in the water. Do not change who you are to appeal to gamers, use the same message—your message—in a different way on the right channel. <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/content-marketing-agency/"">How and where </a>is integral as well. Unless your product is a game do not base your campaign on game marketing. Gamers don’t like being tricked or yanked on. They’ll hate this tactic just as much as personality falsities.

<strong>3. One-sided advertising</strong>

Be in the conversation, not just near it. Gamers are all about interactive media, speaking at them rather than with them is a huge oversight. When entering the conversation, remember the advice above, be genuine. If you’re not sure your branding is the right fit, then <a href=""https://edelmandigital.com/dos-donts-marketing-gamers-esports-fans/#gref"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">influencers </a>can make all the difference. Gamers love live streamers on YouTube and Twitch or the expert teams leading the esports charts. Find the type of gamers you are looking to reach out to then reach out to their influencers. If you want your video game marketing communications to be more direct there’s Reddit where you can find existing game threads and join them as well as gaming platforms with plenty of opportunities to interact with gamers such as mobile game apps and Steam for PC players.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

If you’re looking to market your products or services to gamers, find advertising experts that understand video game marketing, that know the stereotypes are outdated, falsities will get you nowhere, and that all brand communications should be customized, grassroots, interacted, or a combination thereof. The gaming world is multi-faceted and takes a lot of research and expertise to excel in.

Top five things to consider when advertising on Hulu,"An over-the-top advertising or OTT advertising tool allows brands to advertise on apps and streaming services. When looking at Hulu’s advertising technology, many opportunities become clear. From T-commerce which allows viewers to purchase directly from the ad to interactive interstitial that shows your commercial then enables viewers to explore more content within the ad itself. As an experienced OTT advertising agency, we decided to dive in and get to know Hulu ourselves.

Some tips to keep in mind when deciding how to advertise on Hulu:

<strong>1. Not everything needs to be interactive</strong>

Hulu has a lot of interactive options that are meant to get viewers clicking for more. Take a look at the <a href=""https://www.hulu.com/advertising/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">full list</a>. While these are valid and exciting offers, it’s important to consider how your chosen media can enhance your product rather than how trendy that media’s capabilities are. If you have a product that requires high-involvement purchasing like a car or a home, being able to dig into the details to see more and learn more makes a lot of sense. If your product calls for a shorter consumer journey, a classic ad, Hulu’s slate advertising, or custom integrated commercials could be a better approach.

It’s important to note that we’re not saying that those interactive options aren’t valid. They can be entertaining and engaging. Allowing your consumers to choose which version of your ad they’ll watch can make them feel like they have some control. But if the audience doesn’t particularly care, then those extra seconds of ad selection can come off as more bothersome than empowering. It all comes down to knowing your brand and your message while deeply understanding what motivates your target market.

<strong>2. Leverage context targeting, get specific</strong>

When it comes to streaming media, you can get incredibly detailed with your targeting. Determining the type of shows your consumers watch can seem pretty simple. But with so many options on how to advertise on Hulu, you need an in-depth understanding of what motivates your target market to predict what they’ll respond to. Will they care enough to find the controller and click for more? Are they watching on TV through a device? On the computer? On the phone? Some of Hulu’s advertising types work only through a browser. Some are only seen by those who are browsing around. So if your target market is full of planners who only open Hulu when they’ve got their show in mind, they won’t see it. You need to get specific about your targeting; it has to go deeper than a tendency to stream media. How does your audience stream? When? Where? On what? These details matter. How each of Hulu’s options applies to different contexts that <a href=""https://ignitevisibility.com/advertising-on-hulu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">can be found</a>.

If you pinpoint what motivates your consumers to listen, you can leverage the unique capabilities of Hulu advertising to drive real results. For example, if news about a specific show on Hulu coming back will attain consumer attention more effectively than your current campaign, then your OTT advertising agency should consider the custom integrated commercials option on Hulu. These take main actors or environments from popular shows and put your product into the mix to explore interesting applications of your features while driving consumer interest. Learn more about in-depth, <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">strategic targeting</a>.

<strong>3. High-tech ads have their place and time, so choose traditional options</strong>

As an OTT advertising agency, anything and everything ‘cutting-edge’ can feel exciting and enticing, but it’s not about the amount of fun you have creating or placing the ads—it’s about their effectiveness. Hulu advertising doesn’t center around the video or even experiential advertising. It has to center on your consumers and what appeals to them while they’re streaming. Effectively promoting your products can be as simple and classic as product placement. With Hulu’s masthead product placement your market will come across your brand right next to Hulu’s recommended popular show while they browse for the next series to watch. A page brand placement is also a possible solution, but it will only be seen by those scrolling through streaming options from a browser.

<strong>4. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket</strong>

Your campaign should vary, once you’ve correctly targeted your consumers you don’t want your message to get too repetitive or boring. Your OTT advertising agency should vary your ad buys between the multitude of options Hulu provides to keep your consumers engaged rather than tuning out. A good example would be a mix of ad selectors allowing your consumers to choose between 2 or 3 different video ads then supporting it with masthead product placement to retarget your market on another day. Raising interest in a way that isn’t monotonous or annoying. Another good mix could be a custom integrated commercial to get your consumers listening and seeing your features in an engaging way, then following it up with a T-commerce placement where they can see one of your campaign commercials then make a direct purchase. Learn about our <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/marketing-planning-communications-agency/"">strategic marketing</a>.

Whatever mix you end up going with, promoting your products in various innovative ways will keep your target market engaged with your brand, keep your product top-of-mind, and reliably drive brand recognition. No campaign should feature just one ad. Once your branding is targeted as specifically as Hulu allows, a single-note campaign will become repetitive and monotonous. Varying the media type, especially on the same platform, will keep your message fresh and engaging.

<strong>5. Approach with a strategy in mind</strong>

There is a lot an experienced OTT advertising agency can do with advertising on Hulu. However, with the multitude of options and varied audiences, you need to approach Hulu advertising with clear goals and tactics in mind. Otherwise, your message can get buried in the noise of the platform itself. Get an expert team that will do the research, build the strategy, and crafts the creative needed to design an impactful campaign that will get your consumers talking. The goal is to end up with one contiguous campaign that seamlessly delivers your brand’s message in an engaging way to drive conversions. Equipped with a deep understanding of your audience, effective communications, and Hulu’s capabilities your campaign has the potential to drive incredible results.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Hulu can be a greatly effective platform for reaching and engaging your audience. But it is important for your OTT advertising agency to remember some key elements. Not everything needs to be interactive, cutting-edge technology can be really engaging but it needs to match your branding and products. Hulu shows attract specific audiences, know who will be seeing your message and position your communications accordingly. High-tech ads have their place and time, so do more traditional options, consider how each message will be communicated across executions. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, let your campaign vary to keep your consumers listening. Finally, approach with a strategy in mind, don’t get bogged down in the details. Have clear objectives and set tactics to reliably achieve your goals. <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">Contact our team</a> of media buyers and planners to assist you.",,4/18/2019 16:07,1,https://www.bigeyeagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-five-things-to-consider-when-advertising-on-Hulu.jpg,top-five-things-to-consider-when-advertising-on-hulu,publish,,Bottom,0,open,
3 things you should know about addressable TV advertising,"TV advertising isn’t as targeted as digital...or is it? According to <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/addressable-tv-advertising-personal-video-experience/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google Consumer Insights</a>, addressable TV advertising allows brands to show their ads to specific households, rather than targeting audiences by the program being shown. Addressable television is a great way to reach specific households across television services no matter the show they’re watching.

With Nielsen recently acquiring Sorensen Media, addressable TV is growing more and more powerful. <a href=""https://marketingland.com/addressable-tv-gets-a-boost-as-nielsen-buys-sorensen-media-257486?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed-main"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Marketing Land </a>says that this move will help Nielsen begin offering addressable TV along with in-depth measurement services. Well known for their detailed market research, Nielsen leads the pack when it comes to audience targeting and insights.

There are a lot of advantages that come with addressable TV advertising, so we decided to share a few.

<strong>1. Save money</strong>

Programmatic media buying is not a new concept by any means. But leveraging its power in combination with addressable tools means that a TV advertising agency can get their message to the target audience without spending your ad budget on anyone who happens to watch that specific show. This singular household targeting raises effectiveness while saving money on ad spend.

An experienced media strategy agency can effectively leverage traditional channels to reach your consumers where and when they’ll be listening. That’s the crux of it all, reaching the right people, in the right place, at the right time. Which takes a lot more than an effective channel or method, it requires <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/media-strategy-services/"">the right agency</a>.

<strong>2. Not service-specific</strong>

Addressable TV advertising isn’t the only way to reach specific consumers leveraging the draw of shows. There are many others, channels such as OTT advertising and mobile targeting, but many of those rely on one specific service provider. OTT allows advertisers to reach users on specific streaming services, while addressable TV is more akin to programmatic, traditional TV buying. Which simply means that OTT is more limited. For example, Hulu advertising is only for Hulu while Addressable TV reaches across any cable or satellite provider.

Understanding your audience is the key to selecting any channel and budget. By using an effective <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience segmentation consultant </a>you can define who you are looking for and what drives them.

<strong>3. Opportunity in precision</strong>

Addressable TV advertising brings a strategy of its own kind for reaching specific audiences. It's that specialized opportunity for detailed targeting that makes this tool so unique. Once you understand who you are looking to reach, addressable TV is an efficient mix of modern and traditional that optimizes your reach over any program. Many channels claim that, but the optimization here is in reaching the right people versus reaching the most. With addressable TV, you are paying only for your targeted households.

<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">Highly specific targeting </a>is no new concept to most expert agencies. As it is with all advertising, the right strategies can make or break your campaign. But with detailed targeting, it becomes even more important that the audience targeted is the correct one for your brand. Most other markets won’t be reached at all.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

When all is said and done, addressable TV lends itself well to effective advertising. It’s cost-effective, has a broad reach, and allows the opportunity for incredibly detailed targeting. Leveraged correctly, it can turn a good campaign into unparalleled success.

How to effectively optimize your credit union marketing,"Anyone looking to craft an effective credit union marketing plan first needs to understand the institutions themselves. So, let’s go over what sets <a href=""https://smartasset.com/checking-account/what-is-a-credit-union"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">credit unions </a>apart from banks. Every person with an account at a credit union is, in part, an owner. This helps to ensure that each decision and investment is made in the best interest of the customers and not some third-party stakeholder.

Leveraging the internal strengths of a credit union, your branding can empower consumers and employees alike. Ultimately turning them into brand advocates. Let’s take a look at some of the unique aspects that effective credit union marketing should emphasize.

<strong>1. People-focused</strong>

Credit unions are inherently user-focused, as explained. This creates a huge opportunity for creating strong consumer relationships. Humanize your credit union from the inside out by bringing current users together. Plan appreciation events or giveaways to give consumers something to bond over and tell others about. Credit union marketing is about making every participant happy. Loyalty comes from the <a href=""https://www.cuinsight.com/7-marketing-trends-for-credit-unions-in-2019.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">little things</a>.

<strong>2. Lead the charge</strong>

Everyone likes to be a part of something. As a credit union, you’re already part of a team, but you need to become the leader. <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">Start the conversation </a>on financing and credit score tips, saving money, or something newsworthy to inform and help out your target market as well as existing customers.

Get active in the <a href=""https://silvercloudinc.com/blog/8-unique-bank-and-credit-union-marketing-ideas/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">shared community</a>, current events, and social movements to get connected to your audience in the genuine, personal way that only credit unions can.

<strong>3. Show reinvestment</strong>

Credit unions are by the people, for the people. One person’s deposit becomes the next person’s loan, make that known. Your credit union marketing agency should make every part-owner understand the part they play in helping each other. This will build loyalty and a feeling of being part of something bigger. This mentality is a huge draw for Millennial, Gen Z, and Gen X audiences. It can also turn current members into strong brand advocates.

With the more friendly and casual nature of a credit union, you already have a great foundation for building strong consumer relationships. The lack of stakeholders provides a unique opportunity for personalized interaction as well as incredibly low rates. Effective marketing for credit unions build your brand with a relatable personality.

<strong>4. Stand for something</strong>

Unlike big banks, credit unions are just as the name suggests—a union. This allows you to take a stand, putting your voice proudly behind a local cause. Get the community activated around a mutual concern to show that you’re more than just talk.

Every member is an owner, show them what that sort of power can look like, and the difference each person can make. Effective credit union marketing should address an issue that matters to your target market. This helps to humanize your brand and strengthen the team that makes up your business.

<strong>5. Get grass-roots </strong>

Capitalize on the audience you have to get your brand making headlines. Big community events and pay-it-forward initiatives engage your audience in fun, effective ways that make a big splash. More than brand recognition and awareness, done right, these events make your target market wish they could be a part of your brand so that they could participate too. Getting the community energized, showcasing your brand, and driving headlines focused on initiatives can make a huge difference.

<strong>6. Give them what they want </strong>

Convenience. While credit unions aren’t run like banks, baking technology can be incredibly effective. Let your consumers manage their accounts on mobile and offer free downloadable tools such as tip calculators, budgeting apps, and loan calculators to make each member feel taken care of. While credit union management is made up of customers, every part-owner should still feel like a customer.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

When it comes to credit union marketing, it’s all about being human inside and out. Focus on showing off internal strengths through people-focused communications, establishing your brand as a community leader, and being transparent with the credit union business model.

Then take full advantage of external opportunities by taking a social stand, engaging with the community on a personal level, and providing convenient banking technologies to really set your company apart.

How to build trust through community bank marketing,"Many agencies and marketers like to think that finance is a big mystery—an animal all its own with completely different rules. In some ways it is, but in most ways, it isn’t. Effective branding gains attention and keeps it; just like it does in every other industry. Community bank marketing is very similar to small business marketing, it just calls for a more sophisticated twist.

Here are 3 key concepts for building trust in small banks:

<strong>1. Get personal, to an extent</strong>

Small banks have the unique opportunity to build strong interpersonal relationships. To not just become a brand or company name, but to become Sammy, the helpful man at the front desk, who can help you get what you need. He knows your name and asks about your son’s baseball games.

Let empathy drive your services so that your consumers feel valued. Show them directly how your customer relations can brighten their day while your services exceed every expectation. Leveraging expertise and friendly service, you can turn your brand into <a href=""https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2018/12/how-small-banks-can-market-generation-z"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a mentor</a> for each and every customer.

Find an agency that understands the delicate differentiators' in <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-messaging-services/"">voice and branding </a>to craft the perfect balance for your community. Drive real results with community bank marketing that cares just the right amount.

<strong>2. Leverage digital effectively</strong>

Digital is invaluable to community bank marketing because it’s a great way to establish one-on-one interaction and build strong relationships. Digital marketing for banks works a lot like digital marketing for anyone else but should be held to a higher standard. For example, a clothing company or salon should have Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts; while banks should be on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, but never Instagram. It’s just too casual.

The right <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/"">digital strategy </a>in banking is all about finding your line of sophistication and building that ever-important trust. Use digital in conjunction with strong branding to build effective consumer relationships. Post community views and common local phrases to evoke nostalgia and build understanding. Using effective bank marketing strategies, your brand can become a <a href=""https://www.blueskyeto.com/unique-local-bank-marketing-ideas/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">community pillar</a>.

Represent your brand as a member of the community and follow through. Post photos and short videos of the front office team to build a connection before a customer even sets foot through your doors. Show the management team doing community service and attending local events, embody your brand through human interaction. Demonstrate a neighborly connection to develop a real personality.

<strong>3. Embrace ever-evolving technology</strong>

Maneuverability is a great advantage that small banks have over large institutions. Every day enhanced technology is being developed in all aspects of every industry—including banking. Due to the security necessary throughout the banking process, it can take years to implement any one new process across an entire large bank. For a community bank, that same process can take just a few months.

Incorporate cutting edge technologies into your services to provide convenience as well as modernity for your customers. Leverage your agility and technological know-how in your brand’s bank marketing ideas. This will draw in young consumers looking for a better way to the bank as well as the older markets that simply enjoy the advantages offered by new technologies.

More than a novelty, technology can cut your company’s operational costs while allowing for more personal service. Incorporating a one-on-one, on-demand experience for consumers to interact with your brand without having to walk in. Utilize effective customer service in combination with technology to <a href=""https://www.chiefoutsiders.com/blog/bid/100598/5-marketing-strategies-community-banks-use-to-move-past-competitors"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">add value to your services</a>. Remember, it’s nice to like your bankers but your bottom-line is built on trust, experience, and results.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Small banks have a lot more going for them than meets the eye. Make sure your brand’s target audience understands all that your company brings to the table through genuine connection built the right way, digital that effectively reaches consumers and furthers that connection, and unique offerings that only smaller institutions can accomplish.

It can be a lot to manage yourself. Don’t hesitate to reach out to an advertising agency that understands the demands, opportunities, and limitations that your company faces.

How can small banks compete against large banks? Supercharged SEO,"The banking industry has been consolidating for 30 years, dropping from 14,000 banks in 1985 to <a href=""https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/survival-strategy-cut-the-number-of-banks-in-half"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">fewer than 5,000 today</a>. With smaller players being swallowed by industry heavyweights, it's natural for community banks to wonder how well they can compete against national lenders. Fortunately, there's one simple tactic that can help even the playing field: Well-executed SEO services grounded in a deep understanding of local buyers.

<strong>How community banks can gain an SEO edge</strong>

Community banks are, at their core, local businesses. While they might not be capitalized at the level of the big banks, they can instead compete on responsiveness and understanding of the local market.

A local SEO strategy also pays dividends. Banks should give each of their local branches a <a href=""https://www.banknews.com/blog/how-community-banks-can-win-in-seo/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">dedicated web pag</a>e rather than having each branch listed through a simple location finder. These pages should include information about each branch and its neighborhood and should be optimized for SEO. This means taking commonly searched phrases relating to banking in that area and incorporating them into the body and metadata of branch pages.

<strong>The power of the public's endorsement</strong>

Adding customer reviews for each local branch to individual pages is also a smart tactic. Reviews play a critical role in establishing credibility and are a key cog in the conversion process.

This also extends to external entities such as Yelp! and other directories. Establishing a presence on these outside sites does more than allowing you to bump your online review count. Sites such as Yelp! validate your bank's address, phone number, and name with Google's search algorithm, giving your site a rankings boost. Linking with high authority publishers is also key. Inbound links coming from high authority publishers is perhaps the most consistently effective tactic in the SEO playbook.

<strong>Staying on top of local search terms</strong>

It's also critical to give extensive thought to the kind of questions prospective customers are searching for in your region -- everything from ""how to open a checking account"" to ""nearest bank to me.""

These are the kind of questions for which community banks want to rank, so it's important that they are addressed somewhere within your online presence. You can address them both on your sites and within the content you publish.

<strong>Stressing your competitive advantages</strong>

Community banks should play to their strengths when <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-agency/"">marketing</a>. Larger banks tend to be viewed as faceless monoliths who treat their customers like a number on a spreadsheet. Community banks, on the other hand, are in a position to establish personal relationships by properly utilizing SEO services.

This may not affect whether a customer qualifies for a loan, but it does impact how customers feel about their experience. Community banks should underline the closer, more responsive nature of their relationships with customers in their marketing messages.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Small banks can neutralize the advantages of larger competitors by highlighting the benefits of a more personal approach and pursuing a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/"">smart SEO strategy</a>. If you'd like to hear more about the impact of high-level SEO services, <a href=""http://www.bigeyeagency.com/contact/"">reach out</a> to our banking experts today.

How Pier 1 increased consumer response through data strategy,"Here's an astonishing statistic: CMOs spend 20% of their budgets on creative, yet <a href=""https://www.persado.com/2019/03/how-pier-1-made-the-journey-to-data-driven-creative/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">71% of them</a> don't believe creative actually drives results. It's a statistic that points to a much larger crisis of confidence within the marketing realm.

So how are brands that are unwilling to accept this state of affairs responding? By taking a more numbers-based, scientific approach to marketing through display advertising services.

<strong>How Pier 1 automated its marketing messaging</strong>

The creative process in marketing is largely unchanged from its early history. People use a mélange of assumptions, guesswork and qualitative data to inform their creative approach. It's art and science – a mix of intuition and information. Sometimes this approach works, but more often it results in work that's too broad or somewhat misaligned with the audience.

In recent years, however, new data tools have been developed that allow for the creative process to be guided by fact rather than supposition. Today's machines can analyze robust data sets with extreme precision, uncovering actionable insights and learning as they go.

Pier 1 offers an interesting example of this trend toward data-driven marketing. The company partnered with Persado to optimize the language used across customer marketing content. The technology involved in the campaign has the ability to alter the language seen in display ads in accordance with an individual consumer's preferences.

Using the Persado platform &amp; display advertising services, Pier 1 was able to compare customer engagement and response levels for various sponsored ads, each with different photos, captions, hashtags and headlines. The impact of each ad and its constituent elements is measured in real time to see how well or how poorly they resonate with customers.

In essence, the technology is a sophisticated form of A/B testing that includes a machine-learning component that composes new marketing messages guided by real-time feedback. All of it is based on linguistic science. The underlying technology analyzes millions of language variations to create an optimal message. The natural language processing algorithm used by Persado is designed to understand a brand's specific voice and replicate it across all channels.

<strong>Why a data-guided approach is smarter</strong>

Consumers are bombarded with marketing messages. If they deign to give you their attention, you can be certain that concession will be almost instantly revoked if the message they are experiencing isn't immediately compelling. Because of this, presentation is critical.

Data-focused tools such as the algorithm deployed by Persado &amp; proper display advertising services can play a critical role in helping brands quantify audience response to messages. These tools play an equally important role in helping brands optimize their messages by incorporating this feedback and making informed adjustments in real time.

That doesn't mean that marketing is now purely a science. As far as machine learning has come, it remains limited in many key respects. The optimal approach for most brands involves working with <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/display-advertising-services/"">an agency</a> that integrates data-based tools and human insight into one holistic marketing framework.

Senior living communities connect with Baby Boomers through digital,"The Baby Boomers created the counterculture -- and our modern conception of youth culture along with it. One of the generation's biggest bands, The Who, memorably sang the line ""I hope I die before I get old.""

Yet age comes for us all. Though many Baby Boomers may hate to admit it, they are squarely in their Golden Years -- and many of them are now exploring senior living, often with the help of their Gen X children.

So how do senior living facilities market to the demographic that invented youth culture? Certainly not the way they marketed to the parents of Boomers, a generation with vastly different lived experiences. Partnering with the right <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-marketing-consultant/""><u>senior living marketing</u></a> agency can help brands meet this challenge, and craft a marketing plan designed to resonate with the Woodstock generation.

<strong>Why Baby Boomers view senior living through a different prism</strong>

There are two reasons why senior living communities need to recalibrate their digital marketing efforts for Baby Boomers. First, this generation has a much different conception of retirement and aging. The notion of 40 years, a gold watch and a quiet life playing shuffleboard hold no attraction. Baby Boomers don't believe they are ""old"" in the same way their parents' generation was -- even if the calendar says otherwise.

The second reason: This self-conception is backed up by a profoundly important trend. Thanks to advances in medicine and a cultural shift toward health and wellness, people are not only living longer but staying youthful and vibrant even into their later years. In 1980, a 70-year-old was often prematurely aged by a lifetime of red meat, smoking, drinking, and minimal exercise. Today's 70-year-old is often well-preserved by a healthy lifestyle supported by advances in modern medicine.

<strong>How senior living communities can reach this demographic</strong>

In order to <a href=""https://seniorhousingnews.com/2019/01/06/top-senior-housing-trends-for-2019/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>effectively market</u></a> senior living communities, it's important to keep a few important ideas in mind:
<ul>
 	<li>Despite the popular misconception, Baby Boomers are not anti-technology, afraid of technology or hopelessly inept when using technology. Baby Boomers invented the Internet and the World Wide Web; they outspend millennials almost two to one on online purchases.</li>
 	<li>Baby Boomers spend 27 hours each week online. Roughly <a href=""https://medium.com/@LiquidLockMedia/12-outstanding-statistics-on-baby-boomers-and-social-media-2be6c49b5b91"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>82% of them </u></a>have at least one social media account. In other words, they are a perfect audience for <u><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/social-media-strategy-company/"">digital marketing and social media marketing</a>.</u></li>
 	<li>Baby Boomers seeking to make an informed decision about which senior community to choose will typically turn to social media reviews and testimonial videos to get their search process started.</li>
 	<li>When designing a marketing campaign, senior living marketing agencies should help you stress the elements that appeal to Baby Boomers. Recreational facilities, onsite enrichment classes, yoga, culinary offerings, group excursions, property amenities -- all of these things should play a central role in any digital campaign. Baby Boomers want vibrant, healthy, stimulating communities and marketing messages should reflect this.</li>
 	<li>Baby Boomers and their Gen X children want to make the most informed decisions possible about senior living. One of the best ways to approach this is through <a href=""https://seniorhousingnews.com/2019/01/06/top-senior-housing-trends-for-2019/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>social media storytelling</u></a>. Have existing residents tell their own stories about living onsite and share these across all social channels.</li>
 	<li>Make sure you have accessible health data: Rate of falls, hospital readmission rates, etc. Prospective clients will ask for it.</li>
</ul>

Precision and reach: Why streaming TV is a powerful weapon for DTC brands,"When it comes to advertising and marketing, Direct to Consumer (DTC) brands is best known for sponsored social media posts and banner ads. This makes perfect sense, given their low overhead and brand-focused business model. Yet many of these brands are migrating to a new channel -- streaming TV -- and partnering with top video production services to create compelling content designed to connect with a younger, mobile-first audience.

<strong>Why DTC brands are choosing connected TV as a channel</strong>

New research from Hulu and Telaria (a video adtech firm) underlines the potential impact streaming TV can have for DTC brands. Roughly 70% of DTC consumers indicated they spend more time watching streaming TV each week than they spend on social media. These consumers reported spending approximately 13 hours watching streaming TV each week -- a figure 20% higher than their reported consumption of traditional broadcasting.

As a recent piece in <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/want-to-target-dtc-shoppers-go-with-ctv/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Adfreak+%28Adfreak%29"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em><u>Adweek</u></em></a> maintains, this shift in media watching patterns is now being reflected in the retail sector. Brands are cognizant of this reordering of viewing habits and seeking to benefit from it. A recent report from the Video Advertising Bureau showed that the top DTC brands spent roughly $2 billion on streaming ads in 2018, a figure that likely represents just the tip of the iceberg in terms of ad spend in coming years. In just the last two years, DTC brands doubled their total streaming ad spend.

<strong>Why DTC brands are choosing streaming TV</strong>

Traditional broadcast TV isn't an ideal fit for many DTC brands for two reasons: It's expensive, and it targets a general audience. Streaming services, however, offer DTC brands the ability to target audiences with much greater precision. As <em>Adweek </em>notes, this gives DTC brands the benefits of TV (spectacle, sight, sound, motion through excellent video production services) and marries it with the precision of digital advertising.

How much of an impact does this added precision have? According to the Hulu/Telaria study, shoppers are twice as likely to purchase a product after seeing it in a streaming ad as opposed to a traditional ad. Study respondents also indicated they found streaming TV ads to be more relevant than traditional TV ads -- hardly a surprise given the scattershot nature of conventional television advertising.

By focusing on streaming ads, DTC brands also gain much more insight into the purchase cycle. <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/media-buying-agency/digital-media-buying-agency/"">Gaining insight into ad placement and audience targeting</a> allows these brands to better define conversion rates and customer acquisition costs.

Ultimately, streaming TV ads formerly came with a major trade-off for brands -- audiences were much, much smaller than those watching traditional, linear TV. However, that state of affairs is rapidly changing. As streaming audiences grow, the value of advertising through this channel grows in parallel.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

At BIGEYE, we understand the value of a highly targeted, creatively inspired, and well-executed streaming ad campaign for DTC businesses.

Shoppable search and Instagram checkout: What brands need to know,"Retailers and consumers take note: Google and Instagram are determined to radically simplify the buyer's journey. Elegant simplicity is one of the highest aims of user experience, and both Google and Instagram are making moves to simplify and streamline purchases made within their ecosystems.

Brands are in a position to reap significant rewards from these efforts -- and the right media planning agency can help them take advantage.

<strong>The birth of ""Checkout on Instagram""</strong>

Instagram is a natural space for e-commerce -- it's a highly visual medium that lends itself perfectly to product showcasing and placement. With the recent introduction of ""Checkout on Instagram,"" the platform is on the way to realizing its e-commerce potential.

The <a href=""https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-launches-checkout-on-instagram-to-facilitate-in-app-shopping/550834/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">new feature</a> works like this: Instead of seeing a ""view on website"" button when using Instagram's shopping tags feature; platform users will see a ""check out on Instagram"" button. By pressing this button, users can immediately purchase the item they are viewing without being referred to a third-party site.

Instagram will make these in-platform checkouts fairly seamless by storing payment data from users' first purchase, which eliminates the need for payment details to be entered repeatedly. Users can also track delivery and shipment information directly within Instagram.

Currently, this feature is a closed beta with only 23 pre-selected businesses participating. Instagram will charge each business a fee for each completed transaction. However, given the platform's reach (one billion active users) that seems like a price most businesses and media planning agencies will be willing to pay.

<strong>Google extends shoppable ads to image search results</strong>

Customers (and brands) are always searching for ways to reduce the number of touch points on the path to a sale. Google is particularly well positioned to provide greater simplicity thanks to its massive search index and image library.

Now, the company is capitalizing on that positioning by introducing shoppable ads to Google Images search results. Taking a cue from Pinterest (which recently announced its shopping results would be positioned at the top of search pages) and Instagram, brands can now tag multiple products on an ad. Users then see the product type and price when hovering.

During a <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/google-is-bringing-shoppable-ads-to-images-results/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">keynote talk at Shoptalk</a> (a retail industry conference), Google President of Retail Shopping and Payments Daniel Alegre said Shoppable Ads would help better connect brands and consumers by reducing touch points.

By making these images shoppable, Google allows retailers to theoretically <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/conversion-marketing-agency/"">increase conversions</a> by interacting with consumers when they are primed and ready to buy. The greater the number of touch points, the higher the potential for a consumer to become sidetracked or successfully converted by a competitor.

Given the combined activities of Instagram, Google, and Pinterest, it's clear that major platforms are seeking to make search results and ads more shoppable. These efforts dovetail nicely with the desire of audiences for simpler, faster, and better e-commerce options.

The consumer experience: brands overpromise and under-deliver,"You don't have to run a brand strategy agency to understand the importance of the customer experience. Creating a personal connection with audiences through meaningful experiences is the gold standard of modern marketing and its value is repeated ad nauseam.

Yet simply because we all pay lip service to this notion doesn't mean we're actually getting it accomplished. Many brands are still falling woefully short in terms of delivering a <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/partner-articles/how-digital-technologies-can-help-build-a-human-brand/?mvt=o&amp;mvn=aa8ed8c02fde4eb8975a2a5a217050f8&amp;mvp=NA-ADWEEKRESPSITE-11238673&amp;mvl=homepage-grid-placement-large"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>compelling cross-channel consumer experience.</u></a>

So what's the key to unlocking these sought after, but rarely realized, customer experiences?

Building a more human brand.

<strong>Taking your brand's pulse</strong>

According to the most recent Forrester U.S. Customer Experience Index, there has been a minimal improvement in the overall quality of <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/""><u>consumer experiences</u></a>. Think about this: Though brands and their CMOs line up to testify to the necessity of great customer experiences, the actual customers are deeply unimpressed.

Clearly, something is fundamentally amiss. Put simply, brands are focusing far too much on product experience and much too little on the human experience. If you want to connect at a deeper level, you need to move beyond the way people interact with products in a narrow use case sense, and instead consider the <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/branding-agency/brand-story-agency/""><u>full range </u></a>of feelings, desires, hopes, aspirations, etc. that are connected with any product or service.

We certainly have the right tools at our disposal. Today's digital technologies facilitate the kind of close engagement with audiences that would have been unthinkable just a decade or two ago.

<strong>A date with implementation</strong>

So how can these tools be deployed in service of more human-centric experiences? Consider the following:

We like to think we are rational creatures.

The truth, however, is that emotion guides us more often than not. A few years ago, leading neuroscientist Antonio Damaso made a pioneering discovery. Damaso studied subjects who had experienced serious damage to the part of the brain where emotions are generated. Everyone he studied had an unusual commonality -- they<u> <a href=""https://bigthink.com/experts-corner/decisions-are-emotional-not-logical-the-neuroscience-behind-decision-making"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">struggled mightily</a> </u>with even the simplest decision-making. Brands need to understand the profound role emotion plays in how consumers respond to marketing messages and optimize accordingly.

The best ideas and intentions are often utterly lost in execution.

It's one thing to conceptualize human experiences; it's another thing entirely to deliver them effectively. Forward-thinking brand strategy agencies grasp the importance of digital tools in this process. According to Gartner, 63% of CMOs are expecting an increase in their innovation budget. If you want to deliver personalized experiences, you need to build the architecture to do so.

The consumer/brand relationship is being utterly transformed.

But not every brand is at the same place on the acceleration curve. The days of deploying one size fit all marketing, selling a product and periodically keeping in touch with consumers are long gone. Today, the most successful brands build communities; they encourage constant digital interaction and engagement; they facilitate a continuous relationship that integrates directly into a consumer's lifestyle. These brands aren't merely companies -- they are, in many ways, an extension of the consumer themselves.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Digital technologies have created tectonic shifts in the ways brands sell and market their products and services. The <u><a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/creative-services/campaign-brand-development-company/"">best brand strategy agencies</a> </u>understand these changes and help position brands for maximum competitive advantage.

Want effective property management marketing? Mind your P’s & C’s,"Social media moves fast -- so it's critical to stay up to date with the most innovative new ideas. The recent Multifamily Social Media Summit gave property management professionals the perfect opportunity to exchange such ideas and ruminate on the state of property management <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-content-agency/"">social media marketing.</a>

If you weren't able to travel to Napa Valley to attend the conference, don't worry -- we'll take a seep dive to highlight all the most intriguing ideas.

<strong>Avoiding the ""deadly four Ps""</strong>

Have you ever noticed that brands within some industries handle their social media with much more skill than brands in others? Part of this has to do with the nature of the business -- it's hard to make industrial supplies compelling, for example.

Property management falls somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. Yet this isn't necessarily a bad thing. For property management firms that get social media right, it's a chance to become highly differentiated within their market.

One of the easiest ways to get it right is to prioritize storytelling. Let's face it: Most people don't care about the<a href=""https://www.propertymanagementinsider.com/multifamily-social-media-lessons"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> ""deadly four P’s,""</a> as marketer Steve Crescenzo refers to them: Policies, programs, products and procedures. What do they care about? According to Crescenzo, the ""four Cs"" -- compelling, creative, concise and conversational content.

Partner with a property management social media marketing firm to present your content in the form of a narrative, rather than a dry report where you're simply pushing out information, and you'll keep your audience from tuning out.

<strong>Higher impact on a lower budget</strong>

Every marketer has heard it repeated ad nauseam: Video is critical to your success. More video content is now being uploaded <a href=""https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">every 30 days</a> than all the content the broadcast TV networks have ever created. Additionally, audiences report deeper engagement with video content.

Unfortunately, video does present challenges. Many brands don't have the time or the budget to create high-level video content on a consistent basis. However, there is a simple solution -- the use of short animated videos. These videos are high impact and relatively inexpensive to produce.

By partnering with the right property management social media-marketing agency, multifamily businesses can reap the benefits of video marketing within their social efforts without deploying excessive resources.

<strong>An influential marketing approach</strong>

Influencer marketing isn't new or novel, but it's just now gaining traction within the multifamily space. By joining forces with an influencer, brands gain access to highly engaged users and receive an endorsement that carries more weight than traditional online marketing messages. The best influencers combine the weight and value of a word of mouth recommendation with the reach of digital.

Some multifamily properties are taking this strategy to the next level by offering free or discounted living space to partnered influencers. These influencers agree to share their living experiences within the community on <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/social-media-marketing/social-media-management-company/"">social media</a> in exchange for this consideration.

While partnering with influencers does require some due diligence and careful guidelines in terms of how content is presented, it's a strategy that makes sense for multifamilies seeking to improve engagement and grow their social media audience.

"What cheap coffee, stolen grease, and great explainer videos have in common","Generating compelling marketing concepts is any creative agency's meat and potatoes. However, even after you've had a creative epiphany, you still need to figure out the best way to spread your message. For many brands, that means a well-executed explainer video created by a top motion graphics design company.

For inspiration, look no further than Burger King.

<strong>A whopper of an idea</strong>

Burger King's been all over the news in recent weeks. First, a Virginia man was caught using a siphon and a 1,600 gallon tank to<u> <a href=""https://thetakeout.com/virginia-man-stole-theft-burger-king-used-grease-oil-1834214344"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">steal massive amounts</a> </u>of used Whopper grease from his local Burger King franchises.

This viral crime occurred just days after Burger King debuted its Impossible Whopper,<u> <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a plant-based burger </a></u>that has drawn national acclaim for its uncanny similarity to beef.

Yet for those in the marketing world, a third recent story proved even more interesting: Burger King's first foray into subscription coffee.

As any venture capitalist would tell you, subscription plays are sizzling at the moment. Name a product category, and there are multiple brands ready to deliver their take on it for a monthly fee.

Burger King capitalized on this trend by announcing a new promotion that allows anyone to purchase a month-long subscription to Burger King coffee for the price of one Starbucks latte ($5).

There were, of course, some exclusions: Only one coffee per day, and no iced coffee, specialty coffee or other fancy java concoctions. Strictly black coffee with cream and sugar.

Despite these limitations, the campaign garnered plenty of notice, including <u><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/burger-king-launches-5-monthly-coffee-subscription"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">national media coverage</a> </u>and lots of social media buzz. That's hardly surprising, given the burger purveyor's reputation for being a savvy social media operator -- and a skilled creator of slightly salty explainer videos made by their motion graphics design company.

<strong>Double espresso shots fired</strong>

Burger King's clever take on the subscription model was supported by an explainer video distributed across the company's social media accounts. The video gave viewers step by step instructions for signing up for $5 coffee, delivered over a blurting synth line punctuated with retro handclaps.

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ef2bbIfwNU"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><u>The video</u></a> did an excellent job illustrating the ease by which consumers can earn discounted coffee -- download an app, sign up, click a button to redeem and head to your local Burger King. The explainer video sealed the deal by taking a couple of pointed shots at Starbucks (""you don't have to speak Italian to order BK coffee"" and ""we won't misspell your name”).""

By creating this explainer video, Burger King accomplished a few important things: It explained the campaign's value proposition (a month of coffee for less than a latte), it drove more signups for the BK app (driving digital engagement) and it entertained its target audience while calling out a rival.

BK coffee might not be bold -- but their marketing strategy &amp; motion graphics design company certainly is.

What drones can teach marketers about knowing their audience,"Any great <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/audience-segmentation-consultant/"">audience segmentation consultant</a> will tell you it's essential to know your market. Yet the real challenge often comes next: How do you make your brand stand out to your audience in a cluttered advertising landscape?

Given how fractured the industry has become with the emergence of social media and other digital mediums, combining those two objectives is a core challenge -- one that often marks the difference between success and failure.

If you want to see a current example of brands negotiating this challenge in a lightning-fast, obstacle-filled environment, look no further than professional drone racing.

<strong>Connecting to audiences via unmanned aerial exhibitions</strong>

The Drone Racing League (DRL) is a professional league for people who race their drones on real tracks at speeds in excess of 80 miles-per-hour. The league also offers one intriguing example of brands using highly-targeted marketing in a new and unusual setting to reach their desired audience.

Why is a relatively niche organization such as the DRL notable in this context? For brands, it's all about positioning and connection. Telecom giant Cox Communications recently partnered with the DRL to create a <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/the-drone-racing-league-is-changing-the-way-brands-partner-with-sports-leagues/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cox marketing campaign</a> that was entirely conceived and executed by the league's internal media and marketing teams.

The goal was simple: Position Cox not as a stodgy legacy cable company, but rather an innovation-focused firm dedicated to building the infrastructure of the future for its audience. Partnering with a cutting-edge sport rooted in innovative technology positioned Cox in a way that a similar partnership with a Madison Avenue ad agency could not.

As part of the campaign, Cox sponsored one of the DRL's top pilots -- Nick ""Wild Willy"" Willard -- and created a clever ad focusing on the drone racing star. In the ad, Willard pilots his Cox WiFi-powered drone through his mother's house, without breaking anything valuable. This ad was used in a <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/multi-channel-marketing-agency/"">multi-channel campaign </a>designed to boost awareness for Cox and the DRL.

<strong>Advertising at high speed for a skeptical audience</strong>

As you might imagine, advertising on a drone track comes with some specific challenges. Fans of drone racing tend to skew younger and are highly tech savvy. Unlike NASCAR fans (who don't mind being barraged with ads), drone racing fans largely recoil at overt marketing. Which is why an audience segmentation consultant is necessary.

DRL CEO Nicholas Horbaczewski told <em>Adweek </em>that if he installs a conventional billboard at a drone race, fans would <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/how-drone-racing-league-is-integrating-brands-into-its-races/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">""throw up all over it.""</a>  He added that drone racing fans find such advertising displays ""offensive"" and don't wish to communicate with brands in this format.

To address this preference, the DRL integrates advertising within the course in the form of physical obstacles named for advertisers. Drone pilots must navigate course obstacles such as the ""Swatch Gate."" in order to successfully complete the race.

An even more ambitious brand integration will occur later in 2019, when the DRL will partner with Lockheed Martin to stage races pitting human drone pilots against drones flown by AI. More than 250 research universities have applied to enter the contest, which will offer more than $2 million in prizes.

Why digital marketing drives revenue in the multifamily industry,"The multifamily industry has long used traditional advertising and marketing approaches to drive revenue through local TV, brochures, etc. Yet as the industry changes to adapt to larger societal changes, these legacy approaches need to play a more complementary role. Today, multifamily digital marketing supported by data-driven insights is the best way to reach audiences and create sustainable revenue.

<strong>How digital marketing helps cultivate leads and meet occupancy goals</strong>

What's driving the multifamily space's foray into data-powered digital marketing? According to <u><a href=""https://www.propertymanagementinsider.com/convergence-data-digital-marketing-multifamily"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">some industry observers,</a> </u>digital marketing is essential in order to help resolve several entrenched business problems. These include diagnosing underperforming properties, identifying gaps in lead management and merchandising specific product types (such as floor plans and unit sizes) on demand.

By integrating data analytics into their approach, multifamily operators are able to gain the insight they need to convert leads more effectively and identify inefficiencies and opportunities within specific properties. Decisions supported by real-time data can help managers increase yield and minimize lost opportunities.

So how are multifamily operators incorporating these strategies? By mastering the fundamentals: High-quality lead generation, a robust online presence (great UX, compelling content, and tools such as online chatbots) lead forms, and contact centers.

<strong>Other key developments</strong>

Multifamily digital marketing tactics need to extend beyond lead management and <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/web-design-development-company/web-development-company/""><u>well-designed websites</u></a>. Marketers in this space should also give due consideration to the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Consumer search preferences are evolving. Multifamily operators must stay current on<a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/seo-services/""> <u>SEO best practices </u></a>in order to ensure visibility when prospective customers search for properties within their area. This is especially true given the impact of Google Places on organic search placement.</li>
 	<li>Internet Lead Management (ILM) analytics can help property managers gain deeper insight into the lifecycle of a lead and how various channels are performing. ILM analytics can also provide a window into performance on the agent level, as communication can be analyzed to determine what prospects are responding to and what they aren't. Analytics can also shine a light on whether there is a problem within the lead management process, or the sales process.</li>
 	<li>Data-driven insights can also help optimize revenue management. Property managers can identify upcoming occupancy problems and make adjustments to ensure that rates remain stable. Those adjustments may include ramping up an existing marketing campaign to get additional prospects in the sales pipeline, or hitting pause on a campaign if long-term occupancy projections are higher than previously thought. Property managers can also use digital tools to introduce dynamic pricing, optimizing revenue based on shorter-term demand fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The takeaway</strong>

The multifamily property space is quickly modernizing its marketing approach, shifting from traditional TV ads and brochures to sophisticated, data-driven digital marketing. This approach is paying significant dividends in terms of creating more leads, optimizing lead management, and improving revenue management practices.

Next gen TV trends and how they can impact your brand,"<strong>Next gen TV, also known as ATSC 3.0, is redefining traditional broadcast TV by breathing new life into the aging medium.</strong>

So now we answer the first question, what is ATSC 3.0? It’s the update that broadcast TV has been severely lacking. This new system will leverage current technologies to enhance picture, sound, framerate, and overall range of the medium without losing a moment of your favorite shows. ATSC 3.0 technology enhances everything about broadcast to bring it into the digital age. This will reinvigorate traditional TV, and dramatically increase its value as an advertising medium.

<strong>What will change</strong>

The short answer? Everything. But let’s start with picture. The current—let’s call it classic, broadcast system caps out at 1080p. Next gen TV will span all the way to <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/atsc-3-0-ota-broadcast-standard-4k-dolby-atmos/2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">4K</a>! Making the new ATSC standard an HDTV over the air experience. Raising the quality of the experience without adding cost, the ATSC 3.0 system will drive conversion like never before.

Furthermore, next gen TV is designed to be an ever-evolving technology. Building on the concept of <a href=""https://www.atsc.org/newsletter/atsc-3-0-where-we-stand/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">technological adaption</a>, ATSC 3.0 is designed for easy integration as new technologies develop. This way, broadcast television will not fall behind as time passes. Allowing room for future growth is an incredible capability for any technology in this day and age. This system will entice users who want to get the best service over time without paying to switch hardware or service providers as technologies evolve.

This broadcast method will also have a stronger, wider range. Meaning that every user will receive more channels in higher quality without the need for a large antenna. The system will even allow mobile devices to access broadcast shows. By building in capabilities across devices, broadcast TV is broadening its scope and making itself a far more advantageous advertising tool.

<strong>The impact</strong>

Next gen TV enables stronger <a href=""https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/sinclair-is-upgrading-90-tv-stations-for-atsc-3-0-next-gen-ota-tv/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">geo-targeting</a> capabilities than cable or satellite TV. As over-the-air TV is intrinsically contained in a specific geographic area, it is a medium that lends itself to <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/digital-marketing-services/digital-targeting-retargeting-services/"">area-specific messaging</a>. This makes next gen TV the perfect platform for local businesses such as community banks, mom-and-pop shops, and more to reach their target market without breaking the bank.

<strong>How it works</strong>

This system is able to achieve its unique capabilities by connecting on more than one front. The classic broadcast system is accessed simply by an antenna while the next gen TV system uses both an antenna and a wi-fi connection to strengthen the quality and broaden the service range; This is also what allows it to be accessed across devices.

Not only is ATSC 3.0 perfect for geo-targeting, but by enabling tracking as well as use across devices it presents as both a traditional and digital media. With next gen TV, experienced advertisers can reach their audience on a whole new level.

<strong>The takeaway</strong>

Broadcast TV is getting a much-needed facelift that will skyrocket its importance both as a service and as an advertising medium. Paying attention to this change now will open up avenues for effective, low-cost <a href=""https://www.bigeyeagency.com/marketing-services/marketing-strategy-agency/"">campaign strategies</a> that will reach the right people, at the right time, for the right price.
